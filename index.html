			 <p>When I was probably 15 years old, a nerdy homeschooled kid living in Texas, I was one day browsing a clothing rack at some cheap retailer - probably K-Mart or whatever the 1990’s equivalent of TJMaxx is today - and finding a royal blue t-shirt with the Yale Bulldogs logo on it. I knew Yale was a prestigious school but not much more than that. My nerdy self sort of liked the shirt, so I bought it and wore it regularly. Occasionally I would get questions on it. “Are you going to Yale?” No, I would reply, I just liked the shirt. In these pre-Internet (at least for us!) days, what I knew about Yale was basically what my folks had said: super-expensive, super-liberal. We were super-conservative and super-poor, so that was basically that. (I eventually attended a less-expensive, but still private, Christian university that was a lot closer to home.)</p>
<p>It was only much later in my life that I realized that the catalog price published for university tuition is like the “room rate” you see posted on the inside of hotel room doors - a huge number that frequently doesn’t reflect the reality of what you’ll have to put out of pocket. In retrospect, my story had all the hallmarks of a good case for a big Ivy League scholarship. A unique educational background. Fantastic test scores and grades. Superb writing skills. Reasonable extracurriculars. In reality’s timeline, I took the highest scholarship that LeTourneau gave for academics (only 20% of my yearly cost!), coupled it with a bunch of grants, and still paid off college loans for a decade afterward. I got a reasonably good education at LeTourneau, met my wife there, got a job, moved to Iowa, hadn’t thought about Yale in a long time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year my work team won a big corporate award, and earlier this week we got to travel to one of our big corporate headquarters sites in Connecticut to be honored at an awards banquet. We all got to bring a +1, so we had several spouses in attendance too. Becky came along and we lightly stretched the travel to make a mini-vacation of it. (As much as a 3-day, 2-night trip can be a vacation, I guess.)</p>
<p>One of those days while we were out sightseeing we drove out to New Haven and spent a couple hours walking around the Yale campus, visiting its museums, sticking our heads into the old buildings, and generally taking in the scene. We’ve walked around a few college campuses the past few years with the kids doing college tours themselves. Campuses have a unique energy, and at an elite school this is amplified. On one hand, I observed, it’s <em>Yale</em> - everybody there is special. That’s sort of table stakes for admission. On the other hand, it’s clear that all these “special” students are still really just 18-to-20-something college kids.</p>
<p>I wondered, as we walked down the shady streets and past the old stone buildings, how would 18-year-old Chris have handled Yale? It would’ve been a move halfway across the country, a country boy plopped down in an East coast city, a sheltered conservative religious kid at a secular institution. Would I have been the stubborn fundamentalist arguing with all my professors? The church kid who went to college and gave up his faith? Or could the sudden emergence from my evangelical bubble have accelerated my movement toward the more tolerant, liberal faith that I have finally come to in my 40s?</p>
<p>What-if’s like this are to a great extent pointless. There are no do-overs. I’m happy and content with where my path has taken me. I was probably better suited for engineering than humanities or law, anyway. But for one fall afternoon, it was fun to walk down the streets of New Haven and idly imagine other pasts.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://wapo.st/3APnSkZ">a wonderful long-form profile on the Washington Post right now</a> about Chris Mark, a man who eschewed an opportunity for a upper-class education to (literally) go work in the coal mines, and ended up revolutionizing coal mine safety. (That&rsquo;s a gift link, so you can read it whether you&rsquo;re a WaPo subscriber or not.) It&rsquo;s a compelling story of a man, driven by some complex family dynamics, who found his niche and ended up in a government job where he could follow that interest in a direction that has resulted in countless miners' lives saved over his career.</p>
<p>The value of experts in government driving regulation gets stated explicitly late in the piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every now and then, however, Chris’s work slipped into public view. His coal mine roof rating was used all over the world and, in his own narrow circles, he was well known. In 2016 — the first year in recorded history that zero underground coal miners were killed by falling roofs — Chris landed in a public spat. He’d seen an article by an economic historian about the history of roof bolts in the Journal of Technology and Culture. The historian wanted to argue that roof bolts had taken 20 years to reduce fatality rates because it had taken 20 years for the coal mining industry to learn to use them. All by itself, the market had solved this worker safety problem! The government’s role, in his telling, was as a kind of gentle helpmate of industry. “It was kind of amazing,” said Chris. “What actually happened was the regulators were finally empowered to regulate. Regulators needed to be able to enforce. He elevated the role of technology. He minimized the role of regulators.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Government functionaries can be an easy target for criticism, but this profile highlights the key and dedicated role that so many play in today&rsquo;s society. In my own work I have encountered many Federal Aviation Administration employees who fit a similar profile. They found some particular niche interest related to flying, and they made it their life&rsquo;s work to make it better and safer. It&rsquo;s often a thankless job, and on a government pay scale that pales next to what they could likely make in industry.</p>
<p>(As a side note, this is part of what makes <a href="https://www.kettering.org/news/the-schedule-f-threat-to-democracy-a-project-2025-explainer/">Trump&rsquo;s Project 2025 intentions to politicize the civil service</a> so terrifying: it would eliminate protections on just these dedicated experts to replace them with people who don&rsquo;t know the topic but who donated to the right political cause. You wanna see the country (literally) crumble? Ditch all the regulatory experts like Chris Mark and replace them with Heritage Foundation interns.)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/09/02/david-bentley-harts.html">David Bentley Hart’s “The Experience of God”</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/09/02/david-bentley-harts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-09-02 09:51:53 -0500">Sep 2, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With some of my recent reading getting my mental wheels turning about the nature of who God is, I figured it was a reasonable time to pull <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Experience_of_God:_Being,_Consciousness,_Bliss"><em>The Experience of God</em></a> off my shelf. Right off the bat in the introduction, Hart promises what I was hoping for: “My intention is simply to offer a definition of the word ‘God’&hellip;” Unfortunately, 332 pages later, what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bentley_Hart">David Bentley Hart</a> has written isn’t at all simple, and approaches a definition of “God” only from an oblique angle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hart structures the book in three major parts. In the first, he clarifies that the “God” he is describing is the ultimate deity, the prime mover, from which all other creation and being have their source. It is here even in the beginning section that he starts taking aim at what appears to be his actual target with this book: the arguments of the popular atheists of the late 20th and early 21st century. (Richard Dawkins is a regular whipping boy.)</p>
<p>The second section (comprising the bulk of the book) is structured around three characteristics which Hart points to as the core aspects of God: being, consciousness, and bliss. Each of these (long) chapters seems less interested in enlightening the reader on who God is than in disputing with the atheists and materialists. God is the root of being, declares Hart, and anyone who says differently is just stupid. There is no materialist explanation for consciousness, says Hart, and the materialists who argue for an evolutionary reason and dismiss God are illogical and foolish. There is no evolutionary reason for a search for beauty, truth, and goodness, says Hart, and those who would try to argue thus are intellectually dishonest. So it goes.</p>
<p>Hart’s arguments are at his strongest when he’s arguing <em>for</em> something instead of railing against something. The first part of his chapter on bliss was particularly good in that regard. Sadly, most of the book goes the other direction.</p>
<p>It’s very hard to review Hart without taking his blustery style into consideration. He’s never met a big word he didn’t like. He makes huge sweeping assertions without any hint of supporting justification. He seems to think that just by declaring something “obviously” wrong that it’s obvious to everyone and doesn’t need explained. In doing so he dismissively waves away not just the weak sauce of people like Dawkins but also more substantive scientists and thinkers who deserve better. Hart falls almost into self-parody at the beginning of chapter six: “[W]e should not mistake every pronouncement made in an authoritative tone of voice for an established truth.” While aiming this at popular atheists, it’s an argument that is equally valid against Hart himself.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke about a preacher, who at one point in his sermon notes has written: “weak point, pound pulpit”. As a lay theologian and not much of a philosopher at all, my trouble with Hart’s book is that he does so much pulpit pounding it makes me suspect the strength of his points. Even in places where I find myself in agreement with his conclusions I have a hard time feeling like the book was beneficial.</p>

<li>First day of school today for our two oldest kids&hellip; both at college so we won&rsquo;t get chalkboard pics this year.</li>
<li>Back to a full work week; the summer grind seems to set in here in late August. I think our European friends have the right idea, just taking most of August for vacation.</li>
<li>A friend pinged yesterday to note it had been a year since a retreat we attended. That got me reflecting. It&rsquo;s been quite a year.</li>
<li>Turns out some combination of time, therapy, improved habits, loving family, and patience can produce good results, even in the midst of sadness and chaos.</li>
<li>How am I old enough to have <em>two</em> kids in college?!?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been umpiring rec league softball again this year and tonight is the end of our tournament. Forecast heat index: 115F. Oof.</li>
<li>Once we get past Labor Day, life speeds up&hellip; a lot of business travel this fall.</li>
<li>Related to a couple of these bullets: time to shop for a new suit. Think this time I&rsquo;m gonna invest a little bit and not just buy whatever I can find cheapest off the rack at Kohl&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>I keep thinking that if my life gets too slow once the kids are out of the house, I could get certified and start umpiring high school softball. Feels like one of those things that you would have to jump into with both feet and make a fairly exclusive hobby during the summer.</li>
<li>Picked a book up off the shelf for book club yesterday and had forgotten just how good that book is. Time for a re-read, maybe. I don&rsquo;t re-read too often.</li>
<li>If I stop and think a moment, I kinda wonder what things will look like a year from now when I look back on the (currently upcoming) year. Life is wild.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Currently reading Henri Nouwen’s <em>Reaching Out: The Three Movements of the Spiritual Life</em>. What a wonderful little book! This bit in particular hit home today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not too long ago a priest told me that he cancelled his subscription to the New York <em>Times</em> because he felt that the endless stories about war, crime, power games, and political manipulation only disturbed his mind and heart and prevented him from meditation and prayer.</p>
<p>That is a sad story because it suggests that only by denying the world can you live in it, that only by surrounding yourself by an artificial, self-induced quietude can you live a spiritual life. A real spiritual life is exactly the opposite: it makes us so alert and aware of the world around us, that all that is and happens becomes part of our contemplation and meditation and invites us to a free and fearless response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As timely in 2024 as it was when Nouwen wrote it in 1975. And I both understand the plight of the priest in his story and desire to have, as Nouwen says, a free and fearless response to all that happens around me.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I really appreciated <a href="https://www.the-reframe.com/the-normal-ones/">A.R. Moxon&rsquo;s weekend post</a> framing up the &ldquo;Weird&rdquo; discourse from the past week. (This long-ish excerpt is still really just an excerpt. Worth reading the whole thing.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not so very long ago, it wasn&rsquo;t normal to be trans or gay or even nonconforming to very strict gender roles in any way. It wasn&rsquo;t normal to be a woman with a powerful job. It wasn&rsquo;t even normal to be a woman with a paid job of any kind. It wasn&rsquo;t normal or even legal to be a woman with a bank account. It wasn&rsquo;t normal to be a woman who could just chart their own way in life, and make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives for themselves. And it wasn&rsquo;t normal to be Jewish, it wasn&rsquo;t normal to be Muslim, it wasn&rsquo;t normal to be Hindu, it wasn&rsquo;t normal to be an atheist; nor was it normal to be Black, or Asian, or any identity in a category called &ldquo;nonwhite&rdquo; that people used without really thinking about it. It wasn&rsquo;t normal to be chronically sick or disabled, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t normal to expect to be treated as a full member of society if your way of being was not normal. And there were many many other ways of being that weren&rsquo;t normal either. They were different, other—weird.</p>
<p>Some of these ways of being abnormal were permitted to a degree, others were not. They were permitted by The Normal Ones, who had the license to decide what identity was, and to establish the strictures which that identity must remain, outside of which that identity could not stray. And not so very long ago, one of the main requirements for anyone with a &ldquo;weird&rdquo; identity who was receiving from license for that identity was that they would agree that The Normal Ones had the right to bestow such a license, because they and only they were truly normal.</p>
<p>It was <em>normal</em> to be white. It was <em>normal</em> to be a Christian. It was <em>normal</em> to be a man with a job, and it was <em>normal</em> to be a woman who was a man&rsquo;s property. It was <em>normal</em> for children to be viewed as property of the parents, which (see previous point) meant the property of the man. It was <em>normal</em> to be straight and cis. It was <em>normal</em> to be able-bodied and employed. More importantly, though, these were the <em>only</em> normal things to be. To not be those things was to be abnormal, and to be abnormal was to be at the mercy of The Normal Ones.</p>
<p>Abuse—by those who were normal, of those who were not normal—used to be normal, and not ever acknowledging how all the most normal forms of abuse actually <em>were</em> abuse was most normal of all. It was perfectly normal to be racist, misogynist, a religious bigot, as a way of defending and maintaining normalcy, which was a way of defending who did and who did not have the right to make decisions about what identities would be permitted, and to what extent the permission would be allowed. So rape was normal, and bigotry was normal, and exclusion and threats and punishment and murder of those who committed the offense of trespassing the established boundaries of what ways of being human would be permitted by normal people was normal.</p>
<p>I fooled you. All of that is still normal. But increasingly, more and more of us are moving on from all that. We&rsquo;re done with it.</p>
<p>Imperfectly, to be sure, haltingly, no doubt. Sometimes it feels as if we&rsquo;ve been scaling a mountain face and only recently passed through some clouds, allowing us a view, previously obscured, of what lay above—and so the distance we&rsquo;ve come often only affords us a better view of how much further we have to climb. I know some would like to use the daunting climb looming above us to claim that we haven&rsquo;t climbed at all. But, if we are attentive and look downward long enough, we can see, peeking through the clouds, the vast prospect of rigid and supremacist normalcy we&rsquo;ve left behind. We can see all the ways of being a human that used to depend upon normalized bigotry for permission to exist but which now give themselves their own permission to exist, without seeking any other. We can see more and more identities that are now considered normal, and more and more of the abuse that once was granted as normal is now recognized, from loftier vantage, for the abnormal perversion it is.</p>

<p>Kelly was the CEO at Collins Aerospace (where I work) for several years prior to our merger with United Technologies back in 2018. I presented to him in meetings at least a few times when he was in a VP/GM role probably 11-12 years ago. Always thought he was a good guy.

			 <p><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781608336012">Making All Things New</a> is the most complete and succinct compilation of Delio’s theology and philosophy that I’ve encountered so far. She’s strongest in her call to bring our theology into alignment with modern cosmology, and in exploring how the human brain works and interacts with others. (Let’s not forget she’s got a PhD in pharmacology, after all, and was doing research on ALS or Parkinson’s or something.)</p>
<p>I still think she’s way too bought into Kurzweil’s singularity and transhumanism, but I’ll forgive her that because I think the rest of it is bang on. Very manageable at 200 pages.</p>

Opposing abusive logic and people is <em>equal to and commensurate with</em> the harm and indiscretion of abusive logic and people.  Both are considered &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; and this is because: supremacy systems are anxious systems, and anxious supremacy systems rely on the majority of people a- fawning, b- freezing, c- fleeing or d- fighting along with the supremacy ideology.</p>
<p>But facing that ideology and calling it &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; is a deep violation- a transgression- of how supremacy systems work. Because supremacy systems run on domination, control, conformity, submission, obedience, unquestioned authority.</p>
<p>I mention this all to say: I know that many who follow along and read my Facebook have also been labeled or called &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; for attempting to oppose injustice or advocate for yourself or call attention to abuse or speak out about wrongdoing. 
This is one artifact of supremacy systems: it&rsquo;s considered &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; and &lsquo;uncouth&rsquo; to explicitly, plainly, directly name and identify <em>specifically</em> abusive behavior.</p>
<p>But I want to say: opposing injustice isn&rsquo;t extreme, beloved. That&rsquo;s how love works. And i guess we could say that love <em>seems</em> extreme in systems that have chosen to run on logics other than love.</p>
<p>Take heart, good people. Love is the right kind of extreme to be when opposing injustice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matt has a gift for identifying and naming the systems that drive so much of our American lives. He&rsquo;s worth a follow.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/07/23/belatedly-catching-up.html">Belatedly catching up on Star Trek Discovery Season 5. What am I watching again?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/07/23/belatedly-catching-up.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-07-23 07:44:54 -0500">Jul 23, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We&rsquo;re way behind on TV watching, but last night Becky and I started in on <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>, Season 5. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed <em>Discovery</em> thus far, so of course we&rsquo;re gonna watch it through the final season. And while I still love the characters and want to see another season of story with them, I&rsquo;m not sure I love this format for a Star Trek series.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve recently been watching <em>Star Trek: Deep Space 9</em> for the first time and enjoying the long seasons full of individual episode stories, but the first two episodes of <em>Discovery</em> make clear that it&rsquo;s about a single story arc over the season. And the story and directing moves feel clunky and obvious. There&rsquo;s the need to re-introduce each of the characters while they narrate a little bit that you need to remember about their backstory. There&rsquo;s the whole &ldquo;get the band back together again&rdquo; trope that brings Tilly back to the Discovery crew. There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;one last job&rdquo; trope for Saru. (Also, I love Doug Jones, but feels like his makeup crew slipped here - I don&rsquo;t remember his teeth and lower lip being visible underneath the facial prosthetics in earlier seasons.) Episode 1 sets up the quest and gives us the lovable rogues who are ever so briefly positioned as villains before one of them is immediately revealed as Book&rsquo;s family&hellip; it&rsquo;s just too much.</p>
<p>Historically, Star Trek has kept most of its drama on ship or in very limited location shots because big cinematic production is expensive. With computer animation getting cheap, <em>Discovery</em> has moved a huge amount of the action onto planetary surfaces. Episode 2 has Burnham and two other characters riding high-speed speeders (a mash-up of a snowmobile, a jet ski, and a <em>Return of the Jedi</em>-style speeder bike) across a desert planet to escape an avalanche. It&rsquo;s really more Star Wars than Star Trek at that point. The desert village and market could just as easily be Mos Eisley as anywhere in a Star Trek universe.</p>
<p>And then there are the musical cues. I don&rsquo;t remember any previous Star Trek shows leaning so hard into orchestral scores. This is much more movie scoring than traditional TV scoring. And while composer Jeff Russo weaves hints of the Star Trek: The Next Generation theme motif in wherever possible to make clear that <em>this is Star Trek</em>, all the things he has the strings and horns doing make it clear he&rsquo;s been listening to John Williams' Star Wars sound tracks quite a lot.</p>
<p>In the end I&rsquo;m gonna watch it because dang it, it&rsquo;s Star Trek, but I&rsquo;m ready to go back and finish up DS9, where I can be sure that I&rsquo;m watching Trek and not some Star Wars universe show on Disney+.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have a small handful of theological books in my past that I look back on as turning points - books that spoke to me at my particular place and time, opened my eyes, and set my thinking about God in a new direction. The first of those is NT Wright’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3WePE1i"><em>Surprised By Hope</em></a>; the second is Ilia Delio’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4bPUjN4"><em>The Unbearable Wholeness of Being</em></a>. I’ll give it a week or two before I inscribe this in stone, but I’m inclined to think that Andrew Rillera’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4d3Nf08"><em>Lamb of the Free</em></a> is the next one. Let me try to explain.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the Protestant church (at least), there has been much ink spilled over the years to systematize <em>atonement theories</em>, that is, to organize all the teaching about Jesus’ death and how it works to save us into some sort of coherent, synthesized framework. In the conservative evangelical world of my first 40 years as a Christian, the predominant, nay, the <em>only</em> acceptable atonement theory is <em>penal substitutionary atonement</em>, usually abbreviated PSA. PSA says that each of us, as a sinner, deserve God’s punishment, but that Jesus died in our place, taking that wrath upon himself. The children’s bibles usually summarize it as “Jesus died so I don’t have to”.</p>
<p>Rillera says that PSA fails to pay attention to how sacrifices worked in the Old Testament, and as such then horribly misreads the New Testament (particularly Paul and Hebrews). This may be the book that inspires me to go back to where I always get bogged down in the Bible In A Year reading plans, and do a close reading of Leviticus.</p>
<p>Rillera starts right off the bat in chapter 1 by making the assertion that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as a substitutionary death sacrifice in the Torah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He notes that “for sins that called for capital punishment, of for the sinner to be “cut off”, there is no sacrifice that can be made to rectify the situation”, and that far from animal blood on the altar being a substitute for human blood, human blood actually <em>defiled</em> the altar rather than purifying it. Neither was that animal sacrifice about the animal suffering; to maltreat the animal “would be to render it ineligible to be offered to God”, no longer being “without blemish”. Already you can see the distinctions being drawn between this close reading of Levitical sacrifices and the usual broad arguments made in favor of PSA.</p>
<p><em>Lamb of the Free</em> takes 4 chapters - a full 150 pages - to review OT sacrifices. I’m not going to try to summarize it here. But I have a new understanding and appreciation for paying attention to those details now! Then in chapter 5 he turns the corner to talk about Jesus, and summarizes his arguments thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) According to the Gospels, Jesus’s life and ministry operated entirely consistent with and within OT purity laws and concern for the sanctuary.<br>
(2) Jesus was a source of contagious holiness that nullified the sources of the major ritual impurities as well as moral impurity.<br>
(3) Thus, Jesus was not anti-purity and he was not rejecting the temple <em>per se</em>.<br>
(4) Jesus’ appropriation of the prophetic critique of sacrifice fits entirely within the framework of the grave consequences of moral impurity. That is, like the prophets, Jesus is not critiquing sacrifice <em>per se</em>, but rather moral impurity, which will cause another exile and the destruction of the sanctuary.<br>
(5) But, his followers will be able to experience the moral purification he offers.<br>
(6)The only sacrificial interpretation of Jesus’s death that is attributed to Jesus himself occurs at the Lord’s Supper. At this meal Jesus combines two communal well-being sacrifices… to explain the importance of his death. However, the notion of <em>kipper</em> [atonement] is not used in any of these accounts…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot there, and Rillera unpacks it through the second half of the book. (I was particularly enthusiastic at his point (2), as it dovetails neatly with Richard Beck’s <a href="https://amzn.to/4bPgsLp"><em>Unclean</em></a>, where Beck argues that Jesus’ holiness was of such a quality that indeed, sin didn’t stick to him, but rather his holiness “stuck to”, and purified, other people’s sin and sickness.) Rillera says that Jesus’ death conquered death because even death was transformed by Jesus’ touch, and that Jesus came and died not as a substitution but rather as a peace offering from God to humankind. (His unpacking of Romans 3:25-26 and the word <em>hilastērion</em> was particularly wonderful here.) Jesus’ suffering under sin and death was <em>in solidarity</em> with humankind, and uniquely served to ultimately <em>purify</em> humankind from death and sin.  (Really, I’m trying to write a single blog post here and summarize a 300 page book. If you’ve gotten this far and you’re still interested, <a href="https://amzn.to/4d3Nf08">go buy the book</a> and read it. If you want to read it but it’s too pricy for you, let me know and I’ll send you a copy. I’m serious.)</p>
<p>I’ll wrap this up with a beautiful paragraph from a chapter near the end titled “When Jesus’s Death is Not a Sacrifice”. In examining 1 Peter 2, Rillera says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First Peter says that Jesus dies as an “example so that you should follow his steps”. In short, Jesus’s death is a participatory reality; it is something we are called to follow and share in experientially ourselves. The logic is not: Jesus died so I don’t have to. It is: Jesus died (redeeming us from slavery and forming us into a kingdom of priests in 2:5, 9) so that we, together, can follow in his steps and die <em>with</em> him and <em>like</em> him; the just for the unjust (3:18) and trusting in a God who judges justly (2:23; 4:19). This is what it means to “suffer…for being a ‘Christian’” (4:15-16). It does not particularly matter <em>why</em> a Christ-follower is suffering or being persecuted; it only matters <em>that</em> they bear the injustice of the world in a <em>Christ-like</em>, and therefore, a <em>Servant-like</em> manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a dozen other bits I’d love to share - maybe in another post soon. But for now, I’m thankful for Andrew Remington Rillera and his wonderful work in <em>Lamb of the Free</em>. I’ll be thinking about this for a long time.</p>

			 <p>A month or so ago I ordered <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/tuxedo-cat-21349">a Lego set</a> that my kid fell in love with. It was super-popular and backordered, so I paid for it via Apple Pay and figured it’d show up when it showed up. (Having a Christmas present bought early isn’t a bad thing!)</p>
<p>While I was gone on a trip, I got the shipping email from Lego, and by the time I got home the package had indeed arrived. (Lego cat is now built, and will probably end up going to college with the kid. They love it.)</p>
<p>Yesterday I got an email from Lego with my invoice that said that my payment mechanism had failed, and to please contact them at their 1-800 number to resolve the payment difficulty. The email looks legit. The 800 number they list is the US customer service number that is listed on the Lego website. I checked my credit card bill and indeed, I’ve never been billed for it. A quick online search reveals that this has happened to other people and was indeed legit. So all in all, I think the request is legitimate.</p>
<p>Best I can guess, Lego validated the Apple Pay payment at the time I made the order, but then by the time the order shipped and they actually tried to charge it, Apple Pay had expired that number. OK, I can call Lego and give them payment information. Mostly I’m amazed that Lego shipped me a $100 order without confirming first that my payment went through. Who in the world does that these days? Real customer service! Guess I’ll take it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A small bombshell dropped in the Neo-Reformed evangelical world with <a href="https://www.sacredwilderness.org/post/bbtb-ep-77-whistleblowers-the-village-church-denton-w--anna-chris-show-notes">today’s episode of the <em>The Bodies Behind the Bus Podcast</em> (BBTBPOD)</a>. <em>BBTBPOD</em>, which centers stories of those harmed by abusive evangelical church situations, today released an interview with a former chair of the elder board at The Village Church (TVC) in Denton, Texas, originally a campus and then a full plant from The Village Church in Flower Mound, Texas, pastored by Matt Chandler. Chandler is a big name in the Neo-Reformed world. His sermon audio has been very popular; he took over leadership of the Acts 29 church planting network when Mark Driscoll got out of hand, and has authored numerous books.</p>
<p>Today on <em>BBTBPOD</em>, former TVC Denton elder chair Chris revealed that in 2007, leaders from TVC hired Steve Chandler, Pastor Matt’s father, to work as a custodian at the Denton campus, knowing full well that Steve had a history that included confessed child sexual abuse. This history was not made known to Steve’s supervisor or the staff of the Denton campus until 2009, at which point “safety standards and protocols” were put in place. Steve worked in that role, with full access to the building at all times, until 2012. It was not until 2019 that this information was revealed to TVC membership at a members’ meeting. The statement given to the church at that members’ meeting largely lionized Steve, praising him for “steward[ing] his testimony for the edification of the church”. Steve was reportedly given a standing ovation by the membership at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>That TVC would hire a known child sexual abuser is horrifying. That they would not inform that person’s direct supervisor or insist that safety protocols were immediately in place is, at best, wildly irresponsible. That when it finally came to light, the statement presented to the church served to lionize the offender and ignore the victim is tragic and infuriating. That all this would be done to provide employment for the father of the celebrity lead pastor is awful. That the church leadership would handle it that way <em>in 2019</em>, in the midst of all the other sex abuse scandals churning under the surface in the Southern Baptist Convention (later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/12/southern-baptist-church-sexual-abuse-scandal">coming to light in 2022</a>) is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Why am I writing about this here? While I’ve been out of the evangelical church for 4 years now, I spent most of my adult life in it. I was a Driscoll fanboy for a long while, and when he clearly got out of hand, I became a Chandler fanboy. <a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/28/some-thoughts-on.html">I wrote positively about it</a> when Chandler took over the reins of Acts 29 back in 2012. I have friends who have been members of TVC. So I write this with some feeling of responsibility both to own up to my own responsibility, and to sound the warning to any who still might hear me and read this far.</p>
<p>The Village Church is not a safe place. Its leadership has demonstrated through <a href="https://noedenelsewhere.com/does-the-village-church-have-a-domestic-abuse-problem/">several</a> <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/man-confesses-to-child-porn-church-disciplines-his-wife/">well-documented</a> <a href="https://noedenelsewhere.com/swinging-pastors-former-village-church-satellite-rocked-by-allegations-concerning-its-former-pastor/">cases</a> that it cannot be trusted to responsibly handle instances of sexual abuse and misconduct.   Matt Chandler himself <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article269614736.html">took a leave of absence in 2022</a> for vaguely-specified misconduct involving “frequent, inappropriate messages” with a woman not his wife. At each instance TVC’s first move has been to protect the church’s reputation rather than to protect the victim. I am personally convinced there is a direct line that can be drawn between the determinist and patriarchal theology that TVC, Acts 29, and similar Neo-Reformed churches teach and their awful handling of abuse. These churches do not deserve our support or our participation. Those who love Jesus should be praying for the truth to come to light, for justice for the criminals, and healing for the victims.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple posts came through my inbox while I was traveling the last few days which I want to pass on and feel like they have some parallels:</p>
<p><a href="https://katelynbeaty.substack.com/p/trust-your-heart-gut-intuition-emotions"><strong>Katelyn Beaty asks &ldquo;What if you can trust your heart?&quot;</strong></a></p>
<p>I have written before about evangelicals' love for <a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2023/07/04/playing-the-jeremiah.html">playing the Jeremiah 17:9 card</a>. This tactic is regularly used to push people into submission to their leaders' arguments even when their internal compass says something isn&rsquo;t right. Beaty calls out this unease with feelings so prevalent in Reformed evangelicalism, and says we need to pay attention to our whole selves, our gut instinct as well as our rational thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;I’ve only grown in the belief that <strong>our gut is always speaking and deserves to be listened to</strong>. “Gut intuition” is distinct from emotions more broadly. But both are pre-rational, something we feel in our bodies before we have the words to articulate them. And I wonder if that’s why a lot of the evangelical world has trouble honoring them: we’ve inherited a mind-body dualism that says that mind is good and the body is bad. And, of course, that the body is the realm of women: messy, “irrational,” “crazy,” prone to quick changes and fluctuations, etc. This is all Plato, not Jesus, folks&hellip;</p>
<p>I can’t tell you the number of stories I’ve heard that someone’s “off” feeling about a person, place, or institution proved to be disastrously true, that they should have spoken up sooner but stuffed their feelings in the name of loyalty to a leader or cause. And I wonder if we’d have fewer church scandals if Christians honored intuition as a worthy source of truth — even as a place where the Holy Spirit is speaking to or through us, if only we would listen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think she&rsquo;s onto something there.</p>
<p>Second is <a href="https://heretichereafter.substack.com/p/christianity-vs-therapy"><strong>Katharine Strange&rsquo;s post on &lsquo;Christianity vs. Therapy&rsquo;</strong></a>. In reviewing Anna Gazmarian’s <em>Devout: A Memoir of Doubt</em>, Strange discusses evangelicalism&rsquo;s long-standing beef with psychology and therapists. Many evangelical churches are strong on Biblical Counseling, a movement which trains laypeople to exclusively use Scripture to counsel people, a movement which is strongly antagonistic to professional psychotherapy. (Oh, do I have thoughts on this. But I&rsquo;ll save them for another post.)</p>
<p>Strange pulls at another thread in suggesting why evangelicalism is so opposed to therapy, and it resonates with my own experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think a large part of the problem boils down to the way that Christianity is “sold” in this country. As <a href="https://medium.com/@katharinestrange/the-evangelical-pyramid-scheme-dcf9d3d22516">I’ve written about before</a>, there’s so much pressure to convert our friends and neighbors that what we often end up presenting to the world is a kind of “prosperity gospel lite”—Jesus as cure-all. Being both Christian AND a person with problems is bad for the brand.</p>
<p>This “multi-level marketing” version of Christianity leads to a religion that values a mask of perfection over authenticity. Belonging, in this case, means cutting off parts of ourselves, whether that’s our sexuality/gender expression, our personal struggles, or even the fact that we experience basic feelings like sadness, irritation, envy, etc. It’s toxic positivity as a ticket to sainthood. Churches that buy into this methodology create lonely people even in the midst of community (for what is belonging without authenticity?) They also have a tendency to thrust narcissistic and authoritarian types into leadership because these are precisely the kind of people who are best at never letting the mask slip. Such environments can easily erupt into abuse, religious trauma, perfectionism, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrupulosity">scrupulosity</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I knew MLMs were largely fueled and run by religious people, I hadn&rsquo;t ever really thought about the idea that evangelicalism is essentially selling Christianity <em>as</em> a sort of MLM, by MLM principles. Now I can&rsquo;t unsee it.</p>

			 <p>I looked at the calendar today and it said July, and I thought <em>surely that has to be a mistake</em>. July already? Where has the time gone? Then I reviewed. Since the beginning of May, here&rsquo;s what my weeks have looked like:</p>
<ul>
<li>NHD State Competition in Des Moines + one day work offsite</li>
<li>Two days of work travel to Minnesota</li>
<li>Three days of work travel to DC</li>
<li>Three days of vacation for HS graduation activities</li>
<li>Memorial Day holiday week</li>
<li>Three day work offsite</li>
<li>Full week of vacation - NHD nationals in DC</li>
<li>Half week of vacation - DC trip</li>
<li>Full week in the office (finally!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now this week is a holiday-shortened work week and then I&rsquo;m gonna be out of office Monday/Tuesday next week for college orientation in Nebraska. Then I have five, count &lsquo;em, five regular summer work weeks before taking Anwyn to college for move-in. Then high school starts for Katie, we&rsquo;re down to just one kid in the house (oof) and it&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>I am not ready for this.</p>

<p>Grandma gets scammed, and decides to take matters into her own hands. It’s a delightful movie. Moves briskly, treats its characters respectfully, is both heartwarming and hilarious. June Squibb turned 93 while making this film, and she uses that age and experience to great effect here. Richard Roundtree co-stars and their chemistry is just perfect.</p>
<p>Grab a loved one, go see <em>Thelma</em>, and prepare for a fun 100 minutes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Richard Beck <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/06/a-theology-of-petitionary-prayer-part-2.html">has a post this week</a> addressing &ldquo;intellectual problems with petitionary prayer&rdquo;, or to put the question another way: how does prayer &ldquo;work&rdquo;? He critiques a vision of God sitting at a distance from the world and being convinced to reach in and intervene in a Creation that otherwise ticks on autonomously. He calls this the &ldquo;magic domino theory&rdquo; - the idea that prayer is to get God to reach in and tip over the magic domino that knocks over other dominos to make things happen.</p>
<p>Beck&rsquo;s latest book, as I understand it (having read his posts about it but not the book itself) argues for a re-enchanted view of the world. In this post he builds off of Gerard Manley Hopkins' line that &ldquo;the world is charged with the grandeur of God&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God isn&rsquo;t at a distance. God&rsquo;s energy and power suffuses creation. Creation isn&rsquo;t ticking along autonomously, like a machine. Creation is alive and exists in an on-going radical dependence upon God. We are continuously bathed in God&rsquo;s sustaining light and love, and should God ever look away from us we would cease to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I love this, but I am also internally screaming &ldquo;but what does this really MEAN?&rdquo; After a lifetime in fundamentalist evangelicalism being told to accept a broad disconnect between the reality of creation and the &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; of God in it, I need something more tangible.</p>
<p>This is where I appreciate being able to read <a href="https://chrishubbs.com/categories/ilia-delio/">Ilia Delio</a> alongside Beck. Delio, I think, would agree with Beck&rsquo;s vision of creation being imbued with God&rsquo;s presence. But she would then start to talk about what that permeation might actually mean at a level of quantum mechanics. And this is so helpful to me because even though, to adapt Arthur C. Clarke, sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, I need to at least conceptually be able to ground that &ldquo;magic&rdquo; (or to use Beck&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;enchanted&rdquo;) view of God&rsquo;s interaction with creation in the real, scientific world somehow.</p>
<p>And even though my understanding of quantum physics is quite limited, Delio&rsquo;s push to bring theology into discussion with modern cosmology has been a key to my ability to stay within the stream of Christianity. I couldn&rsquo;t deal any more with the disconnected, capricious, judgmental God that evangelicalism gave me. But that we could personify &ldquo;God&rdquo; as a conceptualization of the mysterious relational charge running through the fabric of the universe? That somehow uniquely enlightened and enlivened Jesus of Nazareth? That&rsquo;s an approach that can unite my head and my heart as I (like everyone else) try to grapple with the mysteries of life.</p>

			 <p>Quick recommendations for a couple things I&rsquo;ve read lately that are worth a few minutes of your time:</p>
<p>Diana Butler Bass&rsquo;s most recent newsletter essay <a href="https://dianabutlerbass.substack.com/p/on-statues-history-politics-and-division">On Statues, History, Politics, and Division</a>. In discussing the removal of Confederate statues across the South, she hits on a resonant phrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not long after the Richmond bronzes and marbles had been removed, I was in the city speaking at a church. The pastor, a religious leader who agreed with their removal, asked me: “Have you driven down Monument Avenue yet?”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, “I’ve haven’t been there recently.”</p>
<p>“It is stark, emotionally powerful in a different way,” he said. “You look down the road and the statues are all gone. There are empty altars everywhere.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Empty altars everywhere.</strong> That captures the spirit of the age, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Second: Andrew Osenga&rsquo;s latest, <a href="https://andrewosenga.substack.com/p/american-christianity-is-a-cybertruck">American Christianity is a CyberTruck</a>. He looks at <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/texas-megachurch-pastor-robert-morris-resigns-after-woman-111233220">the sad scandal of Robert Morris</a> and some online discussion of a modern worship song that says &ldquo;praise is the water my enemies drown in&rdquo; and pulls the threads together this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commercialization of Christian culture has led us to sacrifice wisdom for influence, and thus we are losing both.</p>
<p>These songs and leaders (and books and conferences, etc etc) might get us where we want to go - a big church, a #1 single, a senate seat - but to anybody outside our little circle, it just looks ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>They don’t take our faith seriously, because we have not taken our faith seriously.</strong></p>
<p>The CyberTruck might get you to Target, but people are going to roll their eyes when you get there.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of car Jesus would drive, but I do know that He has asked me to love my enemies, to pray for those who persecute me, to give what I can to the poor, and to pick up my cross and follow Him.</p>
<p>What if the world saw a young pastor turn himself in for his sexual abuse, offer his guilty plea, do his jail time and then live the rest of his life quietly doing good and serving others? What fruit might grow from that true repentance?</p>
<p>What if, rather than weapons or drowning, our big sing-along songs were about loving those who persecute us? How might that change the nature of our cultural conversations?</p>
<p>In many ways it feels like the sun is setting on a particular era of American Christian empire. Its leaders are crumbling like pillars of sand and the institutions feel like empty shopping malls.</p>
<p>In the grief and pain of so much damage, may our tears water new fruits of kindness and humility, thoughtfulness and wisdom. The world doesn’t need Jesus-brand products, it needs to see Jesus in our eyes, hear Him in our language, and feel Him in our actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and amen.</p>

			 <p>I just finished up a slow read of a wonderful little book. <a href="https://amzn.to/3z3q6fE"><em>A Window to the Divine: Creation Theology</em></a> by Franciscan theologian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Hayes">Zachary Hayes</a> draws from Teilhard and Whitehead to suggest that we need to recognize that our approach to synthesizing modern science and creation theology needs some updating. As he notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the worldview mediated to both believer and unbeliever alike by our modern culture is radically different from that which provided some key structural elements for our familiar theological vision and language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, he asks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If scientific or prescientific views of the world inter into the structure of a theology in some way, and if believers forget where a style of theology has come from and what elements have entered into its structure, what would one expect to happen when the scientific vision of the world begins to change?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first chapter, Hayes examines the relationship between theology and science, noting that they exist to answer very different sorts of questions. They need not exist in opposition to each other, he says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;we will not expect science to prove faith claims, nor will we expect theology to prove the claims of science. But we will attempt to allow religious faith to express itself in terms relevant to its cultural context, which, at least in the Western world of the present, is strongly conditioned by scientific insights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hayes goes on to briefly examine the creation texts, suggesting a theological interpretation of the beginning of Genesis that is focused far more on God as the source and origin of creation rather than on a scientific explanation of <em>how</em> things came into being. He takes a chapter to discuss the origin of humans (all from Adam? or from multiple parents?) and how that view interacts with Romans 5. (As in Adam all sinned, so in Christ all will be saved&hellip;) Hayes suggests that these texts, too, should be read <em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etiology">etiologically</a></em>, that is, as discussing the <em>cause</em> or <em>origin</em> of sin and salvation, not of some literal genetic propagation of sinfulness. He bogs down a bit in a very Roman Catholic discussion of Original Sin, trying to briefly address both Augustine and the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>The last chapter, though, is worth the whole read, as he pulls the threads together. I will quote more liberally here, it&rsquo;s just too good.</p>
<p>First, about sin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human history is a history of response, both negative and positive, to the lure of God&rsquo;s love&hellip;  Sin is not a mere infringement of a law extrinsic to our nature. It is a failure to realize the potential of our nature itself. If our nature is fundamentally a potential to expand, sin is a contraction&hellip; Sin is the resistance to expansion through union with others. It is the attempt to create human history in alienation from the only end that we ultimately have&hellip; Sin is a failure in the collaborative effort to move toward full personalization in human community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then regarding grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The history of God&rsquo;s grace and human response finds a distinctive form of self-consciousness in the history of the Bible, and an unsurpassed level of realization in the person and destiny of Jesus Christ&hellip; God, who is love community, calls forth love community in creation through free response of human persons to the offer of divine grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, finally, about the relation of theology and science, and why it matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theology need not fear science nor tremble before the power of reason. Rather both theology and science need to stand in awe in the face of the mystery that is our world and in the even greater mystery of God to which the world points&hellip;</p>
<p>We have no reason to assume that the mere fact of human life is the goal of the universe. What is important above all is a quality of life, not the mere fact of life. With this in mind, we can see that it is a more significant question to ask whether this sort of world is apt for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose. It is, indeed, a cosmos that challenges humanity in mind and in will, and that is capable of eliciting both awe and wonder. It is a cosmos that draws humanity out of the narrow point from which it begins to expand to the mystery of the world and thus to move towards the Ground of the world. It is a world apt to stretch the finite spirit to the limits of its possibility to bring forth not only the fact of life, but a Godlike quality of life that is a created sharing in the loving thought of God from which the whole of creation emerges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beautiful stuff.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m always a little hesitant to write about traveling while we&rsquo;re still out on the trip, since it does put out there in public that our house is empty (even if we have people coming over multiple times a day to care for pets). But now that we&rsquo;re back home, it&rsquo;s worth a review of the past 9 days.</p>
<p><strong>National History Day National Competition</strong><br>
Our youngest daughter, Katie, just finished her first year of high school. For the second year she competed in <a href="https://nhd.org/en/">National History Day</a>, where she researched a historical topic (this year: the codebreakers of Bletchley Park) and wrote and performed a 10-minute monologue on the topic. She took second at state this year, which qualified her for nationals. So, we took Katie and Anwyn to the DC area for the contest. (Laura is in Nebraska for the summer, working&hellip; we missed her!)</p>
<p>NHD nationals are hosted at the University of Maryland. We stayed in the dorms there for 4 nights, from which I draw two observations: 1) cafeteria food has improved a lot since I went to college; 2) I&rsquo;m too old for dorm living. The days that Katie wasn&rsquo;t competing we took the Metro down into DC and played tourist. I think the Museum of Natural History got the highest praise from our crew, though Katie was very excited to go to the International Spy Museum and see actual Enigma and Lorenz encoders after having researched them all year!</p>
<p>Katie&rsquo;s performance went very well, but she didn&rsquo;t make it into the top 10 to perform again in the finals. We opted out of the 4-hour award ceremony (so many categories! so many medals to hand out!) and headed down to Georgetown where she had a college visit scheduled. Three years ahead isn&rsquo;t <em>too</em> early to start planning, I guess. The G&rsquo;town campus is beautiful. Katie knows she&rsquo;s gonna have to work hard if she wants to be able to make it into a school like that. I am confident that she will.</p>

<p><strong>New York City</strong><br>
Friday morning we got in our rental car and drove up to Manhattan. I&rsquo;m the only one of the family that had been to NYC before, so we decided a long weekend would be a good time. And it was. We visited museums and memorials, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, did some shopping, ate too much good food, and one night Becky and I made a late night (for us old folks!) outing to the <a href="https://www.bluenotejazz.com/nyc/">Blue Note</a> to see Wynton Marsalis and his Future of Jazz Septet play. They were fantastic. We spent Sunday hanging out with some friends who came up from New Jersey, and had a great time wandering around Midtown and Central Park.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Monday morning I woke up to a notification that our 5pm flight out of LaGuardia was already delayed an hour. Thankfully I was able to get us rebooked on a flight that left a little earlier, took a more direct route home, and got us home an hour earlier than scheduled (and 2 hours earlier than we would have on the delayed flights!). It is very good to be home. Becky did the math and reported we walked more than 50 miles over the past nine days&hellip; there&rsquo;s a reason my feet are sore. But it was a delightful family trip, and I&rsquo;m very glad we were able to make it work this year.</p>

			 <p>Man, Rick Pidcock has become a must-read. <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/rosaria-butterfield-is-not-a-model-for-becoming-un-gay/">His piece this morning on Rosaria Butterfield&rsquo;s trajectory into anti-LGBTQ hate</a> is really something. She&rsquo;s one of those people that was lionized at my old evangelical church after she hit the scene - the perfect &ldquo;ex-gay&rdquo; story for them to hold up. She still spoke kindly about gay people in the church, even though she loudly said they were wrong. But no more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice the shift in Butterfield’s language over time. She goes from considering Side B Christians as “faithful brothers and sisters” to calling them heretics. She goes from promoting hospitality toward LGBTQ people to promoting hostility, even referring to the conversation as a “war.” She goes from extending mercy to LGBTQ people to cutting off mercy due to thinking God was less merciful than she was. She excuses homophobia. She embraces conversion therapy despite its ineffectiveness and the harm it causes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>Rick&rsquo;s conclusion is spot-on, though. While evangelicals warn about a &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; of LGBTQ tolerance leading to full acceptance and embrace, they don&rsquo;t recognize the slope they themselves are on: from dismissal and dehumanization to full-on hatred and violence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So yes, once you begin interpreting the Bible through a lens of love and wholeness, there can be a slippery slope toward accepting LGBTQ people because planting seeds of love and wholeness will produce the fruit of more love and wholeness.</p>
<p>But there’s also a slippery slope on the other side. And planting seeds that cause the violence of disembodiment and dehumanization will produce the fruit of more disembodiment and dehumanization. The question we must face this Pride month is toward which fruit we want to slide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose love, my friends. Love wins.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A milestone snuck up on me this weekend: as of June 1st I have been working at Collins Aerospace for 25 years. In 1999, fresh out of college with a CS degree, I moved to the Midwest to take a position in an industry that I knew almost nothing about. Still, a job was a job, and this Nebraska boy was ready to be done living in Texas. 25 years later, the name on the door has changed a few times, but many of the faces have stayed the same.</p>
<p>I started as a software engineer for flight management systems. Two weeks later, I got loaned out to our flight displays department, and FMS never got me back. After ten years doing software development, I got interested in airworthiness certification. Got my FAA DER ticket and for the next 13 years I worked full time in our certification group. For the past two years I’ve worked in Advanced Technology, trying to apply the lessons I learned from all my time doing compliance finding to help us do better, easier work during the design cycle.</p>
<p>I know I’m a little bit of an anomaly for my generation to be so long with the same employer. One of the advantages of working for a large organization is that at whatever point I’ve gotten bored in my current position, there’s been a new position I could move into, and the learning could start again. On the whole, I keep enjoying the job, and they keep paying me, so 25 years later I’m quite happy and thankful to still be here. I’d say “here’s to another 25 years”, but I sure hope I’ve retired before then.</p>

			 <p>So Trump was convicted of 34 felonies. This morning I have a distant cousin on Facebook last night complaining about how broken the justice system is. And this morning he&rsquo;s calling for another Civil War. I&rsquo;m just not sure how to bridge this reality gap.</p>
<p>First off, as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/matttebbe/posts/pfbid02cnghQn7PVpg7zSqncNbCRPXAt6BdcdEb1bfgkJNvPjmmeHc8TuyuxzHGRFUwUP2Wl?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZWt2Aj1lhP9wa-V6aCKcwSmz8H8qWSiMpCCgWVQFdZX4Duj4ZMth26IR7CA0V-YvIixrRSXYDiB4iaTwr3enEJM1byEMrXZrNXIkD-JIMcDMs2Tro9ETLGlURrEJvesm48uot_WzD0alUOBiAqsNTL6&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R">Matt Tebbe so brilliantly put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not a miscarriage of justice when<br>
a Black man is choked out in the street<br>
Or a Black woman is killed in her bed<br>
Or a Black man is gunned down running while Black<br>
But it is when a white millionaire is convicted of many felonies.<br>
This is how whiteness works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That cousin surely didn&rsquo;t make a lot of noise about the broken justice system after George Floyd was killed, or Breanna Taylor was killed, or Trayvon Martin was killed&hellip; I wonder why now?</p>
<p>And secondly, is that cousin really ready to take up his guns and kill people like me because we disagree politically? And because I think maybe the justice system did its job here?</p>
<p>Now I know it&rsquo;s far easier to grumble on Facebook than it is to do actual work, and I&rsquo;m willing to bet at this point I&rsquo;ve been to more political protests in the last 5 years than he has. But I do wonder how we ever bridge the gap here. Are things so irreparably broken that chaos is inevitable? I fear so, but I hope not.</p>

<p>Kaplan writes the history of bop, free jazz, and fusion through the lives of Davis, Coltrane, and Bill Evans. Wonderfully written, but such a tragic story of troubled, addicted men who somehow made such amazing music.</p>

<li>I&rsquo;m gonna be back in the saddle, er, on the bench as a church musician the next couple weeks. Looking forward to it.</li>
<li>Pretty dang excited for the concert tickets I bought this week. More on that later.</li>
<li>Next week I&rsquo;m out of office for 3 days for Anwyn&rsquo;s high school graduation.</li>
<li>This means that by next week at this time we&rsquo;ll have 2 of our 3 kids out of high school. When did we get old?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been helping pick out the hymns for our church services for the past several months, which has been a good way to learn the Episcopal hymnal and also to pick out songs I enjoy singing. Is that self-serving?</li>
<li>Obviously I mean that <em>I</em> got old but my beautiful wife is as young and lovely as ever.</li>

			 <p>Sam Thielman goes hard in his most recent piece at Forever Wars titled <a href="https://www.forever-wars.com/what-could-be-more-radicalizing-than-an-nypd-columbia-education/">“What Could Be More Radicalizing Than An NYPD-Columbia Education?”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eric Adams, the ex-NYPD mayor of New York City —who, in keeping with the grand traditions of his old job, probably doesn’t even live in New York—cares deeply about our children. We know this because he told us so. &ldquo;These are our children,&rdquo; he told Katty Kay on MSNBC, &ldquo;and we can’t allow them to be radicalized like children are being radicalized across the globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is important to Eric Adams that children learn the right lesson at the right time. And so, on the campus of Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prizes will be awarded today, he deployed platoons of his former colleagues to administer the kind of education New York City’s ruling class prefers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth reading the whole thing. (As is true any time Sam is writing.)</p>
<p>It is amazing to me the level of over-reaction from School Administration and the NYPD, who clearly wanted an excuse to display their power. Fascim, folks. It’s real. It’s not coming; it’s here already.</p>

			 <p>On a beautiful Sunday morning, I slept in (until 8).</p>
<p>Kicked off the coffeemaker to brew my locally-roasted beans.</p>
<p>Played Wordle. (Got it in 4.)</p>
<p>Read through my email newsletters for the morning. Realized I was long overdue to support <a href="https://armoxon.substack.com">A.R. Moxon</a>. Clicked the link and started a monthly donation. By my count, the 5th recovering homeschooled or super-conservative Christian-schooled evangelical-kid-turned-writer I’m supporting. It’s a whole genre.</p>
<p>Made breakfast. Drank coffee. Started reading a book on social science.</p>
<p>I’m now a member of a church where you don’t have to show up at the crack of dawn and stay all morning to prove your devotion to the cause. My wife and kids aren’t going this morning. (My kids don’t usually. My wife has other plans today.) I’ll show up this morning for the 10:15 service and do my part by getting up to read the OT and Psalm. I’ll be home by 11:30.  (The Episcopal Church: Where You Can Love Jesus <em>and</em> Your Trans Kid. ™)</p>
<p>After church I’ll probably hit the neighborhood farmer’s market. (First market of the year today!)</p>
<p>Still evangelical enough that there’s a verse in my head to summarize my morning thoughts:</p>
<p>“When the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was an instant supporter of this album on Kickstarter and now I&rsquo;m finally getting a chance to listen to it: Jennifer Knapp&rsquo;s <em>Kansas 25</em>. Back when <em>Kansas</em> came out in 1998, college me was totally drawn in. Smart lyrics, catchy tunes, and a raw honesty that I didn&rsquo;t hear in a lot of the other Christian music that was on the radio and for sale in the bookstore. I memorized the songs, sang them on my guitar, sang one of them in church, and spun that CD all the time in the car. I have often mentioned it as one of the three &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; Christian music albums ever. It&rsquo;s that good.</p>
<p>Knapp, now 50, has been on a long road since releasing the original <em>Kansas</em> in her early twenties. She moved to Australia in 2002, publicly came out as a lesbian in 2010, recorded some other albums, and became an outspoken advocate for LGBT causes. There&rsquo;s something incredibly meaningful about hearing her revisit these faith-filled songs in middle age. The miles have taken their toll - the voice is a little more raspy, the tempos a little slower - but the youthful expressions of faith still ring true all these years later.</p>
<p>If you supported the Kickstarter, you probably already have the download. (If not, find it in your inbox!) If you didn&rsquo;t get in early, head over to <a href="https://jenniferknappmusic.bandcamp.com/album/kansas-25">Bandcamp</a> where you can preorder it and listen as soon as it officially releases on May 17.</p>

Moxon has a brilliant and brutal essay out today entitled <a href="https://www.the-reframe.com/war-or-nothing/">“War or Nothing”</a>, in which he describes a theme beginning in 2001 with the US’s response to the 9/11 attacks and continues all the way through 2020’s George Floyd protests and this year’s pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. From it he describes “seven laws of living in a war-oriented society”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Killing is not only <em>an</em> appropriate answer to killing, it is <em>the only</em> appropriate answer.</li>
<li>The worst betrayal possible is any opposition to killing.</li>
<li>The only appropriate answer to killing is not only killing—it must be disproportionate killing.</li>
<li>Any hypothetical future threat of potential attack justifies the same disproportionate violent response as an actual attack.</li>
<li>Any killing we do, not matter how indefensible it is, can only ever be self-defense.</li>
<li>Wanting to wage war makes you correct in a way that overcomes evidence or results or even coherence.</li>
<li>Killing is the only thing that will keep us safe from killing. Therefore, anyone who opposes killing represents a threat justifying further killing.</li>
</ul>
<p>He’s not wrong. A taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And millions of us, who have been watching since 2001 or even before, can see how framing the apparatus of killing as indistinguishable from safety helps the apparatus of killing, but not how it helps make us safe. We can see how framing a country as indistinguishable from its murderous government helps that government, but not how it helps the country. We can see how framing all a county&rsquo;s citizens as indistinguishable from its murderous government helps that government, but not how it helps the people. And we can see clearly how framing killing as the only way to bring safety, and any act other than killing as nothing favors those who want to see a world of death, but not how it helps honor the dead or keeps any of the living safe.</p>
<p>Millions of us think the bigger problem might be the killing. It seems to us war as the only option represents the greatest possible failure of human imagination there can be, and our wealth and resources and ingenuity seem to present many other options. Perhaps if we put our heads together, we might think of something else to do, that isn&rsquo;t nothing but isn&rsquo;t war, either. And even if many of us are foolish and ignorant about what that something might be, we think that seeking that something is better than not seeking it. And even if many of us are foolish and ignorant, many of us are not, and even those of us who are ignorant fools can see the way the suggestions and solutions presented by those who are not ignorant fools are ignored while those of us who are the most ignorant and the most foolish receive the most attention from our institutions of influence and power, to frame this whole act of imagination as ignorant and foolish.</p>
<p>And even those of us who are ignorant fools can see how this helps promote the ideal of war or nothing, but we don&rsquo;t see how it helps us find something that is not killing but isn&rsquo;t nothing, either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God grant us leaders brave enough to consider responses to killing that aren’t more killing, but aren’t nothing, either.</p>

			 <p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from Robinson writing on Genesis, but I enjoy her writing enough it was definitely something I was going to read. Structured as a narrative commentary, Robinson doesn’t employ chapter breaks or other touchpoints within the text itself. It’s fascinating to read a commentary by a Christian writer who takes the text seriously but not necessarily literally. If there is a broad “point” to her book, it is to feature the uniqueness of Genesis among the Ancient Near Eastern texts, and to highlight the theme of unmerited grace that runs through it. From God’s forgiveness of Cain to Joseph’s forgiveness of his brothers, Robinson tells us that Genesis is set apart from the other ANE texts this way.</p>
<p>I appreciated her book, but didn’t enjoy it as much as reading her essays. I need to pick them up for a re-read.</p>

<p>I think it may take the American evangelical church another decade or so to really realize how closely intertwined they are with the Republican party, but my prayer is that the realization hits sooner rather than later. What compounds the issue is that our view of American exceptionalism makes us prideful enough that we are resistant to learn from our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world on the topic.</p>

<p>Little did I expect that, a decade later, the evangelical church would, see it, realize it, and <em>embrace it</em>. God help us.</p>

			 <p>Well, this is a fascinating perspective: medievalist Dr. Eleanor Johnson <a href="https://lithub.com/what-medieval-poets-can-teach-us-about-climate-change-and-what-evangelicals-today-get-wrong/">writes on Literary Hub</a> about medieval Christians' view on climate change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming</em> opens by saying, “We believe the Earth and its ecosystems—created by God’s intelligent design and infinite power and sustained by His faithful providence—are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting, admirably suited for human flourishing.”</p>
<p>As a scholar of medieval religion, culture, and literature, I am utterly perplexed by this belief, because I study a period and region of history where people were, if anything <em>more</em> devoutly and observantly Christian, and I’m here to tell you: medieval English people had <em>no</em> problem believing in climate change and ecosystemic collapse.</p>
<p>Like contemporary Christians, medieval Christians did believe in a providential God. They also believed Nature’s functionality was guaranteed by His will. But they did <em>not</em> believe that, since Nature was underwritten by divine will, Nature would automatically take care of them.</p>
<p>Instead, they assumed that climate change and ecological disasters were divine punishment for human malfeasance. They believed this, first, because they were living through the Little Ice Age, and everyone could feel its effects; nobody bothered to deny it, because it was <em>obviously happening</em>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m visiting the UK for work this week - my first visit ever. A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a public transit system that seems to work: awesome. I landed at London Heathrow, took a subway, a bus, and a regional train and four hours later had arrived in York, some 200 miles away.</li>
<li>For my Iowa friends, this would be like flying into Chicago O&rsquo;Hare and being able to get to Cedar Rapids via public transit. Nifty.</li>
<li>In-room electric teakettle: delightful, and quick. Why don’t we have them in the US? Oh, because the UK wall voltage is 240v and in the US they would work much more slowly.</li>
<li>York is a lovely place so far.</li>
<li>Antique shop here has the same ugly glass display cases that our antique shops in the US have.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Antiques&rdquo; here include tags that say things like &lsquo;Roman, probably 400 BC&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Felt like the authentic British experience last night when I spent my dinner in a pub next to three guys at the bar who were enjoying after-work pints and arguing about football.</li>
<li>Assuming my arranged cab shows up in 30 minutes, now I have to go actually do some work.</li>

			 <p>I got to know Mussorgsky&rsquo;s <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em> when I was in high school and my piano teacher assigned me <em>The Gnome</em>. I never got it mastered as much as I wanted, but it was such a fun suite to hack my way through. I listened to the orchestral version of it, and love the gong at the end, but overall I still prefer the piano version.</p>
<p>This video, though, has me reconsidering my opinion. Guitarist Kazuhito Yamashita has arranged the entire <em>Pictures</em> suite for guitar and it is <em>amazing</em>. He has captured both the feel and almost all the notes from the piano version. He varies playing techniques to create lovely textures of sound. And while I&rsquo;m not up on all the modern classical guitarists, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Yamashita has amazing skill.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just finished up reading Sarah McCammon’s new book <a href="https://amzn.to/4asRBwM"><em>The Exvangelicals</em></a> and I need to take the time to recommend it here. McCammon, a 40-something NPR journalist, has written a book that’s part memoir and part explainer on where Exvangelicals have come from over the past decade, and, more importantly, why.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When <a href="/24/01/the-kindgom-the-power-the-glory/">I reviewed</a> Tim Alberta’s <em>The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory</em> earlier this year, I noted at the time that he was joining a list of kindred spirits who I found online or by reading their books, and who turned out to be fellow devout homeschooled kids who grew into adults questioning evangelical distinctives and dismayed by the devolution of white American evangelicalism into Fox News-watching Republican sheep. I named McCammon at this point as another one of those people. Little did I know how familiar her story would be.</p>
<p>I first encountered Sarah McCammon when she was a host on Iowa Public Radio. Eventually I followed her on Twitter, and continued to read and occasionally interact with her as she moved from Iowa to the east coast, eventually to work directly for NPR. Her reporting during the 2016 presidential campaign was nuanced and insightful. In hindsight, I should’ve known why.</p>
<p>In <em>The Exvangelicals</em>, McCammon unpacks her own story and uses it to illustrate the Exvangelical movement. She’s a few years younger than I am, but our stories run parallel tracks: growing up in the Midwest, a devout churchgoing family, culturally sheltered, homeschooled, evangelical youth groups, marrying young, eventually finding her own faith torn as she experienced the wider world. Eventually she left the church and faith fervor of her youth, getting divorced, becoming an Episcopalian, marrying a Jewish man. Despite so much Evangelical rhetoric saying the Exvangelicals are only leaving because they want to be free to enjoy sin, McCammon recognizes that it’s actually <em>really painful</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaving conservative evangelicalism means giving up the security of silencing some of life’s most vexing and anxiety-inducing questions with a set of “answers” - about the purpose of life, human origins, and what happens after death. It also means losing an entire community of people who could once be relied on to help celebrate weddings and new babies, organize meal trains when you’re sick or bereaved, and provide a built-in network of support and socialization around a shared set of expectations and ideals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s often felt, for me, like a choice between denying my deepest instincts about truth and morality to preserve that community, or being honest with myself and the rest of the world and risking that loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She has summed up there in a single sentence my experience of the last dozen years.</p>
<p>It was interesting reading this book back-to-back with Lyz Lenz’s <a href="https://amzn.to/497Ss4Y"><em>This American Ex-Wife</em></a>. Lyz is another exvangelical, though I don’t know she’d describe herself that way, who writes with an acerbic fire about coming through her evangelical upbringing and a troubled marriage. (Lyz actually provides one of the blurbs on the back of McCammon’s book.) McCammon’s prose is more NPR, Lyz is more shock jock. McCammon makes me comfortably say “yes, this! Exactly this!”. Lyz makes me uncomfortably say “well, she’s not wrong…” They are both important voices whose words should be read and wrestled with.</p>
<p><em>The Exvangelicals</em> is a book I would recommend for anyone outside the evangelical experience trying to understand where us weirdos are coming from, and for any one of us Exvangelical weirdos who wants to feel less alone.</p>

			 <p>Crisanne Werner has <a href="https://reconstructionletters.substack.com/p/performing-music-for-god-or-for-man">a lovely essay up on Substack today</a> about her changing understanding of how the experience of music, and specifically <em>playing</em> music, relates to her spirituality as she goes through a sort of deconstruction.</p>
<p>I, too, have had music be a core part of my spiritual experience for most all of my life. As a worship leader in evangelical churches, I have far too many times heard (and probably used) the &ldquo;audience of One&rdquo; phrase that Crisanne wrestles with in her essay. But I love where she lands with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;music can, and should, bring glory to God. It shouldn’t be manipulated by false humility; it should have an altruistic motivation. But something that didn’t occur to me as a teen/young adult, was that bringing joy to people <em>is</em> bringing glory to God. Using music to evoke emotions that people otherwise wouldn’t have access to is a gift to them. A gift of love. It falls firmly under the umbrella of loving God and loving others. Other people’s music is that same sort of gift to me- my life, especially my spiritual life, is parched without music. And, despite the proliferation of electronic recordings, nothing moves the soul more than an in-person experience.
&hellip; On that church stage this weekend, I was fully at peace with my motivation of helping the congregation enter beauty and joy. I was at peace with my audience being One <em>plus</em> three hundred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I met Crisanne at a retreat last fall and quickly learned that beneath her quiet veneer was a depth of brave wisdom just waiting to come out. I&rsquo;ve so enjoyed reading her Substack this year. What a treat.</p>

			 <p>Dr. Chris Green <a href="https://cewgreen.substack.com/p/can-god-be-surprised">shared part of an essay today</a> on a theology of disagreement. There&rsquo;s a ton of good stuff in it. For example, early on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, what seem to be theological disagreements very often arise from and are borne along by other conflicts rooted deeply in hidden personal and interpersonal anxieties and ambitions. But at least some of our theological disagreements, I want to insist, are in fact the upshot of the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work taking shape in our as-yet-unperfected lives, moving us toward the &ldquo;fullness of Christ&rdquo; in which we find shalom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This represents a beautiful freedom that I never found in my life in the American evangelical church.</p>
<p>But further, I want to commend to your thinking what he says about orthodoxy. In the evangelical and fundamentalist church, &ldquo;orthodoxy&rdquo; tends to be a cudgel used to keep unwanted questions and questioners away, and to scare the flock away from being tempted toward theological ideas that stray from the party line. Green, though, quotes Rowan Williams to suggest a different approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e must reimagine the nature and purpose of orthodoxy. Instead of conceiving of it as a wholly-realized, already-perfected system of thought, we need to recognize it as a fullness of meaning toward which we strive, knowing full well we cannot master it even when in the End we know as we are known. Because the Church&rsquo;s integrity is gift, not achievement, we can never know in advance &ldquo;what will be drawn out of us by the pressure of Christ&rsquo;s reality, what the full shape of a future orthodoxy might be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues, quoting Williams further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orthodoxy is not a system first and foremost of things you&rsquo;ve got to believe, things you&rsquo;ve got to tick off, but is a fullness, a richness of understanding. Orthodox is less an attempt just to make sure everybody thinks the same, and more like an attempt to keep Christian language as rich, as comprehensive as possible. Not comprehensive in the sense of getting everything in somehow, but comprehensive in the sense of keeping a vision of the whole universe in God&rsquo;s purpose and action together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot to chew on there, but I love the vision of orthodoxy as a commitment to keeping a vision for God&rsquo;s continuing purpose and action to which we are only slowly understanding. Beautiful stuff.</p>

			 <p>Richard Beck has a series going right now in which he asserts that the Emerging Church movement failed. I&rsquo;m usually pretty aligned with Beck but I&rsquo;m not so sure this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed.html">He defines the Emerging Church</a> by some familiar characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement with post-modernism</li>
<li>Struggle with evangelical doctrinal positions, leading to epistemic humility</li>
<li>New awareness of liturgy</li>
<li>An &ldquo;aesthetic component&rdquo;, including skinny jeans and a &ldquo;coffee shop vibe&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>That group, <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed_01434064727.html">Beck argues</a>, &ldquo;never was able to establish a broad network of churches&rdquo;, and eventually failed because <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/03/why-emerging-church-movement-failed_0571666223.html">&ldquo;evangelism became deconstruction&rdquo;</a>, and, says Beck, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t build churches upon deconstruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think Beck is setting up a bit of a straw man here to try to make point he wants to make against deconstruction. But I think there&rsquo;s an alternate history to Beck&rsquo;s that comes to a different conclusion.</p>
<p>I think we can see two developments from the Emergent Church of the early 2000s.</p>
<p>First, It&rsquo;s easy to forget that along with Brian McLaren and Rob Bell, people like Mark Driscoll also came along under the Emergent label. The part of Emergent that went the way of Driscoll took an aggressive posture in their engagement with post-modernism, and rejected epistemic humility, but took up at least some pieces of a new liturgy, and were the exemplars of Beck&rsquo;s skinny jeans-wearing, beer-drinking, coffee shop vibing &ldquo;aesthetic component&rdquo;. In short order they would reject McLaren and Bell&rsquo;s post-modernism and fall into doctrinal fundamentalism, but they didn&rsquo;t just disappear as Beck asserts.</p>
<p>Second, Beck severely underplays the movement of many in the Emergent Church into mainstream denominations. Rachel Held Evans famously wrote about <a href="https://rachelheldevans.com/blog/going-episcopal">&ldquo;going Episcopal&rdquo;</a>. Nadia Bolz Weber is ELCA. Scot McKnight became Anglican. Richard Rohr, a Franciscan monk, is the patron saint of the whole movement. Anecdotally, at the less-famous level, I see a steady stream of exvangelicals deconstructing, embracing epistemic humility, rediscovering the historic liturgy, and embracing a more traditional &ldquo;aesthetic component&rdquo; by joining high church mainline traditions.</p>
<p>So did the Emerging Church &ldquo;fail&rdquo; as Beck suggests? Maybe, if you construct your definitions as narrowly as he does. But look just a little more broadly and you can trace a path from the Emergent deconstructionists of the early 2000s to the exvangelicals of the 2010s and 2020s and into the pews of the mainline. Whether we will bring the mainline to a resurgence or only forestall its demise by a few more decades remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Donald Bruce “Don” Hubbs, 74, died Saturday at his home in rural Richland County after a nearly two year battle with brain cancer. Don was born November 15, 1949 in Ellsworth, Kansas, to Lloyd and Marge (Stepp) Hubbs. He grew up in small towns in Kansas and Nebraska before attending Nebraska Wesleyan University and the University of Nebraska, where he received a MA in Music Education. In college he met his future wife, Marjorie Jones, and as school teachers making the most of Christmas break, they were married the day after Christmas, 1971. Don taught high school music for several years before eventually taking up piano tuning and repair, the career he would maintain until his retirement. Later in life he accepted a role in public service as the town clerk for the tiny township he called home, taking up the thankless responsibilities of budget and elections because they needed doing, and needed doing well.</p>
<p>Don’s love and concern for people came through in every situation. He loved meeting and chatting with new acquaintances and old friends; at more than one church he was given a key to the door so he could lock up once he was done chatting after the service. He enjoyed working with his hands, frequently making or building solutions when time was more available than money. He taught his children the value of hard work, faithfulness, and consistency through his example. If music was playing, you would frequently catch him conducting along with it. He passed his love of music on to his children, too; everyone learned at least one instrument and sang. When he had time to relax, Don loved fishing, reading, and listening to classical and jazz music.</p>
<p>During the last few years of his life Don had a fresh enthusiasm in his Christian faith as he explored what he described as the actual “good news” of the Gospel, which he distilled down to seven words: “Fear not. In Christ, God is Love.”</p>
<p>Don is survived by his wife of 52 years, Marj; five children: sons Chris (Becky) of Hiawatha, IA, Ryan of Seattle, WA, Aaron (Emily) of Wonewoc, WI, Andrew (Heather) of Cashmere, WA, and daughter Rebecca (Joel) Grette, of East Wenatchee, Wa, his mother Marge, of Springdale AR, sisters Lou(Bob) Maxson of Kearney, NE, and Joy Hubbs of Springfield, MO, brother David (Shelli) of Springdale AR, and eight grandchildren (Laura, Anwyn, Katie, Abigail, Isaiah, Avery, Henry, and Millie). He was preceded in death by his father, Lloyd, and grandson Burke Grette.</p>
<p>A Celebration of Life will be held at Grace Community Church (County Hwy AA) in Richland Center on Wednesday, Feb. 28th . Visitation will be from 10:30-12:00, with a service and time of sharing at noon. A light lunch will be served, and all are encouraged to stay and fellowship. The Clary Memorial Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements. <a href="https://www.clarymemorialfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Donald-Don-Hubbs/?fbclid=IwAR39WtvVb36aDnvZfh_v3BecsQmpb2F8J7Lqv0bhmsoERHAEMXH0qaOs8KA_aem_Adqjc6bQGDRMiQBBp89s_wDgwOEy22CZSSxiTBePMo29kxJgjQ3vT_HZbr6Iabm-Uow#!/Obituary">Messages for the family may be left there</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/01/16/the-state-of.html">The State of my Task Management, 2024</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/01/16/the-state-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-16 11:41:03 -0500">Jan 16, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As a new year begins and I settle into a new-ish position at work, it has been time to again rethink my task management strategy.</p>
<p>Let’s set out the constraints first. My work computing ecosystem is a highly-constrained Windows laptop. My employer doesn’t provide any sort of task management software, and restricts any data flow between company devices and personal devices. I have access to my work email and calendar on my personal device, but it’s very hard to move data back and forth between domains.</p>
<p>Historically I haven’t really used task management apps. I have downloaded free ones and purchased paid ones on occasion, tried them out for a week or two, and then fell away from them one I got comfortable enough with the new task or role that the overhead of using the tool outweighed the benefit it provided me. I use my email inbox as my primary to-do list. If an email is still in the inbox, it means I need to take action on it. I like to use the inbox “snooze” function when I can to dismiss the email from my inbox and bring it back at some scheduled later date, but unfortunately “snooze” only works on the web version of Outlook, not the app versions, so I rarely use it. The upside of this is that I always have all my pending tasks staring me in the face. The downside of this is that I always have all my pending tasks staring me in the face.</p>
<p>I paid for <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> on my iPhone and iPad a few years ago and have largely neglected them. But right now I have just enough different and new things on my plate between work and church that I need a coordinated reminder system to help make sure I don’t forget something. So last week I jumped back into Things, added a few categories and a couple dozen tasks, put a widget on my iPad Home Screen, and decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>I’m sure I cribbed my basic pattern for using Things from <a href="https://randsinrepose.com">Rands</a> but I have no idea which post. It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>During the day, as new to-dos come up, dump them into the Things inbox with as little overhead as possible.</li>
<li>Every morning, triage that Inbox, assign due dates to things that need them, and file them appropriately into projects.</li>
<li>Every morning, after triage, see what’s in Today. If there’s enough to keep me busy all day, I’m done. If I have some extra bandwidth, review the “Someday” tasks to see if there’s so thing to pull into Today.</li>
<li>Start working and checking off tasks once they’re completed!</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve been working this way for a couple weeks now and I think it might take this time. I really enjoy being able to just quickly dump a to-do onto my phone when I think of it, knowing that I’ve already got a plan for reviewing it later. I have also unexpectedly enjoyed not having all my to-dos staring me in the face. By doing the triage and scheduling tasks, I have a level of comfort in knowing that whatever is on my Today widget on my iPad is all I need to worry about today. I’ve had a couple small panics so far where I jump into the Upcoming view to make sure I do have some particular task scheduled, but I suppose that’ll fade as I start getting more consistent with using Things every day.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/01/07/recommended-reading-the.html">Recommended Reading: The Kingdom, The Power, and The Glory by Tim Alberta</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2024/01/07/recommended-reading-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-07 20:15:02 -0500">Jan 7, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My first completed book of the year is one I can wholeheartedly recommend: <a href="https://amzn.to/3U9layD"><em>The Kingdom, The Power, and The Glory</em></a> by Tim Alberta. Subtitled &ldquo;American Evangelicals in an Age of Extremism&rdquo;, journalist Alberta&rsquo;s book details his many interviews with American Evangelical leaders since the rise of Trump in 2016. He interrogates their motivations, how their words align with their actions, and how those words and actions comport with the teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>Alberta is uniquely positioned to write a book like this. A professional journalist currently with <em>The Atlantic</em>, he has also written for, among others, <em>Politico</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. But, as he reveals in the book&rsquo;s initial chapters, he is also a pastor&rsquo;s kid. His father, up until his untimely death, was the pastor of a large Evangelical Presbyterian church in Michigan. Alberta grew up a devoted Christian within that church, and continues today as a professing Christian. <em>The Kingdom, The Power, and The Glory</em> at places verges on memoir. But Alberta&rsquo;s fluency with  evangelical language, teaching, and culture give him an insight and authority that other journalists would lack.</p>
<p>If you have been following along in the Evangelical culture wars post-2016, most of the folks Alberta discusses will be familiar. He introduces them chapter by chapter: The Falwells and Liberty University, Robert Jeffress, and the Southern Baptist Convention. Firebrands like Greg Locke. Unabashed politicos like Ralph Reed. Fradulent historian David Barton. SBC stalwart-turned-outcast Russell Moore. Journalist Julie Roys. Pastor Brian Zahnd as a Midwestern prosperity preacher turned lonely prophet.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s on purpose or just so close to home (for both the author and me) that Alberta couldn&rsquo;t avoid it, the theme of children of Evangelicals turning and becoming their parents' reproof played over and over through the book. Nick Olson, the son of an early Liberty student who came back to teach, only to be driven away when his politics didn&rsquo;t align. Rachael Denhollender, the conservative homeschooled gymnast who, after bravely testifying against her abuser, became an advocate for sexual abuse victims within her own denomination. Cameron Strang, CEO of <em>Relevant</em> magazine, the son of a religious huckster. Jonathan Falwell, at a crossroads after taking over leadership of the &ldquo;family business&rdquo;, Liberty University. Alberta finally questions his own actions and motivations. Would he have been willing to ask these questions, to write this book, were his father still alive and in the pastorate? That question remains forever unknown. I understand, at least a little bit, Alberta&rsquo;s quandary.</p>
<p>Over the past decade a pattern has emerged for me. When I encounter someone from my generation, usually online, who speaks with a resonant voice of sanity about America&rsquo;s religion and politics, it turns out they, like me, grew up evangelical, usually homeschooled, and have spent their adult lives forging a path out. I&rsquo;m thinking of people like author Lyz Lenz, new NYT film critic Alissa Wilkinson, writer and editor (and Alissa&rsquo;s former podcast-hosting sidekick) Sam Thielman, NPR journalist Sarah McCammon, and famous lawyer spouse Jacob Denhollander, kindred spirits all. I&rsquo;m now going to add Tim Alberta to that list.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, Alberta expresses an uncertain hope that this younger generation is successfully turning the evangelical world away from the worst of its political debauchery. To my mind, that jury is still out. Leader after leader throughout the book express their befuddlement and confusion as to why so much of the Evangelical church has been willing to follow political prophets away from the call of Jesus. Like them, Alberta doesn&rsquo;t have the answer. But with this book, he has done what he can: incontrovertably documenting the political corruption of the American Evangelical church for anyone willing to read it.</p>

<p>That <em>may</em> be changing here in the next week or two, with a new possible travel destination for me: York, UK. Somehow I&rsquo;ve been to Europe 8 or 9 times but never to the UK. I&rsquo;d be happy to add it to my list!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>One of my goals from previous years was to read fewer books written by white guys. By my count, 24 of this year&rsquo;s books meet that goal&hellip; which isn&rsquo;t as good as I&rsquo;d hoped it would be. That science section didn&rsquo;t help in that regard. I made a stronger shift this year, though, away from theology and to science. That wasn&rsquo;t super-intentional, but just where my interest was at the time.</p>
<p>On to 2024! I&rsquo;m nearly halfway through my first book of the year.</p>

			 <p>I have hacked through the Chopin Ballades for years now. I started learning the first one in high school, and in adulthood I played through #3 and #4 often enough that I can, well, hack through them. I never spent the time working everything out and polishing; I just kept sight reading until I could blaze through it.</p>
<p>This past week I decided it was time to actually sit down with #4 and work it out more carefully. Today I got to this pictured section which, when sight reading, had always thrown me for a loop. Practicing the right hand by itself, I finally realized what makes it such a pain.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s 6/8 time. On the first line, the bass has gone to triplets in each eighth note. Then on the second line, the right hand picks up triplets per eighth, while the left switches to sixteenths. Ok, that’s 3 against 2, no big deal.</p>
<p>But while the right hand is in triplets, the pattern written (as indicated by the eighth notes on the up stems) is a four-note pattern, almost an Alberti pattern. So, you have what is by pattern a four-beat pattern, played as triplets against two in the bass. My brain wants to interpret that as four against two, which is very simple. But it&rsquo;s not - rhythmically, it&rsquo;s 3 against 2, but the 3s are logically and musically grouped in sets of four. This one is gonna take my brain a while to work out.</p>

			 <p>A big chunk of effort in <a href="/23/12/migrating-to-eleventy">migrating the blog</a> was going through each post to review and clean up content. On the technical side, I started by using <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown">a conversion tool</a> that took the Wordpress data dump and transformed it into Markdown files. It was good as far as it went. But it was only so good. I ended up touching every post back to 2004, tagging, cleaning up formatting, improving links when possible, removing them when they were super-dead, etc. It took a while. But it gave me the opportunity to review my own progression of thought and growth in a way I wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise been able to, and that made it well worth it. Today I want to review some impressions this review left on me.</p>
<h2 id="post-content-and-strategy">Post Content and Strategy</h2>
<p>Man, back in the early years I posted <em>a lot</em>. Almost every day for a while, or at least multiple times a week. I started this blog a solid two years before Twitter went live or Facebook became available for non-students, and I used it for a lot of mundane life updates that would eventually move over to FB and Twitter. Once I started engaging on those platforms (and particularly Twitter), my blog posting tailed off to something closer to its current state - roughly one post per week at most.</p>
<p>One thing hasn&rsquo;t changed so much: I post a <em>lot</em> about books I&rsquo;m reading. I have written year-in-review blog posts since 2007. My <a href="/tag/books">books tag</a> has 165 posts. At times I tried to post about every single book I read; now I&rsquo;m doing that in short form over on <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com">my books site</a> and only summarizing and sharing highlights here. Still reading lots of Christian thought and theology, too. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-thought">Evolution of thought</h2>
<p>I grew up in a very conservative, nay, fundamentalist Christian household. Those lessons stuck with me long into adulthood. To steal a hopefully-not-too-outdated term from the youths, wow, a lot of my old content is <em>cringe</em>. To be gentle with myself: I was doing my best to fit in and emulate the examples of good Christian people that I saw and read. And boy, I was good at it. The evangelical-ese just dripped from my tongue. I was super-earnest (good, I guess) and super-presumptuous that I had it figured out (not so good).</p>
<p>I was not always an LGBTQIA-affirming person. I didn&rsquo;t write anything super-offensive even in my non-affirming days, but I was very clearly non-affirming. You can see cracks starting to form in that wall back as early as 2007 when <a href="/07/09/should-this-really-be-our-fight/">I pondered whether the church should be fighting same-sex marriage</a>. In 2008 I was <a href="/08/11/recognizing-the-civil-religious-disconnect-or-what-to-do-about-gay-marriage/">reading a bunch of Andrew Sullivan</a>, and was more convinced that same-sex civil marriage should be OK. By 2014 <a href="/14/05/gentleness-and-respect-for-all-addressing-the-transgender-issue/">I was fully uncertain</a> what I thought about trans issues, but was sure that we shouldn&rsquo;t be breaking bruised reeds. I was at heart fully affirming sometime before the COVID era, but I&rsquo;m sad it took until 2022 for me to publicly post about it.</p>
<p>My journey through and eventually out of evangelicalism was clearly also a search for heroes I could latch onto. Sadly, my posting chronicles how one by one they have fallen. John Piper (eek). Mark Driscoll. Matt Chandler. More recently, and less notably, but still: John G. Stackhouse. I listened to them, quoted them, looked up to them&hellip; and then watched them fall by the wayside. Their less-famous acolytes championed so many others that also went off the rails: Mahaney, MacDonald, Mohler. Maybe this accelerated my departure from evangelicalism as much as anything.</p>
<p>I still have a long way to go to undo the tangled mess of my childhood fundamentalism, but I&rsquo;m happy to see progress. We&rsquo;ll see what another 20 years bring.</p>
<h2 id="random-thoughts-and-surprises">Random thoughts and Surprises</h2>
<ol>
<li>If you&rsquo;d asked me who was most influential in my theological evolution by default I&rsquo;d say N. T. Wright. But if you look back through 20 years of blog posts, another name rises to the surface: <a href="/tag/richard-beck/">Richard Beck</a>. I guess if you need a complement to an Anglican bishop, a Texan Church of Christ psychology professor is a good fit. My nerd self has a ton of respect for the fact that Beck has been <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/">blogging on Blogspot</a> since God only knows when and only recently added a Substack since nobody except me uses RSS any more.</li>
<li>There is one song whose lyrics I quoted probably more than all other songs combined: Rich Mullins' &ldquo;Land of My Sojourn&rdquo;. Amusingly enough, I don&rsquo;t have those lyrics memorized. I quoted them first <a href="/05/10/so-i-call-you-my-country-and-ill-be-lonely-for-my-home/">as early as 2005</a> and <a href="/17/10/land-of-my-sojourn/">as recently as 2017</a> and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll pull them out again before long.</li>
<li>There have been friends along the way who are, amazingly, still there and still influential, many of whom I have met in-person rarely or never. We owe Geof <a href="/22/06/geof-f-morris-1978-2022/">(RIP)</a> for being the community leader and glue who brought us together, and I&rsquo;m not sure any of us will appropriately uphold his legacy. I risk disappointing many by naming any, but two must be named here. <strong>Kari</strong> (whom I have never met in person but someday simply <em>must</em>), a children&rsquo;s- librarian-turned-ordained-Baptist-minister who gave me an example of what a Christian feminist looks like, and who always had a timely encouraging word even when I was much more stubborn and conservative than I am now. And then there&rsquo;s <strong>Dan</strong>. Have we really only met up that once? Dan is my Canadian brother-from-another-mother, homeschool kid, pianist, sometime worship leader, programmer, armchair theologian, and, most importantly, the inventor of the <a href="/tag/bullet-points/">bullet points format</a> that I adopted. Before we met in person I thought there&rsquo;s no way this guy could <em>really</em> be this awesome in person. Then we met and I found out I was wrong. One of these days, my friend, we&rsquo;ll meet again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write a proper 20-year anniversary post when October 2024 comes. In the mean time, I&rsquo;m glad I had the chance for this retrospective.</p>
<p>Life, man.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this post, you&rsquo;re seeing the updated ChrisHubbs.com as generated by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator. After being on Wordpress for nearly twenty years, this was a significant change!</p>
<h2 id="why-leave-wordpress">Why leave Wordpress?</h2>
<p>I mean, twenty years of history can&rsquo;t be all bad, right? Wordpress was originally released in May 2003, and by October 2004 I had a blog up and running it. (Well, Geof was administering it for the first couple years. RIP.) And Wordpress has had amazing growth over two decades and runs a lot of the internet&rsquo;s websites.</p>
<p>But Wordpress was starting to get frustrating. They seem to be working harder and harder to monetize it, even for users of the free product. Want any social features, sharing, analytics, etc? Use the Jetpack extension. Which is free for some functionality, paid for other. OK, I guess. But then they start giving you dashboard &ldquo;site health indicators&rdquo; which will tell you that you have problems and the only solution is to subscribe to the paid service. No thanks.</p>
<h2 id="why-eleventy">Why Eleventy?</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of static site generators out there. I considered both Eleventy and <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and did some demo work with each. In the end, I found a nice site theme/template I liked build in Eleventy, and it managed to build my full site without any hiccups. It&rsquo;s a big site, so that&rsquo;s a win. My path to publishing is a little more intensive than it was under Wordpress, but when I only publish weekly at best, I can survive that. It&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> hard.</p>
<h2 id="so-almost-twenty-years">So, almost twenty years?</h2>
<p>Yeah, it was a lot of posts. I cleaned up some of them that were just dead links, but I kept most of them around. Once all the cleanup was done I have 1263 posts migrated over. This one now makes 1264. It feels both monumental and trivial at the same time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do a separate post with some more personal thoughts that were prompted by going through almost 20 years of my written thoughts. But for now, hey, at least it&rsquo;s functional!</p>

			 <p>A year ago <a href="/22/11/setting-up-a-mastodon-instance-on-linode/">I set up my own Mastodon server</a> at iowadon.org. Elon Musk had just bought Twitter and was quite obviously going to ruin it, Bluesky was still a very small beta test, and I thought hey, why not, I would enjoy the project and could try my hand at administrating a social media instance. So I dropped $15 for the domain name and $50 for a year of a cheap VPS and gave it a shot.</p>
<p>It was indeed a fun challenge getting it set up. Once I had it up and functional it was low-maintenance enough - an occasional small version upgrade, a couple moderation requests to resolve. I never promoted the instance much, and as a result I never had more than about half a dozen active users, most of whom I knew personally. And it was fine. But as my domain came up for renewal I asked myself if it was something I wanted to continue, and I decided the answer was no.</p>
<p>It’s not a cost thing. I paid $5/mo to Linode for object storage, and absorbed the server costs by sharing the VPS with some other websites I host. (The things you can get away with when your instance only hosts a few users…) It was a little bit the maintenance time. There was a major upgrade to the Mastodon server queued up and, for the first time in a year, it didn’t run smoothly. And I didn’t feel like spending hours trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>It was also a little bit that Bluesky has opened up, and my social network has hit a pretty good critical mass there. At the moment I’m keeping an eye on both Mastodon and Bluesky, but Bluesky is getting more of my time and interaction. And so I migrated my iowadon.org account over to mastodon.social, emailed all my active users to give them a month’s warning, and at the end of the month I shut it down.</p>
<p>It was a fun experiment, and I’m still bullish on Mastodon as a social network. But after a year of running my own, I’m happy to be just a user again on someone else’s server.</p>

<p>This morning a headline came across my social media feed, with a link to a remarkable interview with actor Sir Patrick Stewart, best known for playing Jean-Luc Picard on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> for seven seasons. In <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/04/1203298903/patrick-stewart-star-trek-ministry-picard">this interview with NPR reporter Rachel Martin</a>, Stewart describes his time playing Picard with strong religious tones. When Martin noted that many <em>Star Trek</em> fans treat the show with almost a religious reverence, Stewart said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. I see it very, very clearly and very strongly. It was about truth and fairness and honesty and respect for others, no matter who they were or what strange alien creature they looked like. That was immaterial. They were alive. And if they needed help, Jean Luc Picard and his crew, his team, were there to give it.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <strong>In a sense, we were ministers</strong>. And I have heard now so many times from individuals who have been honest enough and brave enough to tell me aspects of their life, of their health, of their mental health. And how it was all saved and improved by watching every week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I came to <em>ST:TNG</em> right about the time it finished airing, and eventually caught up via VHS recordings. And while I may not be a full-blown Trekkie, <em>TNG</em> is my comfort watch. At its best, the <em>Star Trek</em> series—and especially <em>TNG</em>—portrayed an optimistic future where technology and diplomacy had taken care of systemic social issues; where the leading adults were grown-ups who behaved responsibly, admitted their faults, and worked for the greater good.</p>
<p>None was better in this regard than Stewart&rsquo;s Captain Picard. He was the best of what you as a man might want to be - an accomplished leader, an artist, a man who put his crew&rsquo;s needs before his own and held to his principles even when it cost him dearly. In a world of entertainment where so many actors turn out to be real scuzzballs in their personal lives, seeing Stewart reach old age and maintain, by all accounts, his reputation as a man of integrity, it&rsquo;s hard not to feel his real-life person and his onscreen role merge just a little bit. It warms my heart to see this acclaimed example of a good man.</p>
<p>Whether Stewart attracted good people or just rubbed off on them I don&rsquo;t know, but the men who acted around Stewart have also continued to display honorable attributes long after the show was done. Wil Wheaton, who played the teenager Wesley Crusher on the show, recounts in his memoir how Stewart and Jonathan Frakes (Commander Will Riker) were men who showed him what a real father should be like after Wheaton&rsquo;s own parents abused him. And then there&rsquo;s Levar Burton, who for the seven years of <em>ST:TNG</em>, and for 16 more years around it, hosted <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow">Reading Rainbow</a></em>, encouraging a love of books and reading to children via public television.</p>
<p>None of these men went on to build great empires; none needed to play (or try to be, in real life) overly macho men. And yet here, decades later, they are beloved by so many simply because they have maintained integrity in their lives as men of gentleness and humility.</p>
<p>These led me to think about another humble, gentle man who I&rsquo;ve written about before who fits the same mold, and who spent decades on television in a similar way. I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about Fred Rogers. Again we have a man who in most ways wouldn&rsquo;t live up to the expectations of American masculinity, but who portrayed love, care, generosity, and humility in a way that was as fully genuine in person as it was on the screen.</p>
<p>I can almost hear the response pieces being written at Christian outlets like The Gospel Coalition already. Clearly, they&rsquo;d say, that as nice as Stewart seems, his &ldquo;ministry&rdquo; is some sort of false gospel since, well, he doesn&rsquo;t believe in God. They&rsquo;d say all his righteousness is false. They&rsquo;d say he supports liberal social causes and calls himself a feminist, so clearly he&rsquo;s problematic.</p>
<p>I have been out of evangelicalism long enough to not care what TGC says any more, but having steeped in it for so long, and having had so many people dear to me who embrace that kind of thinking, I want to offer an alternate take. It goes like this:</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to put scare quotes around &ldquo;good&rdquo; when we talk about men like Stewart, Frakes, or Burton. We recognize admirable characteristics in them <em>because they are there</em>. I might even crib a list that includes things like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self control&hellip;</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m gonna get all heretical. If these men (or other people like them) are demonstrating the characteristics that Christians know as &ldquo;fruit of the Spirit&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m gonna say that this is evidence of God&rsquo;s spirit working in them and through them. They may not acknowledge it as such, or even that such a thing exists. But if God is &ldquo;over all and in all and through all&rdquo; (Ephesians 4), then does it have to be a big stretch to acknowledge people who model the virtues and priorities that Jesus taught, even if they ascribe them to somewhere else?</p>
<p>The freedom of seeing that God is truly reconciling <em>the whole world</em> has led to a glorious freedom to recognize, admire, and love the good in others without feeling the need to nit pick their theological beliefs. Those who practice the fruit of the Spirit, who do justly and love mercy, who cry out for the poor and oppressed—they will find entering the fulness of the kingdom of God to only be a gentle step from (to borrow Paul&rsquo;s words) worshiping in ignorance to worshiping in knowledge. Those who carefully articulate a theological line while modeling arrogance, hostility, and gracelessness, though, may find the kingdom to be a bit more of an adjustment.</p>

			 <p>This old concert recording of Rich Mullins at a Wheaton College chapel service in 1997 is an internet classic, but listening through it again today I was struck by his wisdom about the love of God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am at an academic place so I need to speak highly of serious stuff. Although I have trouble with serious stuff, I have to admit, because I just think life&rsquo;s too short to get too heavy about everything. And I think there are easier ways to lose money than by farming, and I think there are easier ways to become boring than by becoming academic. And I think, you know, the thing everybody really wants to know anyway is not what the Theory of Relativity is. <strong>But I think what we all really want to know anyway is whether we are loved or not.</strong> And that&rsquo;s why I like the Scriptures, because <strong>you get the feeling from reading them that we might be</strong>. And if we were able to really know that, we wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the rest of the stuff. The rest of it would be more fun, I think. Cause right now we take it so seriously, I think, because of our basic insecurity about whether we are loved are not.</p>
<p>I think you should study because your folks have probably sunk a lot of money into this, and it&rsquo;d be ungrateful not to. But your life doesn&rsquo;t depend on it. That was what I loved about being a student in my 40s as opposed to in my 20s is I had the great knowledge that you could live for at least half a century and not know a thing and get along pretty well.</p>

<p>We have attended an Episcopal church now for a few months, enough times at least to get sucked into volunteering for small roles on a Sunday morning. A month ago Becky and I served as greeters/ushers for the service, which she noted might be the first time we&rsquo;ve ever signed up for a service task that we did <em>together</em>. (Usually I&rsquo;m the musician and she&rsquo;s working in the kitchen somewhere.)</p>
<p>Then a couple weeks ago I did the musician thing and played the piano for a service. But we have a regular pianist on the payroll who&rsquo;s not me (which is a good thing!) so this upcoming Sunday I&rsquo;m trying something else: I&rsquo;m gonna be a reader.</p>
<p>I have been assigned the Old Testament reading and the Psalm. I will be practicing ahead of time so that we can avoid any &ldquo;banana&rdquo; moments.</p>

			 <p>One of the fun things about attending a church in a new and unfamiliar tradition is that things that may be common, old hat, or even tiredly predictable to lifelong participants in the tradition are new and can bring delight to us newbs.</p>
<p>Current example: yesterday morning I thumbed through the worship booklet before the service and saw that the gospel hymn was familiar: Eternal Father, Strong to Save. I know this one primarily as &ldquo;The Navy Hymn&rdquo;, could probably sing the first verse from memory, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever sung it in church before. <em>A bit of an odd choice</em>, I thought, <em>but it&rsquo;s at least fun to sing</em>.</p>
<p>And it was, indeed, fun to sing. It&rsquo;s in a good range, it&rsquo;s got some fun harmonic progressions, and for being a small and older congregation, there are still some good harmony singers belting it out.</p>
<p>Then the deacon started into the gospel reading and suddenly the reason for the song selection became very clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but by this time the boat, battered by the waves, was far from the land, for the wind was against them. And early in the morning he came walking toward them on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear. But immediately Jesus spoke to them and said, “Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid.”</p>
<p>Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he noticed the strong wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” When they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”</p>
<p>Matthew 14:22-33</p>

			 <p>Setting: a local homeowner has an old dishwasher that is dying. A new dishwasher was delivered and is sitting in the garage, waiting to be installed.</p>
<p><strong>Lowe’s Trip #1: Electrical Stuff</strong></p>
<p>The old dishwasher had just a raw electrical cable coming from the unit. The wire ran through a hole in the floor and was connected up to the breaker box in the basement using wire nuts. The new dishwasher has a proper electric plug. So on the way home from work I hit Lowe’s for a grey electrical box, a GFCI plugin, and an outlet cover plate.</p>
<p>Came home, wired up the box before dinner. Got out a big drill bit and expanded the hole in the floor to fit the big plug.</p>
<p><strong>Lowe’s Trip #2: Water line</strong></p>
<p>I don’t do plumbing work that often, but when I do, it’s the little latent leaks that make me nervous. I read the installation manual for the dishwasher and it suggested “hook up the water line, turn on the water, and check for leaks before putting the unit in place”. <em>Great idea</em>, I thought. However, the existing water line wasn’t long enough to make that work.</p>
<p>Hit Lowe’s again, bought a longer water line. Hooked it up to the dishwasher. Ran the hose down through a separate hole in the floor, hooked it up to the water pipe in the basement. Turned the water on. No leaks.</p>
<p>Ran the electric plug end through the hole in the floor, plugged it in. We have power. Now we just need to hook up the drain hose.</p>
<p>The drain hose boot is marked that it will accommodate up to a 7/8” pipe. The PVC drain pipe plumbed up to the dishwasher location is marked 3/4”, but it turns out that’s 3/4” <em>inside diameter</em>. Outside diameter is a solid one inch. And the rubber boot doesn’t stretch that much.</p>
<p><strong>Lowe’s Trip #3: Drain Pipe Fitting</strong></p>
<p>Perused the PVC aisle. Then to the next aisle over with kitchen plumbing supplies. A “standard” dishwasher install would have it near the sink so the drain hose could tie in to the sink drain. Ours is on the opposite side of the kitchen, so whoever did the first dishwasher install here (sometime well after the house was built in 1959) ran the PVC drain line down through the floor and across the basement ceiling to tie in to the drain there. But I digress.</p>
<p>On the second trip through the PVC aisle, my wife notices the exact fitting we need. Sized to fit the 1” outside diameter pipe on one end, with a tapering ribbed end opposite it to grab a drain boot. I knew I had PVC glue at home, so paid for the fitting and headed back.</p>
<p>Grabbed the cans of PVC primer and glue from the basement. Opened up the primer and primed both pieces. Opened up the glue. It had solidified into jelly. Read the instructions on the back of the can. “Do not use if glue has hardened.” Deep, frustrated sigh.</p>
<p><strong>Lowe’s Trip #4: PVC Glue</strong></p>
<p>I know exactly where it is after perusing the PVC aisle less than twenty minutes previous. Head back home.</p>
<p>Glued up the fitting to the drain pipe. Let it sit for twenty minutes to harden up. Hooked up the drain hose. Carefully slid the dishwasher back into its slot. Confirmed that the hoses weren’t kinked. Nervously checked for drips under the water line fitting a couple more times. Still seemed ok.</p>
<p>PVC glue said to wait two hours before putting any pressure on the joint. Two hours later was getting close to bedtime, so we put the unit on the quick cycle to try it out. Had a minor heart attack when the display turned off every time we shut the dishwasher door. Found the full manual online and discovered that was by design. Let it run. 60 minutes later: clean dishes.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping I don’t have to repeat that task any time soon.</p>

Today I’m reading her book <em>Christ in Evolution</em>, wherein she provides a longer version of that insight. I heard her say something similar on the B4NP podcast, and it was the biggest lightbulb moment I’ve had in a while. I’m still not entirely sure what to do with it, but the core of the idea seems just right.</p>
<p>So from chapter 1 (paragraph breaks and emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his book <em>A Window to the Divine</em>, Zachary Hayes writes that “a careful reading of the theological tradition prior to the modern era indicates that before the so-called Copernican revolution … there existed a religious cosmology that involved not only the insights of faith but the physical understanding of the cosmos as it was known at that time. The breakdown of such a cosmology by the shift from a geocentric model to a heliocentric model led eventually to <strong>the isolation of theology from the development of modern science</strong>.”</p>
<p>The most fundamental shift in our understanding of the cosmos is the move from the vision of a universe launched essentially in its present form by the hand of the creator at the beginning of time to a vision of the cosmos as a dynamic, unfolding chemical process, immensely large in both time and space…</p>
<p>According to Hayes, we live in two worlds. In our everyday experience we live in a culture deeply conditioned by the insights and theories of modern science. But in the context of the church, its theology and liturgy, we live in a premodern world. <strong>Christian theology, he states, no longer has an effective cosmology that enables believers to relate to the world in its physical character in a way that is consistent with their religious symbols.</strong> We need to reshape our religious understanding of the world, he claims, by engaging our faith with the best insights of science concerning the nature of the physical world.</p>
<p>Ilia Delio, <em>Christ in Evolution</em>, Chapter 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I’ve listened to Delio on a number of podcasts and read a couple of her books (with more on the pile to read), I’m amazed by how clearly she can embrace the Bible’s teaching about Jesus but interpret it in ways that embraces modern science — ways that are very different than the anti-scientific approach most churches I’ve been a part of have held to.</p>
<p>My heart and imagination come alive as I consider these possibilities. “There’s so much beauty around us for just two eyes to see,” wrote Rich Mullins. And with these new lenses through which to consider the cosmos, I echo his next line: “And everywhere I go, I’m looking”.</p>

			 <p><em>&ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; Who can know it?&rdquo; &ndash; Jeremiah 17:9, NKJV</em></p>
<p>I had someone play the Jeremiah 17:9 card on me the other day. We were winding up a long email conversation wherein I finally was able to make clear that the standard evangelical hermeneutical approach to the Scriptures isn&rsquo;t particularly appealing to me any more - that there are other approaches I find more compelling. (Brian Zahnd&rsquo;s post <a href="https://brianzahnd.com/2015/02/jesus-god-say/">Jesus Is What God Has To Say</a> captures it pretty well for me right now at a high level.)</p>
<p>Once I got that message across, the message from my conversation partner was simple: beware your motives and understanding, because, after all, the heart is deceitful above all things!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the evangelical circles I&rsquo;ve spent my life in, Jeremiah 17:9 is used as a sort of ultimate trump card. If a discussion starts to go sideways, if someone comes to a logical conclusion that something they&rsquo;ve been taught just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be correct, if someone questions how God could possibly be in the right for, say, ordering the murder of innocent children, this is the fallback. <em>Of course your heart rebels against that thought. Your heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked! You need to accept that what we are teaching you is correct and ignore any prompting inside you that says otherwise!</em></p>
<p>There are problems, thought, with the Jeremiah 17:9 card.</p>
<h3 id="logical-coherence">Logical Coherence</h3>
<p>First: playing the Jeremiah 17:9 card is logically incoherent. How did the card player become convinced of the rightness of their position in the first place? Undoubtedly through some combination of study, reasoning, and <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/philosophical-intuition-just-what-is-a-priori-justification">internal desire</a> (even if subconscious) to hold that position. So how does the card player know that it isn&rsquo;t <em>his own</em> heart that is deceiving him rather than yours deceiving you? If our heart (i.e. our reasoning as supplemented and powered by our instincts) is deceitful, what basis do you have for claiming that yours is so much <em>less</em> deceitful than mine that your conclusion is right and mine is wrong?</p>
<h3 id="other-bible-verses">Other Bible Verses</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend pulling single verses from their context and using them to justify positions. It&rsquo;s a bad way to understand the Bible. But if you&rsquo;re going to play that game, there is a broad selection of other verses about the heart that might provide an alternative perspective to Jeremiah 17:9.</p>
<p><em>Proverbs 4:23: &ldquo;Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.&quot;</em> - This sounds like your heart has something <em>good</em> in it that needs to be protected!</p>
<p><em>Psalm 51:10: &ldquo;Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.&quot;</em> - The psalmist sure seems to think that purity of heart is a goal worth asking for and attaining to.</p>
<p><em>Proverbs 3:3: &ldquo;Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.&quot;</em> - We can have love and faithfulness written on our heart!</p>
<p><em>Ezekiel 36:26: &ldquo;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.&quot;</em> - If God gives me a new heart and a new spirit, maybe that new heart is good?</p>
<p><em>2 Corinthians 9:7: &ldquo;Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&quot;</em> - This one is kinda fun&hellip; decide in your heart what to give! God will be happy with this!</p>
<p><em>Psalm 119:11: &ldquo;I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.&quot;</em> - This one speaks directly to the effects of discipleship upon the heart - the heart is improved and the result is less sinning!</p>
<p><em>Hebrews 3:12: &ldquo;See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.&quot;</em> - The existence of a &ldquo;sinful, unbelieving heart&rdquo; implies the existence of a holy, believing heart that is turned toward God.</p>
<p><em>Proverbs 23:15: &ldquo;My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed.&quot;</em> - Solomon suggests that a heart can be wise!</p>
<p>I hope the point here is clear - if you want to play the game of cherry picking to proof-text your point, why is the Jeremiah 17:9 card a more valid and applicable cherry than any of these verses?</p>
<h3 id="potential-for-gaslighting-and-abuse">Potential for Gaslighting and Abuse</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.insider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/what-is-gaslighting">Gaslighting</a> is a strategy in which a perpetrator bends another person&rsquo;s sense of reality and belief system, making that person second-guess themselves in a way that is beneficial to the perpetrator. <a href="https://www.insider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/gaslighting-examples">Typical gaslighting phrases</a> include things like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think I&rsquo;d make that up?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I did that because I love you.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too sensitive.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that bad. Other people have it much worse.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re making such a big deal out of this.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to see how &ldquo;the heart is deceitful above all things&rdquo; could fit right in to a gaslighting strategy. A spiritual leader abuses a person in some way. That person responds with a concern. <em>This doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Something is off here.</em> The leader points right to Jeremiah. <em>Your heart is deceitful and desperately wicked. Don&rsquo;t trust it.</em> And the abuse continues as the victim is further confused between the truth of the matter clear to their conscience and the deception and malpractice of their abuser.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>A robust examination of discernment - how it works, how we integrate our instinctual &ldquo;gut feelings&rdquo;, how we experience the influence of the Holy Spirit, how we come to understand God&rsquo;s Word and leading through the wisdom of community - would require far more words than I could write here. Whatever discernment is, though, it&rsquo;s certainly not so simply summed up as &ldquo;your heart is deceitful, don&rsquo;t trust it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of living in a constant spirit of fear, Christians should live in a spirit of confidence that God is guiding them. If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, you&rsquo;ll forgive me one proof-text for this that also suggests God wants us to use our minds, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</p>
<p>2 Timothy 1:7, NKJV</p>

<p><em>If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless.</em></p>
<p><em>But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.</em></p>
<p><em>&ndash;The Apostle Paul, Letter to the Philippians</em></p>
<p>I have many times read this passage and heard it taught with the message &ldquo;your family history and good works don&rsquo;t matter, only giving up everything and serving Jesus matters&rdquo;. As I read it today, though, where I am in my Christian journey, it hits a little bit different.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-own-personal-philippians-3">My own personal Philippians 3</h2>
<p>If anyone thinks they have confidence in their evangelical Christian credentials, I have more.</p>
<p>I prayed to ask Jesus into my heart when I was 3. I was baptized by immersion at a Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance church after giving testimony to my faith when I was 7 or 8.</p>
<p>My church started <a href="https://www.awana.org/">AWANA clubs</a> when I was in first grade. I completed 3 years worth of Sparks club in 2 years to get the associated trophy. I completed every year of AWANA after that, all the way through high school, memorizing hundreds of Bible verses. I was given the AWANA <a href="https://www.awana.org/product/citation-award-and-pin/">Citation Award</a> at AWANA national Bible Quizzing and Olympics. My team didn&rsquo;t win the Olympics, but won the sportsmanship award, which is probably even more meritorious.</p>
<p>I was homeschooled in a Christian homeschool grades 1 through 12. I learned from the best Christian curricula. I soaked up <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/bios/ken-ham/">Ken Ham</a>&rsquo;s creation science videos in Sunday School and youth group. As a 7th grader I sent a letter to my best friend, aghast that he entertained the possibility of &ldquo;long-day&rdquo; creation. I quoted <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204&amp;version=NIV">2 Timothy 4</a> to him and said I would be one of the ones who stood up when others were going wobbly.</p>
<p>I attended an <a href="https://basicseminar.com/seminar/basic-seminar/">IBLP Basic Seminar</a> when I was in high school. I bought and took home a cassette tape of their Gothard-blessed choir arrangements of hymns, excited to have Godly music to listen to. I attended a church with the authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Full-Quiver-Family-Planning-Lordship/dp/0943497833">a Quiverfull book</a> and the midwife <a href="https://www.gawker.com/the-duggars-homeschool-cult-cabbage-patch-dolls-are-po-1710094250">who reported in Gothard&rsquo;s newsletter</a> that a Cabbage Patch Kids doll was being used by the devil to prevent a healthy home birth.</p>
<p>I was fully invested in the political implications of my evangelical faith. I speed-dialed Rush Limbaugh and tried to convince his call screener that I should talk to Rush about the dangers of the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child">UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. I bought a constitutional law overview book written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Farris_(lawyer)">Michael Farris</a> and was jittery with excitement when I got to hear him speak and shake his hand. I marched in a parade carrying a campaign sign for a Republican Senate candidate.</p>
<p>I sat in years of adult &ldquo;precept by precept, line by line&rdquo; Bible study. I went through <a href="https://evangelismexplosion.org/">Evangelism Explosion</a> training, memorized all the cards, and went door-to-door asking people &ldquo;if you died tonight, and God asked &lsquo;why should I let you into my heaven?&rsquo;, what would you say?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I passed up full-ride scholarship offers to public universities and instead took out loans to attend a Christian university. I lived in a dormitory that only allowed opposite-gender visits for 3 hours on Friday nights and 3 hours on Sunday afternoons under supervision. I took 15 credits of Bible and Christian ethics along with my engineering classes in order to graduate.</p>
<p>I started leading worship in church when I was in high school. I led worship at church and in college chapel during my college years. I joined a Baptist church within the first month of moving to Iowa and within the first year was leading worship there. I formed the team, led practices, led the music at multiple services every week for years. I met weekly with the church staff to evaluate the previous week&rsquo;s services and plan for the upcoming week.</p>
<p>I became a deacon at that Baptist church before the age of 30. Then I became an elder. I attended the Emmaus Bible College pastor&rsquo;s conference, the Moody Bible Institute pastor&rsquo;s conference, and the Desiring God pastor&rsquo;s conference. I led Bible studies, did in-home pastoral care visits, tracked giving and sent out yearly giving receipts.</p>
<p>I was part of an elder team that planted a new church in an under-churched neighborhood near downtown in our city. I did tech setup and tear-down and led worship there every week for two years.</p>
<p>I moved to a larger Evangelical Free church. I served on the worship team there and became the interim music ministry leader when the staff worship pastor left. For multiple years we did three-service weekends spanning Saturday night and Sunday morning with full band and tech team.</p>
<p>I read hundreds of books on theology and the church. I read John Piper, Tim Keller, Don Carson, Francis Schaeffer, Mark Driscoll, Russell Moore, and N. T. Wright. I led book discussions, wrote blog posts about them, and bought extra copies to give away to others.</p>
<p>I had three children and raised them in the church. I pushed for us to homeschool them. I dragged them to church every time we went. I did read-alouds of the Jesus Storybook Bible and all the Chronicles of Narnia with them. I drove them to youth group, encouraged them to volunteer, taught them instruments or got them lessons so they could join the worship team themselves.</p>
<h2 id="but-jesus">But Jesus</h2>
<p>Somewhere in all those years, Jesus stepped in.</p>
<p>Jesus opened my eyes to his love for every person. Even and especially for those who didn&rsquo;t look like me or believe the way I did.</p>
<p>Jesus made it clear to me that all my book learning and ability to argue people into a corner was a harsh cacophony if I didn&rsquo;t actually love those people and want their best.</p>
<p>Jesus showed me that God loves my loved ones even more than I do, and that God&rsquo;s love is the same in kind, and infinitely greater in quality and quantity, as my own love for family is.</p>
<p>Jesus made it clear to me that so much of the memorization and learning and doctrine we were so proud of as evangelicals manifested as unloving, judgmental, manipulative gate-keeping to those who weren&rsquo;t in our little club.</p>
<p>Jesus helped me see that God&rsquo;s plan for the universe is so much greater and more redemptive than rescuing a small fraction of holy humans out of a burning earth into an ethereal heavenly plane.</p>
<p>Jesus made it clear to me that his desire is for followers who love God and love their neighbor rather than those who cling to power through politics, nationalism, racism, and misogyny.</p>
<p>Jesus showed me that loving my neighbor might actually mean directly caring for my literal next-door neighbors more than it means laboring to support church programs while I hold good intentions in my heart for others and invite them to those programs.</p>
<p>Whatever my accomplishments were to me, I now count them as nothing compared to knowing the freedom and confidence that Jesus has given me as I now know him as the true representation of God, a God who fully knows, loves, and embraces each one of us just as we are.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a fast car, I want a ticket to anywhere&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been a pop music fan at some point in the last 35 years, you&rsquo;re probably now hearing an acoustic guitar riff in your head. Tracy Chapman&rsquo;s song Fast Car came out in 1988 and was a Top 10 hit. It&rsquo;s a wonderful song.</p>
<p>I heard Fast Car for the first time about 3 months ago when a social media post linking to a YouTube of Chapman playing the song in front of a restless crowd at Wembley Stadium came across my feed.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/teZsA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I listened to it, mostly impressed at a 24-year-old enthralling a huge crowd with nothing but an acoustic guitar and a microphone. I was probably doing something else at my desk at the time, and didn&rsquo;t really listen to the words.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when my wife and I were out for a weekend and had dinner on a bar patio listening to a guy play acoustic covers. He played Fast Car. I mentioned to my wife that I&rsquo;d never really heard the song before a month or two ago. She was incredulous. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know this song?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s about that time in any such conversation that my insecurity and shame creeps in.</p>
<p>I grew up in a fundamentalist homeschooling household where we weren&rsquo;t allowed to listen to &ldquo;secular music&rdquo;. Classical was OK, and the Christian radio station was fine when it played softer stuff (and tolerated when it played &ldquo;rockier&rdquo; stuff), but other than that, nope. By the time I was 17 or 18 and had my own car I could turn on whatever radio station I wanted, but by that time the legalism was pretty well engrained in my young soul and my only comfortable dalliance with &ldquo;secular music&rdquo; was the old-time country music I played on the piano as part of the impromptu band at Rinky Tink&rsquo;s ice cream shop during open mic nights.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re my age (mid-40s), all that music you grew up hearing in the late 80s and early 90s? I know none of it. Michael Jackson may as well not exist for me. I was scandalized by my cousin&rsquo;s U2 <em>Achtung Baby</em> poster, both because it was a &ldquo;secular&rdquo; rock band (joke&rsquo;s on me: they&rsquo;re probably the most Christian rock band of the last 40 years) and because it had the word &ldquo;baby&rdquo; on the poster, which undoubtedly referred to some girl they were interested in, and being interested in girls was wrong until you were old enough to get married.</p>
<p>I was a lonely 12-year-old, and 13-year-old, and heck was just without friends and pretty lonely for a lot of my teenage years. I was 12 years old and desperate enough for help that I called in to donate my own hard-earned funds to the Christian radio pledge drive when the reward premium was Charles Stanley&rsquo;s book <em>How to Handle Adversity</em>. I anxiously waited for the book to show up, convinced it&rsquo;d have answers for me. When it finally did, I read what the good reverend from Atlanta suggested: 1) Pray. (Check, been doing that lots.) 2) Lean on friends for support. Well&hellip; shit.</p>
<p>I still looked to music to soothe my soul, but the music I listened to as that angsty just-barely-a-teen was music that told me everything would be OK and you shouldn&rsquo;t really feel sad because God. (Glad&rsquo;s song Be Ye Glad and Steve Camp&rsquo;s Love That Will Not Let Me Go come to mind.) There was eventually some CCM music that hinted at it being OK to be angsty - Michael W Smith sang Emily (&ldquo;on the wire/balancing your dreams/hoping ends will meet their means/but you feel alone/uninspired/but does it help you to/know that I believe in you?&quot;) and then later on a duet with Amy Grant on Somewhere, Somehow (&ldquo;somehow far beyond today/I will find a way to find you&rdquo;) - but I felt ashamed to listen to them and feel that way. (They&rsquo;re still guilty pleasures.)</p>
<p>I signed up for Columbia House Music Club when I was 17 and somehow snuck in a Bryan Adams best of CD. I presume I only knew his name because his Everything I Do (I Do It For You) song was a big enough hit it got played at my (apparently not quite so fundamentalist but still fundy enough we sang Christianized lyrics to Friends in Low Places in chapel) summer camp. Adams' songs rocked (which I loved) but shocked me and had me feeling bad about listening to them. OK, a song like Kids Wanna Rock was ok because it was just about restless kids. But Run To You was about&hellip; sex. We can&rsquo;t be talking about that, now. Nope. Skip the track.</p>
<p>It took me well into my 20s to finally let myself listen more broadly to &ldquo;secular&rdquo; music, my fundamentalist self surprised to find that Bono was a Christian and U2 was singing amazing stuff, that Win Butler was wrestling with his own spiritual ghosts in his songs for Arcade Fire, that it was OK to just enjoy music that wasn&rsquo;t written about God because it was good music. And in some ways it was fun to have so much music backlog to discover, since aside from Simon and Garfunkel I didn&rsquo;t really know much of anything of pop music.</p>
<p>But it also means that, for a music guy, I&rsquo;ve got these big gaps of music knowledge that I&rsquo;m ashamed of. I try to soak in as much information as I can so I don&rsquo;t appear to be uninformed, but that façade only lasts so long.</p>
<p>Part of me doesn&rsquo;t really want to hit publish on this post, because eventually my Dad will read it, and he&rsquo;ll apologize again. As he&rsquo;s realized the past couple years how much damage that fundamentalism did to all of us he&rsquo;s been really broken by it, and apologized over and over. I&rsquo;ve forgiven him. I&rsquo;m a dad, too, and have already had to apologize to my kids for the damage that kind of Christianity did to them before I came to my own realization. (I am glad, though, that they&rsquo;ve grown up with Coldplay and Adele and Arcade Fire and then felt the freedom to find their own music regardless of what genre label it falls under. We&rsquo;re slowly undoing that mess.) But aside from guilt and forgiveness, I am finding that to start to heal I have to acknowledge the pain of that teenage boy. It was real. It shaped who I am today in a ton of ways.</p>

<p>You got a fast car<br>
I got a plan to get us outta here<br>
I been working at the convenience store<br>
Managed to save just a little bit of money<br>
Won&rsquo;t have to drive too far<br>
Just &lsquo;cross the border and into the city<br>
You and I can both get jobs<br>
And finally see what it means to be living</p>
<p>You got a fast car<br>
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?<br>
We gotta make a decision<br>
Leave tonight or live and die this way</p>
<p>So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car<br>
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk<br>
City lights lay out before us<br>
And your arm felt nice wrapped &lsquo;round my shoulder<br>
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged<br>
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Lyrics from Fast Car by Tracy Chapman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13-year-old Chris would&rsquo;ve felt every word of this song. Would&rsquo;ve felt less alone, knowing that other people experienced the same ache. But Chris didn&rsquo;t get to listen to that song when he was 13. And Chris didn&rsquo;t stop and really listen to this song until this morning. Which is why 46-year-old grown man Chris is sitting at his desk this morning in tears, listening to Fast Car on repeat.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been thinking tonight about two ministers who spent a lot of the 20th century on TV, and the difference in reactions from the public when they died.</p>
<p>Fred Rogers was a minister who saw his calling to children and spent his life sharing messages of love, acceptance, and inclusion. He didn’t invoke God’s name on his program, but God’s love oozed out of him on every episode. When he passed away his loss was universally mourned by millions who knew somehow what love looked like because they had experienced Mr. Rogers on TV.</p>
<p>Pat Robertson was a minister who spent his life on TV leveraging his faith to try to accumulate power. He ran for President once, and spent his final decades on TV proclaiming a judgmental God who sends catastrophes to punish America for the “sins” that fundamentalist Republicans hate. He blamed pagans, feminists, and gays for bringing on the 9/11 attacks, and America’s abortion policy for Hurricane Katrina. He died yesterday and his death has been loudly celebrated across social media. The damage he did to Christianity and the name of Jesus is incalculable.</p>
<p>While I’m glad that Robertson is done wreaking damage on this earth, I don’t want to celebrate his (or anyone’s) death. I believe God’s love extends to all, and that eventually all will accept it. Some will just have a lot more reshaping, reforming, and repenting to do as they come to understand the real fullness and richness of God’s love. Given the choice, emulate Fred Rogers, not Pat Robertson.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2023/05/30/billionaire-hoarders-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-05-30 19:00:00 -0500">May 30, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">

<p>I re-posted a meme to Facebook the other day which suggested that billionaires are “hoarders”, likening them to a “human dragon sleeping on their piles of rubies and gold”. Someone popped up to dispute this characterization, making the following assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Billionaires are quite philanthropic. Sure, this is a general statement, but check it out.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The reason billionaires are billionaires is that, generally, they work extraordinarily hard to invest their capital using wisdom while calculating risks.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, there were other assertions and comments, but these two were enough to not pass my smell test. My immediate inclination was that (a) most billionaires aren’t particularly charitable, and (b) most of them have gotten that rich by running exploitive companies - either exploiting natural resources or human beings, or both.</p>
<p>Rather than just go with the smell test, though, I decided to do a first-level investigation and summarize what I found. To do this, I took the Top 10 off the current <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/">Forbes 400</a> list. These guys (and they’re all guys) are all household names, each worth $60B or more. (Yes, that’s billion with a B.) To put $60B in context, if you got $80,000 <em>per day</em>, every day, since Jesus was born, neglecting any inflation or earnings on that money, you would just have gotten to $60B this year. That’s a staggering amount of money.</p>
<p>For each one of these guys I am summarizing their current net worth, reported charitable giving, and how they made their fortune. Spoiler alert: it’s not a pretty picture. Let’s go.</p>
<h3 id="1-elon-musk">#1: Elon Musk</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth</strong>: $167.6B</p>
<p><strong>Charitable giving</strong>: in 2022 he donated $160M, the most ever! <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/12/12/elon-musk-gave-5-7-billion-to-charity-last-year-where-it-went-was-a-mystery-until-now/">Fortune also reports</a> he gave $5.7B to a foundation, but it’s under his control and hasn’t actually been disbursed anywhere yet. That $160M is <em>less than 0.01%</em> of his net worth. Even the $5.7B is only 3% of his net worth… seems unimpressive.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> mostly from Tesla. How much his own work and skills contributed to the company’s growth is up for debate, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/madelinehalpert/2022/06/17/musk-sued-over-teslas-alleged-toxic-workplace-just-the-latest-in-a-rough-week/?sh=64a94e197dcd">Tesla and Musk have been sued for running a toxic, discriminatory, abusive workplace on multiple occasions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-jeff-bezos">#2: Jeff Bezos</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $120B</p>
<p>Bezos has in theory pledged to give his money away, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23553730/jeff-bezos-philanthropy-giving-pledge-charity">reports say it’s unclear</a> whether he is actually doing that. The biggest documented donation I saw reported was $100M to Dolly Parton’s foundation. Which, to be fair, is a noble cause, but $100M is only 0.08% of Bezos’ net worth.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> Amazon, of course. You don’t have to search far to find multitudes of reports of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/10/25/a-hard-hitting-investigative-report-into-amazon-shows-that-workers-needs-were-neglected-in-favor-of-getting-goods-delivered-quickly/?sh=46c1037851f5">Amazon’s abusive practices to their employees</a>. Maybe not such a good guy, either.</p>
<h3 id="3-bill-gates">#3: Bill Gates</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $106B</p>
<p>Credit where credit is due: Gates has already given more than $50B of his fortune to the Gates Foundation, and that Foundation is doing significant work around the world in important causes. Bravo, sir.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> Microsoft. As in, he wrote the original MS-DOS, and just managed to hit the wave of computers in an unprecedented and unrepeatable way.</p>
<h3 id="4-larry-ellison">#4: Larry Ellison</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $101B</p>
<p>Ellison <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23553730/jeff-bezos-philanthropy-giving-pledge-charity">reportedly is struggling</a> to figure out how to give his money away. So far his reported donations are all in the $100 - $200M range (0.1% - 0.2% of his net worth). (He apparently found it easier to spend $300M to <a href="https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2022/06/12/billionaire-ellison-turning-hawaiis-lanai-into-playground-for-the-rich/#">buy an entire Hawaiian island</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> Oracle databases. And then a lot of big finance and investing.</p>
<h3 id="5-warren-buffett">#5: Warren Buffett</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $97B</p>
<p>Here’s the other bright light on this list. Lifetime Buffett <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/06/14/warren-buffett-just-gave-another-4-billion-to-charity/?sh=5fd09ff32f9e">has given away almost $50B</a>, largely to the Gates Foundation. However, his wealth is growing “faster than he can give it away”.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> investments. If there’s one guy on this list who meets the “a lot of hard work and wise investing” criteria that my interlocutor set out, Buffett is probably that guy.</p>
<h3 id="6-larry-page">#6: Larry Page</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $93B</p>
<p>It is reported that he has <a href="https://observer.com/2023/05/larry-page-foundation-donor-advised-funds-6-7-billion/">funded his foundation to $6B</a>, but most of it is in donor-advised funds for later donation, and while the tax breaks have kicked in now, the money hasn’t actually gone to any good use yet. That same article is touting donations to actual charities in the $100k (yes, that’s a K) range, which is, oh, <em>0.0001% of his net worth</em>. Color me unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>How did he make his money:</strong> he co-founded a little company called Google. So some of that I’m willing to attribute to just hitting the right tech at the right time, similar to Gates and Ellison. But Google’s money-making methods continue to get nastier every time you look - the incessant ads, the deep user tracking, the toxic YouTube algorithms that are <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opis-2020-0007/pdf">happy to feed you fascist content if it’s what keeps you watching</a>… not particularly honorable.</p>
<h3 id="7-sergey-brin">#7: Sergey Brin</h3>
<p>2022 net worth: $89B</p>
<p>Brin has <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2022/2/2/sergey-brins-off-the-radar-foundation-is-huge-and-growing-fast-heres-what-we-know-about-it">given maybe $1B over the past 10 years</a> to his own foundation (which is beneficial for tax purposes), and of that billion, the biggest chunk, almost $200M has gone to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s research. A noble cause, yes… but only donating 1% of his net worth over the past 10 years? Peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> He’s the other half of Google. (See #6.)</p>
<h3 id="8-steve-ballmer">#8: Steve Ballmer</h3>
<p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $83B</p>
<p>Ballmer’s foundation breathlessly announced a $217M donation in 2022, which is to say they are going to offer grants on the topic of climate change. That appears to be the biggest chunk Steve has donated anywhere. That’s 0.25% of his net worth, which I guess is a little more than Sergey Brin gave to the Fox Foundation, but still… it ain’t much.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> Ballmer was in early following Bill Gates into Microsoft. If only he were so quick to follow in Gates’ footsteps when it comes to giving his money away.</p>
<h3 id="9-michael-bloomberg">#9: Michael Bloomberg</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $78B</p>
<p>Bloomberg also deserves some credit here. He has donated <a href="https://observer.com/2023/04/michael-bloomberg-donate-bloomberg-to-a-philanthropic-foundation/">as much as $14.4 B lifetime</a> (18% of his current net worth) to his personal foundation, and that foundation has actually dispersed significant funds, including $1.7B in 2022. He has also given nearly $3B in donations to his <em>alma mater</em>, Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> he started in investing, and then jumped on the integration of computers and investing in the early 1980s. He branched out into other areas of financial market reporting, but then has also taken detours into politics, serving as the mayor of New York City from 2002 - 2013.</p>
<h3 id="10-jim-walton">#10: Jim Walton</h3>
<p><strong>2022 net worth:</strong> $58B</p>
<p>In 2019 Walton made his first significant donation to charity - $1.2B <a href="https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/jim-walton-donates-walmart-shares-worth-1.2-billion">to (naturally) the Walton Family Foundation</a>. That Foundation has done some good stuff in Arkansas, so credit where credit is due there. But $1.2B on a net worth of $58B is still only 2% as a donation, which feels paltry.</p>
<p><strong>How he made his money:</strong> he inherited it. (As did his siblings, who are #12 and #15 on the Forbes 400 list.) And how does Walmart continue to turn profits? Well, among other things, by mistreating their employees. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Walmart">Wages below the poverty level. Poor working conditions. Unlawful termination. Union busting.</a> Maybe $1B for art and education in Arkansas can assuage your conscience? Jim can only hope so.</p>
<h2 id="lets-sum-up">Let’s sum up</h2>
<p>So, the Top 10. “Quite philanthropic”. “Work very hard” and made admirable business decisions. Really?</p>
<p>“Quite philanthropic” - I think we can safely put that label on Gates, Buffett, and Bloomberg. Many of the others have made pledges that their money will be given away before or at their death, but that isn’t doing anybody any good <em>now</em>. So, 3 out of 10. Not great, Bob!</p>
<p>“Work very hard and made wise business decisions” - I mean, at some level if you want to lionize people playing the capitalism game to come out ahead, by definition these guys have all done that. But if you want to put some sort of moral filter on it, asking whether their gains are well-gotten or not, I think we could safely chalk up Musk, Bezos, Page, Brin, and Walton in the exploitive category. I can’t say I’m very impressed with Ballmer, either, but Microsoft isn’t ugly and predatory in quite the same way that Walmart, Amazon, and Google are.</p>
<p>You do you, Facebook friend, but to my eyes, it’s not a stretch to see these guys as dragons sleeping on piles of gold and gems while <a href="https://www.worldvision.org/sponsorship-news-stories/global-poverty-facts#:~:text=BACK%20TO%20QUESTIONS-,How%20many%20people%20live%20in%20poverty%20around%20the%20world%3F,in%20poverty%20as%20of%202021.">10% of the world lives in extreme poverty</a>.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-more-back-of-the-envelope-math">A little more back-of-the-envelope math</h3>
<p>Just for fun, let’s imagine the top income tax bracket from the 1950s (by all accounts, a wonderful time that a lot of people want to go back to) was in place for these guys. That bracket was 91%. And let’s just do the math on their current net worth. All up the wealth of the Top 10 here and it comes out to $994B. Take that times 91% and you come up with $904.5B which would be in the US Treasury. Now, we can quibble about how wisely the US Government spends its money… that’s for another time. But the US budget deficit last year was $1.4T. So, a tax on just the top 10 wealthiest men in the country would take care of more than two-thirds of the deficit. Yes, that’s just for one year. Adjustments still need to be made. But the wealth of these privileged few, even in the scope of the national economy, is, to quote a famous cartoon moose, “antihistamine money”: not to be sneezed at.</p>

			 <p>Seeing as I&rsquo;ve got 4 months before I need to do any international travel, and 10 months before my passport expires, it&rsquo;s time to get it renewed. Whether I&rsquo;m well-organized or just consistent in my laziness, when I got a new passport picture taken and received 2 copies, the extra copy went into my desk drawer right on top of my two previous passport pictures. <a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/03/24/the-difference-a-decade-makes/">Ten years ago I presented the first two for comparison.</a> Today I add the third. When presented together they comprise a triptych of an aging man.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wp-content/551/2023/05/IMG_9632-1024x348.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the left-most photo I&rsquo;m probably 26. I have hair (which is thinning on top, but you can&rsquo;t see that!), no beard, and still a baby face. I&rsquo;m still a year away from having children and looking like what a friend once described as an East German android.</p>
<p>The center photo has me at age 36. The hair is gone, the goatee (technically a Van Dyke, but who&rsquo;s counting?) in place, casually dressed with what is undoubtedly a Cubs t-shirt under my jacket.</p>
<p>The right-hand side is me yesterday, age 46. I can see the age starting to set in. Head still shaved, beard full and a lot greyer, back to a polo shirt. I have a pic somewhere on my phone from a few years ago where I was messing around with one of those artificial aging apps. I&rsquo;m now inclined to think it was fairly accurate, because I can see myself getting there. Also, I resemble my dad more than I often think I do.</p>
<p>Who knows what the next decade will bring?</p>

			 <p>danah boyd has <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2023/04/10/protect-elders-ban-television.html">a <em>fantastic</em> piece</a> out today about the current furor to ban teens from social media, saying basically that (a) it&rsquo;s complicated, and (b) it&rsquo;s more about control than it is helping teens. A brief taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does social media <em>cause</em> mental health problems? Or is it where mental health problems become visible? I can guarantee you that there are examples of both. But here’s the thing…. Going to school and church are often a “cause” of mental health duress. Parents and siblings are often a source of mental health duress. No one in their right mind would argue that we need to prevent all youth from attending school or church or living with their parents or siblings. We take a more tempered approach because there are also very real situations in which we need to remove <em>some</em> children from <em>some</em> environments (namely abusive ones).</p>
<p>So why do we want to remove ALL children from social media?</p>
<p>This is a story of control, not a story of protecting the well-being of children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>danah is one of the foremost voices to listen to these days regarding the social impact of technology, particularly its impact on teenagers. This reminds me I should go read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300166311/apophenia-20">her most recent book</a>, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not some meditative communion with God that I crave. What one wants during extreme crisis is not connection with God, but connection with people; not supernatural love, but human love. No, that is not quite right. What one craves is supernatural love, but one finds it only within human love.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This is why I am, such as I am, a Christian, because I can feel God only through physical existence, can feel his love only in the love of other people. I believe in grace and chance, at the same time. I believe in absolute truth and absolute contingency, at the same time. And I believe that Christ is the seam soldering together these wholes that our half vision — and our entire clock-bound, logic-locked way of life — shapes as polarities.

<p>Beautiful, and it resonates for me with the stuff I was reading from Chris Green a couple weeks ago — that the world experiences God’s love through us in the way God makes space for them in our lives.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m still only in chapter 2 of <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3xiJq4y">Sanctifying Interpretation</a></em>, but this is too good to not share. Green takes a look at the Beatitudes and how Jesus embodies them. Then, he says, the Beatitudes show themselves to be concerned with power, though not perhaps in the way you’d think:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can say that true power - the power of the Spirit of holiness (Rom. 1.4) - is first and foremost the power of unanxious and reconciling presence, a power brought to bear on behalf of those who suffer in isolation, those forgotten or ignored by the powers-that-be, whose only hope is ‘another body that comes and stands beside and in the midst… and will not move’. As our lives are made in even the smallest ways to be like Christ’s, we become noticeably less anxious, less needy, less defensive, and increasingly determined for others to be treated with the dignity that is theirs as God’s delight.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sanctifying Interpretation, p. 39</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there’s something the church today needs to learn, this may be exactly it: to be less anxious, less needy, less defensive, and more for others. What a word.</p>
<p>Green continues, drawing on Stanley Hauerwas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To this end, the church must be ‘a body of people who have learned the skills of presence’, skills that are developed only in a community ‘pledged not to fear the stranger’, where the practice of being present with those in suffering ‘has become the marrow of their habits’…
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sometimes the Spirit limns [colors, like a highlighter] our actions so that they body forth the power of Christ’s compassion and wisdom in ways that we and others can sense. But whether we or they can sense it or not, <strong>our confidence in God leads us to say that he is always everywhere at work doing good</strong>. So, by being there, but showing up and staying put, we ‘present our bodies as a living sacrifice’ (Rom. 12.1-2), which, when all is said and done, is probably the only way that truly overcomes evil with good (Rom. 12.21). Thus, that is the sacrifice with which God is pleased.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
We often wrongly imagine sacrifice not as a gift but as forfeiture, not as self-giving but as self-destruction. Christ, however, reveals that <strong>God hates whatever destroys us, just as surely as he hates whatever we might do that destroys others.</strong> And, as the last sacrifice, his priestly ministry is the apocalyptic bringing-to-bear of the Great Commandment, which is why his sacrifice is the end of all sacrifice. Christ makes of himself a sacrifices, and so <strong>all sacrifices, if they are true to themselves must be what his was: a free and freeing gift of reconciliation and healing and blessing</strong>.</p>
<p>Sanctifying Interpretation, p. 40</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have felt both sides of this at times - the feeling that “showing up and staying put” is a sacrifice that is sometimes too much, to the point of my own detriment. Green says, though, that God wants us to stay put in ways that are reconciling, healing, and blessing to ourselves as well as those we are serving.</p>

<p>Often, when we are talking about the church as called out from the world, we imply a contrast between the humanity of believers and the humanity of non-believers. Truth be told, Scripture itself often seems to speak this way. For example, Ephesians 2 contrasts ‘the children of wrath’ - those who are ‘dead’ in sin, ‘following the course of the world’, dominated by the ‘passions of the flesh’ (Eph 2.1-3) - with the ‘one new humanity’, which is created in Christ’s body as the ‘household of God’ (Eph. 2.15, 19). If we are not careful, then, we leave the impression that the saints have a different humanity ‘in Christ’ than does the rest of the world ‘in Adam’.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<strong>But such a reading misses the point.</strong> The line of thought in Ephesians 2 does not end with the contrast between the family of God and the children of disobedience. Instead, Paul goes on to insist that this ‘one new humanity’ constituted in and as Christ’s body ‘is joined together and grows into a holy temple… a dwelling place for God’ (Eph. 2.21-22). <strong>What is this temple if not a holy ‘place’ set aside for the world to meet with its God and for God to act on the world?</strong> The church, participating in the renewed humanity created in Christ as a priestly people, opens a space in the midst of the world so that heaven and earth, the new creation and the old, can touch. <strong>We are made by the Spirit the temple for the sake of others, so they can encounter Christ in the room he has made for them in our lives.</strong>

</blockquote>
<p>That last sentence is a feast! It’s not a new teaching, or anything contradictory to things I’ve been taught before, but that particular color on it: that others would “encounter Christ” when they encounter me. Wowza.</p>

			 <p>I’m just digging in to Chris E. W. Green’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3IitBB0">Sanctifying Interpretation</a></em>, and while it’s a book I picked up because it was going to address Scriptural interpretation, I’m only two chapters in and blown away by his thoughts on human vocation. I’ve got several bits I’d like to share, but I’ll spread them out over several posts.</p>
<p>From Chapter 1, Green encourages us that the <em>Christian</em> vocation shouldn’t be distinguished too strongly from the <em>human</em> vocation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that a call to collaborate with God rests upon <em>all</em> of us just because we exist as the creatures we are. We are all of us as human beings made to mediate God’s holiness to the rest of creation, to work the works of God, to do what Jesus did, to be who Jesus is. To be human is to be burdened with this vocation. And in many ways - small and large, conscious and unconscious, intentional and inadvertent - all of us are more or less faithfully and lovingly in fact fulfilling our calling, although always only in part. In Christ, the Spirit places us under that burden, strengthening us for the bearing of it…
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sanctifying Interpretation, p. 20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this thought that humans, even unknowingly, are frequently ‘faithfully and lovingly’ fulfilling the calling as humans to bring healing and reconciliation.</p>
<p>Green goes on to talk about the purpose of Christian vocation as something clarified or revealed from within the human vocation (emphasis mine in the quote below):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Our broadest vocation is not so much given to us at our baptism as we are at last truly given to it.</strong> Baptized into Christ, we are awakened to and sanctioned for the vocation we always already were meant to bear. Our narrower vocation - the work we are called to do as members of Christ’s body (e.g. bishop, pastor, or deacon; evangelist intercession, or teacher) - comes to us in our call to believe or is imparted to us in the event of ordination, but <strong>always with a view to the fulfillment of the natural human call</strong>. Within such an account, those outside the church are recognized to have the same broad vocation we do. For now, however, we find ourselves called out from them, but <strong>only because we have been singled out by God to share in the work of making room <em>for</em> them</strong>. <strong>We take on the ecclesial vocation always only on behalf of others - never instead of them, much less against them</strong>. We are the called out ones whose lives are dedicated entirely to collaboration with God’s work for those who have yet to hear or submit to the call. <strong>The elect are always elected for the sake of the non-elect. The church is a remnant of the world, gathered from the world to be both a temple and a kingdom of priests for the world’s sake.</strong><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sanctifying Interpretation, p. 21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such a wonderful perspective. Would that the church saw their vocation, their service to God, never instead of others or against others, but always <em>for the sake of</em> others. The picture of the church as a temple and priests to bring God’s presence and message to the world, and the world to God’s presence and message, is one I’ll be chewing on for a while.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2023/01/23/on-leaving-twitter.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-01-23 19:00:00 -0500">Jan 23, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I joined Twitter back before it was a social media juggernaut. I don&rsquo;t remember how many years ago that was, but I blogged about it back at least as far as 2007&hellip; which was a long time ago. Twitter was the social network that allowed me to make friends, meet interesting people, learn and grow&hellip; also to get irrationally angry, unduly stressed, and unnecessarily anxious at times. Learning how to use it for my own improvement and not to my own detriment was a continuous process.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s decline over the past few months under Elon Musk&rsquo;s ownership has been well documented. Functionality was axed. Content moderation staffs were fired. Longstanding rules were set aside on the boss&rsquo;s whim. Nazis had their suspensions lifted. Third party apps (the only way I used the service, anyway) were cut off without any notice or announcement. The reasons to be done with Twitter grow more numerous every day.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t closed down my Twitter account, since closing it releases the username back to the wild. Not that I&rsquo;m so well known that my username is desirable for someone else to take up, but still. But I locked the account down, deleted the apps from my devices, and just don&rsquo;t go to Twitter in my browser any more.</p>
<h2 id="enter-mastodon">Enter Mastodon</h2>
<p>I was an early adopter of Mastodon, too - at least as far as creating an account back in 2019 when it released, then forgetting all about it. When the Twitter shenanigans started I decided to dive into the fediverse in earnest. I&rsquo;ve written previously about setting up and administering a small Mastodon instance at <a href="https://iowadon.org">IowaDon.org</a>. It&rsquo;s humming along with about a dozen active users. That doesn&rsquo;t sound like many (and it isn&rsquo;t), but thanks to the magic of the fediverse, we interact with hundreds of thousands of other users who are members of other Mastodon servers around the world.</p>
<p>Mastodon has largely replaced Twitter as my daily social media tool. Some of my old Twitter network came across and we reconnected; I&rsquo;ve also found a bunch of new interesting folks to follow. There are still a few people who haven&rsquo;t made their way from Twitter to Mastodon who I really miss. Here&rsquo;s hoping one of these days they also make the jump.</p>
<h2 id="app-recommendation-ivory">App Recommendation: Ivory</h2>
<p>Finally, a practical suggestion if you&rsquo;re an Apple user. For years I used an app called Tweetbot to browse Twitter. Tweetbot was one of the third-party apps that got summarily dispatched without notice a couple weeks ago when Elon pulled their plug. The developers of Tweetbot cranked up their efforts on a Mastodon app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6444602274">Ivory</a>, and it released today. I&rsquo;ve been using it in beta for a few weeks now and it&rsquo;s excellent. I happily subscribed at the highest level (don&rsquo;t worry, dear, it&rsquo;s only $25/year) as soon as I downloaded the released version today. Developers gotta eat, too, and for an app I use every day, 7 cents per day seems like a pittance. If you&rsquo;re using an iPhone or an iPad and want to use Mastodon, I&rsquo;d highly recommend it. (There are lower-priced subscription levels if that is a hindrance.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to new platforms and new (and old!) friends. If you&rsquo;re in the fediverse already, you can follow me at <a href="https://iowadon.org/@cjhubbs">@cjhubbs@iowadon.org</a>. You can follow my blog at <a href="https://iowadon.org/@chris@chrishubbs.com">@chris@chrishubbs.com</a>, too! And if you&rsquo;d just like to give Mastodon a try, you&rsquo;re welcome to sign up for an account at iowadon.org!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve tracked my reading in one way or another here on this site and then using Goodreads since 2007 or so. At some point Goodreads got bought by Amazon and its functionality stagnated; I&rsquo;m still logging books there but not interested in investing in it as my continued long-term logging. I was casting around for ideas on book logging back during the holidays and ran across some spiffy static site generator ideas, which lead me to rolling out <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com">The Bookshelf</a> at <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com">books.chrishubbs.com</a> today.</p>
<p>The vast bulk of the functionality driving The Bookshelf was written by Tobias (aka Rixx), who maintains his own book logging site at <a href="https://books.rixx.de/">books.rixx.de</a>. He provides the source on Github. It was designed to scrape Goodreads for data, assuming that the user would have Goodreads Developer API keys. Goodreads no longer issues new developer API keys (stagnating, remember?) so that path wasn&rsquo;t available. I ended up writing some Python to parse the Goodreads export CSV file (which contained all of my reading logs since 2007) and process it into a whole structure of Markdown files with associated metadata. Those are then the master data that Rixx&rsquo;s site generator tools use to generate static HTML.</p>
<p>I love the layout and organization of The Bookshelf. You can look at reading <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com/reviews/">by year</a>, <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com/reviews/by-author/">by author</a>, <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com/reviews/by-title/">by title</a>, and <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com/reviews/by-series/">by series</a>. You can also look at <a href="https://books.chrishubbs.com/stats/">statistics</a> on titles and pages read. There is &ldquo;to be read&rdquo; functionality that is a bit raggedy-looking yet; I have plans to add my existing to-read bookshelf (above my dresser in my bedroom!) to The Bookshelf as To Read, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten that done yet.</p>
<p>If history serves, The Bookshelf will be the most actively updated part of my website. I haven&rsquo;t done a great job over the years at writing short book reviews, but I think this site and the workflow to update it will encourage me to do that. I&rsquo;m sure a decade from now it&rsquo;ll be time for a change to something else, but as an organizer and cataloger, I&rsquo;m excited to have 15 years worth of reading data here.</p>

<p>I got through 61 books this year, which feels like a bit of a down year. My &ldquo;one book at a time&rdquo; practice got me bogged down in some slow theology books, and then I got sucked into a cross-stitch project and a couple web projects at the end of the year which stole some of my reading time. (I finally came to grips with breaking up the long theology slogs with some fiction, and that helps a lot.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full list of reading, with particular standouts noted in bold:</p>
<h2 id="theology">Theology</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Heavy Burdens: Seven Ways LGBTQ Christians Experience Harm in the Church</em> - Bridget Eileen Rivera</li>
<li><em>Happiness and Contemplation</em> - Josef Pieper</li>
<li><em>The Aryan Jesus</em> - Susannah Heschel</li>
<li><em>The Joy of Being Wrong</em> - James Alison</li>
<li><em>Attached to God: A Practical Guide to Deeper Spiritual Experience</em> - Krispin Mayfield</li>
<li><strong><em>The Emergent Christ</em> - Ilia Delio</strong></li>
<li><em>The Beatitudes Through the Ages</em> - Rebekah Ann Eklund</li>
<li><em>Let the Light In: Healing from Distorted Images of God</em> - Colin McCartney</li>
<li><em>In: Incarnation and Inclusion, Abba and Lamb</em> - Brad Jersak</li>

<li><em>Destined for Joy</em> - Alvin F. Kimel</li>
<li><em>A Thicker Jesus</em> - Glen Harold Stassen</li>
<li><em>Changing Our Mind</em> - David P. Gushee</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Ilia Delio&rsquo;s <em>The Emergent Christ</em> is the one that had me thinking the most this year, and that will stick with me longer than any of the others. Her approach to thinking about God, evolution, and universal progress within a Christian framework blew my mind, and consistently challenges me to think about God and the universe differently.</p>

</ul>
<p><img src="/images/2023/strangers-in-their-own-land.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Three women&rsquo;s books stand out here: Tara Isabella Burton&rsquo;s <em>Strange Rites</em>, looking at how the current generation of young people are looking for religious experiences in places other than traditional religion; Cole Arthur Riley&rsquo;s spiritual memoir <em>This Here Flesh</em>, and Arlie Russell Hochschild&rsquo;s <em>Strangers in Their Own Land</em>, describing a sociologist&rsquo;s quest to understand Louisianans who have been devastatingly impacted by environmental destruction and yet persistently support the businesses and political causes behind that destruction.</p>
<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Unthinkable</em> - Brad Parks</li>
<li><em>Lent</em> - Jo Walton</li>
<li><em>The Last Commandment</em> - Scott Shepherd</li>
<li><em>When We Cease To Understand the World</em> - Benjamin Labatut</li>
<li><em>Everything Sad Is Untrue</em> - Daniel Nayeri</li>
<li><em>Once A Thief</em> - Christopher Reich</li>
<li><em>A Deadly Education</em> - Naomi Novik</li>
<li><em>The Blue Diamond</em> - Leonard Goldberg</li>
<li><strong><em>A Psalm for the Wild-Built</em> - Becky Chambers</strong></li>
<li><em>The Coffin Dancer</em> - Jeffery Deaver</li>
<li><em>Sea of Tranquility</em> - Emily St. John Mandel</li>
<li><em>Small Things Like These</em> - Claire Keegan</li>
<li><strong><em>A Prayer for the Crown-Shy</em> - Becky Chambers</strong></li>
<li><em>A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</em> - Becky Chambers (re-read)</li>
<li><em>Slow Horses</em> - Mick Herron</li>
<li><em>The Last Agent</em> - Robert Dugoni</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/2023/psalm-wild-built.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here the standout was author Becky Chambers. Her little Monk &amp; Robot novellas sucked me in and made me happy. That prompted me to purchase her Small Angry Planet series and start in on a re-read. Chambers works in the best tradition of science fiction pushing for inclusion and acceptance of The Other and in using the exploration of a very different universe to make you think about how our own could be improved.</p>
<h2 id="coming-up">Coming Up&hellip;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to log on Goodreads this past year but I get the feeling it&rsquo;s spooling down as it gets absorbed by Amazon. I&rsquo;m working on a self-hosted book logging site - it&rsquo;s actually live online right now if you know where to look but I&rsquo;m going to do some cleanup on it before I publicize it. I&rsquo;ll post here about it when I do!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2022/12/30/stanley-hauerwas-on.html">Stanley Hauerwas on sin, character formation, and fear</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2022/12/30/stanley-hauerwas-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-12-30 14:35:07 -0500">Dec 30, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From Chapter 3 of Stanley Hauerwas’ book on Christian ethics <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3VC6u8b">The Peaceable Kingdom</a></em>, this wonderful insight into how we can think about sin as interacting with our own power, control, and self-direction (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are rooted in sin just to the extent we think we have the inherent power to claim our life - our character - as our particular achievement. In other words, our sin - our fundamental sin - is the assumption that we are the creators of the history through which we acquire and possess our character. <strong>Sin is the form our character takes as a result of our fear that we will be “nobody” if we lose control of our lives.</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Moreover our need to be in control is the basis for the violence of our lives. For since our “control” and “power” cannot help but be built on an insufficient basis, we must use force to maintain the illusion that we are in control. We are deeply afraid of losing what unity of self we have achieved. Any idea or person threatening that unity must be either manipulated or eliminated…
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
This helps us understand why we are so resistant to the training offered by the gospel, for <strong>we simply cannot believe that the self might be formed without fear of the other</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gets to the heart of a lot of the discussions I’ve had with my Dad lately about the first step in making a positive spiritual change (which might be what Hauerwas here calls “the training offered by the gospel”) is to be freed from fear. One needs to be secure in their standing with God and with their community to be able to change and grow. (The counter-example here is frequently seen: spiritual communities that make any interest in ideas outside the accepted orthodoxy grounds for exclusion and expulsion.)</p>
<p>Hauerwas continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our sin lies precisely in our unbelief - our distrust that we are creatures of a gracious creator known only to the extent we accept the invitation to become part of his kingdom. It is only be learning to make that story - that story of God - our own that we gain the freedom necessary to make our life our own. Only then can I learn to accept what has happened to me (which includes what I have done) without resentment. It is then that I am able to accept my body, my psychological conditioning, my implicit distrust of others and myself, as mine, as part of my story. <strong>And the acceptance of myself as a sinner is made possible only because it is an acceptance of God’s acceptance.</strong> This I am able to see myself as a sinner and yet to go on.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
This does not mean that tragedy is eliminated from our lives; rather we have the means to recognize and accept the tragic without turning to violence. For <strong>finally our freedom is learning how to exist in the world, a violent world, in peace with ourselves and others</strong>. The violence of the world is but the mirror of the violence of our lives. We say we desire peace, but we have not the souls for it. We fear the boredom a commitment to peace would entail. As a result the more we seek to bring “under our control”, the more violent we have to become to protect what we have. And the more violent we allow ourselves to become, the more vulnerable we are to challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is growth toward wholeness: “the means to recognize and accept the tragic without turning to violence”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For what does “peace with ourselves” involve? It surely does not mean that we will live untroubled - though it may be true that no one can really harm a just person. Nor does it mean that we are free of self-conflict, for we remain troubled sinners - indeed, that may well be the best description of the redeemed. <strong>To be “at peace with ourselves” means we have the confidence, gained through participation in the adventure we call God’s kingdom, to trust ourselves and others.</strong> Such confidence becomes the source of our character and our freedom as we are loosed from a debilitating preoccupation with ourselves. Moreover by learning to be at peace with ourselves, we find we can live at peace with one another. And this freedom, after all, is the only freedom worth having.</p>

			 <p>Continuing my adventures hosting <a href="https://iowadon.org">IowaDon.org</a>, a very small Mastodon instance.</p>
<p>When I started hosting IowaDon.org back in early November, I set it up on Linode. I&rsquo;d heard lots of advertisements for their services, and they offered $100 of free credits to try them out for a couple months, so hey, why not? There was also a guide for setting up Mastodon on Linode that <a href="/22/11/setting-up-a-mastodon-instance-on-linode/">turned out to be not quite as smooth as it claimed</a>. (Linode has since <a href="https://www.linode.com/blog/devops/mastodon-server-linode-marketplace/">created a one-click install package</a>, so life may be easier if you tried to start now.) I was not only using Linode&rsquo;s basic server instance ($10/mo for 1 CPU, 2 GB of RAM, 50 GB of storage) but also their object storage ($5/mo for 250 GB of storage, lots of data transfer allowance).</p>
<p>Six weeks later, the object storage continues to seem like a very good deal. Some basic math with the AWS calculator tells me that if I was hosting this same data with this much transfer on Amazon S3, I&rsquo;d be in the $30/month neighborhood. Maybe there would be ways to optimize that, but a flat $5/mo seems like a solid choice going forward.</p>
<p>On the server side, though, $10/mo for the server + $2.50/mo for backups wasn&rsquo;t <em>awful</em>, but I felt like I could do better. I found a recommendation for RackNerd.com, whose <a href="https://www.racknerd.com/BlackFriday/">&ldquo;Black Friday&rdquo; deal is still up</a> and provides a 3 CPU, 4.5 GB RAM, 100 GB SSD storage for $49/year. (I think it was $45/year when I signed up&hellip;) I went ahead and signed up, and within minutes had an IP address and a username and password to login and start working. I had some limited experience with Linux server administration already, but there was still some learning curve here. Fortunately I didn&rsquo;t have a pressing need to move my Mastodon instance, so I could take my time and make sure I was comfortable with how everything was going.</p>

<p>Secure the instance using <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/set-up-and-secure/">Linode&rsquo;s recommended steps</a>. This includes things like setting up SSH keys and disabling password logon, setting up a firewall, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> for VPN connections between my servers and my personal computers and Synology. This has been the most useful piece of the whole puzzle. Again free for my use case, it provides secure WireGuard VPN connections directly between my devices, making login and secure copy very easy. Highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I installed <a href="https://www.netdata.cloud/">Netdata</a> for performance monitoring. It&rsquo;s free for the tier I&rsquo;m using, but it gives me plenty of info on CPU and RAM usage, etc, and will email me if anything goes too wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I played a little bit with setting up a web server (using nginx) and database using Docker images, but that felt like it got complicated fairly quickly without significant benefit. So I jettisoned Docker and natively installed Nginx and Mariadb, and set up <a href="https://www.adminer.org/">Adminer</a> as a single-page database admin interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="migrating-mastodon">Migrating Mastodon</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/migrating/">Mastodon documentation on this</a> is very good. Basically you do a fresh server install per the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/">Mastodon production guide</a> but then stop short of doing the <code>mastodon:setup</code> step. The two key things that need to come over from the old server are the <code>.env.production</code> file (which includes the secret keys) and the database. (This is where using Linode Object Storage helped - I didn&rsquo;t need to move ~100 GB of media files over! They just stayed where they were in object storage.) I dumped the database (ended up about 1.4 GB), copied the dump file over, and imported it on the new server. The .env.production file needed minor updates for the new database connection parameters, but otherwise was good to go.</p>
<p>Everything seemed pretty functional, so then it was time to get DNS pointed over to the new server. I had been pointing at Linode nameservers and managing my DNS settings within Linode, so I had some work to recreate all the DNS entries back over at Hover (my domain registrar of choice). I belatedly realized that I could&rsquo;ve edited the /etc/hosts file on my MacBook to point to the new server to allow me to start testing the site out before DNS resolved&hellip; Next time.</p>
<h2 id="its-never-_quite_-that-easy">It&rsquo;s never <em>quite</em> that easy</h2>
<p>At this point, I could see the Mastodon services were up and running, the server looked like it was happily doing work, and my phone app was connecting up fine. But when I tried to load the web interface it was failing. I asked for help on the Mastodon Discord server and was reminded to look at Nginx configuration. Nginx was indeed throwing errors:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>2022/12/17 10:39:30 [crit] 411144#411144: *1966 stat() &quot;/home/mastodon/live/public/inbox&quot; failed (13: Permission denied), client: 128.199.9.49, server: iowadon.org, request: &quot;POST /inbox HTTP/2.0&quot;, host: &quot;iowadon.org&quot;
</code></pre><p>The helpful person on Discord immediately told me that Nginx wasn&rsquo;t proxying the request to the puma socket&hellip; that gave me someplace to start looking. Puma was running fine, and Nginx was configured to pass the requests along to it.</p>
<p>After about 90 minutes of head-scratching and increasingly-focused googling, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70028324/nginx-permission-denied-accessing-puma-socket-that-does-exist-in-the-correct-loc">I found the answer on Stack Overflow (of course)</a>. Turns out when I had done the very first step, creating the mastodon user on the server, the /home/mastodon folder was set up with 750 permissions (no visibility for basic users). That lack of visibility into the folder for non-mastodon users was causing the problem. A quick <code>chmod o=rx /home/mastodon</code> solved <em>that</em>, and voila! The web interface was up and running.</p>
<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>
<p>One bit that was left hanging at that point was backups. I had been paying Linode to do nightly backups, which appear to be just a snapshot of the full server instance. But I see now that for the Mastodon server, the only things that are critical to backup (again, since all the media is out in the cloud) are the .env.production file and the database dump.</p>
<p>It turns out I have a Synology NAS in my basement with sufficient empty space on it for backups, and Tailscale made it very easy to just rsync the database dump file to my Synology every night. So, I set up a quick cron job to run a database dump and rsync at 2 AM every day. Miracle of miracles, it worked the first time. (It worked the second, third, and fourth times, too&hellip;)</p>
<h2 id="the-aftermath">The aftermath</h2>
<p>Several days into the new server I&rsquo;m happy with the performance. Mastodon is enjoying the extra RAM, the CPU load is quite reasonable (~25% average, maybe), and I have a server instance that I can use for more hosting. I will slowly be moving the several Wordpress sites I run over to this server, which will eventually let me get rid of the hosted service I&rsquo;ve been paying for for a decade. It feels like a good upgrade to me.</p>

			 <p>For a long time my podcast listening has been almost exclusively nerdy tech podcasts mixed up with nerdy theology podcasts, with an occasional news or true crime mixed in to liven things up. Somehow I have almost entirely bypassed any that were music-related. (I did listen to a couple episodes of Song Exploder right after it debuted, but it just didn’t hook me.)</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, <a href="https://twitter.com/RobKendt">Rob Weinert-Kendt</a> on Twitter started linking to <a href="https://500songs.com/"><em>A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs</em></a> by British host Andrew Hickey. It took me only a couple episodes and I was hooked.</p>
<p>The format of the podcast is one song per 30-ish minute episode, but each episode covers far more than just the titular song. Hickey provides background on the artist, the influences that formed that artist, stories about the creation of the song, and so on. You come away from the episode having learned a lot not just about a particular song but also about the developing music scene in the Americas (and, once you get in a ways, in Europe). He starts with the first inklings of what would become rock music as they emerged in the big band scene. (<a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/flying-home-by-the-benny-goodman-sextet/">Episode 1</a>: “Flying Home” by the Benny Goodman Sextet.)</p>
<p>500 episodes is a significant feat for any podcast, and setting out that goal <em>in the title of your show</em> seems rather ambitious, but I’m willing to bet that Mr. Hickey has all 500 songs charted out, and the moxie to see it through. He’s currently up through <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-157-see-emily-play-by-the-pink-floyd/">Episode 157</a> (“See Emily Play” by Pink Floyd), and is publishing a lot of bonus material for <a href="http://patreon.com/andrewhickey">Patreon subscribers</a>. I&rsquo;m learning a lot as I go, so even if some interruption keeps the series from completion, it&rsquo;s still been an excellent investment of time.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re interested in rock music, <em><a href="https://500songs.com">A History of Rock Music in 500 Songs</a></em> is highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had my Mastodon instance (<a href="https://iowadon.org">iowadon.org</a>) up and running for about a week and a half now. It&rsquo;s not grown very large - 10 users or so last time I checked - but it&rsquo;s been a great project to learn some more server admin type stuff.</p>
<p>Ten days and ten users in, my Linode instance seems to quite adequate from a processing standpoint. (I&rsquo;m using the lowest-level Linode offering, which provides 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM.) However, the disk space usage is growing. The database itself isn&rsquo;t overly large, but the cache directory (which stores profile pictures, preview cards for images) is up over 15 GB. I could work to get really aggressive about cache management, but realistically a larger cache is a reasonable thing. Mastodon provisions for this by providing easy hooks to use S3 buckets for the cache, so I figured I&rsquo;d give that a shot.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/cybrespace/cybrespace-meta/blob/master/s3.md">Nolan Lawson&rsquo;s excellent step-by-step instructions</a> and followed them to a T. Well, almost to a T. I first went to set up an S3 bucket, kicked off the script to copy the cache over from Linode to S3, then went to bed. The next morning I did some more reading and decided that Linode&rsquo;s very similar Object Storage service (it&rsquo;s just their S3 clone) might be a better deal cost-wise. Amazon S3 charges a small amount per GB for storage and then a different rate for data access. Linode does it slightly differently - you pay a flat fee per month for a given bucket size, and then you get a large amount of transfer every month for free. Since my server is already on Linode, it was easier and simpler to just use the Linode buckets, so I tried again there.</p>
<p>One gotcha that&rsquo;s not obvious when creating the bucket at Linode: if you&rsquo;re going to put a custom domain name in front of the bucket, you need to name the bucket that domain name if you want their TLS/SSL stuff to work. In my case, I setup a CNAME record to point <em>assets.iowadon.org</em> at my bucket, so I needed to name my bucket <em>assets.iowadon.org</em>. There&rsquo;s no renaming buckets, so I had to empty and delete my old one and then create a new one with the correct name. After that the certificate generation went smoothly enough and I once again kicked off the copy job. Then I went to the gym.</p>
<p>A couple hours and 68,000 file copies later, my cache is in the bucket and a quick restart of Mastodon via docker-compose pulled in the configuration updates that now point out to the cloud. It went amazingly smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="_edit-i-posted-this-a-little-too-soon_"><em>Edit: I posted this a little too soon&hellip;</em></h2>
<p>All the existing assets were working fine, but new assets weren&rsquo;t loading properly. Commence some more googling. The correct answer was that in addition to the <code>.env.production</code> settings listed in the instructions above, you also need this one:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>S3_ENDPOINT=https://&lt;linode_region&gt;.linodeobjects.com
</code></pre><p>In my instance, that looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>S3_ENDPOINT=https://us-southeast-1.linodeobjects.com/
</code></pre><p><em>Now</em> it seems to be fully working.</p>

			 <p>I was familiar with Carter Burwell&rsquo;s name thanks to his score for the Coen brothers' film <em>True Grit</em>, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware of the full scope of his film compositions or of his backstory. A brilliant man who just picked up and learned lots of things. Just out of college and trying to make it as a musician while working a lousy warehouse job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, Burwell saw a help-wanted ad in the <em>Times</em> for a computer programmer at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a nonprofit research institution whose director, James D. Watson, had shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 for discovering the structure of DNA. Burwell wrote a jokey letter in which he said that, although he had none of the required skills, he would cost less to employ than someone with a Ph.D. would. Surprisingly, the letter got him the job, and he spent two years as the chief computer scientist on a protein-cataloguing project funded by a grant from the Muscular Dystrophy Association. “Watson let me live at the lab, and he would invite me to his house for breakfast with all these amazing people,” he said. When that job ended, Burwell worked on 3-D modelling and digital audio in the New York Institute of Technology’s Computer Graphics Lab, several of whose principal researchers had just left to start Pixar.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With the Muskian shenanigans happening over at Twitter, I’ve been looking into Mastodon as an alternative social media site. It’s an interesting concept - a distributed network of servers that all talk to each other through an open protocol. So, being the nerdy sort, I decided to try setting up my own server. Here’s how it went:</p>
<h2 id="registering-a-domain-name">Registering a Domain Name</h2>
<p>Just deciding on the domain name was the hardest part, I think. But once I settled on iowadon.org, I went over to <a href="HTTPS://hover.com">Hover</a> and registered it. Easy peasy.</p>
<h2 id="smtp-email-service">SMTP email service</h2>
<p>Mastodon needs an SMTP mail service to send notification emails. Not wanting to tie it to my personal Fastmail account, I looked around and determined that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon AWS Simple Email Service (SES)</a> was a reasonable fit. The pricing is scalable and pretty cheap ($1 / 1000 emails at this time). It took a little bit of time to get configured, but the AWS website walked me through the steps pretty clearly. Basically, AWS will give you three pieces of info: an SMTP server name (available on the SMTP settings page, will be something like <code>email-smtp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>) and then a username and password. For the latter two it generates a pair that look like guacamole, and it warns you it will only ever show you them once, so copy and paste them to a useful location. If you lose them you&rsquo;ll have to regenerate a new pair.</p>
<p>Also note: if you’re a new AWS account, AWS will put you in a restricted mode until you request a review and a move into production. Once you verify a domain identity you can also verify individual emails. You need to do this before you setup Mastodon because Mastodon will want to send you an email or two.)</p>
<h2 id="linode">Linode</h2>
<p>I decided I didn’t want to go with a hosted setup - most of the custom hosting providers are all slammed right now, too - so it felt like my best options were either <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> or <a href="https://linode.com">Linode</a>. DigitalOcean advertises a <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/mastodon">pre-configured “droplet”</a> that will give you a Mastodon instance with a minimum of configuration; Linode provides <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/install-mastodon-on-ubuntu-2004/">instructions for installing Mastodon on Ubuntu 20.04</a>. I went with Linode.</p>
<p>I started out with a 1 CPU core, 2 GB of RAM, 50 GB disk space Linode. Once I get past the initial credit they give you (go find a referral link&hellip; my account is still too new to be able to give you one of my own), I think they&rsquo;ll charge me $10/mo for it. We&rsquo;ll see how well it performs if I get more than a few users.</p>
<p>The instructions were good as far as they went, but a few key things seemed to be missing. I&rsquo;m going to walk through the instruction sections here and comment on them.</p>
<h3 id="before-you-begin">&ldquo;Before You Begin&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This section was pretty straightforward. I followed the instructions for Creating a Compute Instance, Setting up and Securing a Compute Instance, and Adding DNS Records.</p>
<h3 id="install-docker-and-docker-compose">&ldquo;Install Docker and Docker Compose&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Followed the instructions for installing Docker, then for installing Docker Compose. When you clone the Mastodon git repository in the next step, it includes a docker-compose file. It took me a few minutes to realize that the docker-compose also includes the Postgres database, so there&rsquo;s no separate database installation required on the Linode server.</p>
<h3 id="download-mastodon">&ldquo;Download Mastodon&rdquo;</h3>
<p>OK, this bit was simple. It&rsquo;s just a git clone command.</p>
<h3 id="configure-docker-compose">&ldquo;Configure Docker Compose&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Editing the docker-compose file is a little bit of a pain. Pay attention to the details. For step #3, setting up the Postgres password, db, and user, you can set the password to whatever you want it to be. Write it down because you will need it down in the next section.</p>
<p>Now, step 6, generating SECRET_KEY_BASE and OTP_SECRET. There are 4 separate commands in the instruction box: 2 echos to create the values and two &lsquo;sed&rsquo; lines that I mistakenly assumed would write the value into the config file. Don&rsquo;t assume that! Follow the instructions directly and copy/paste the values for SECRET_KEY_BASE and OTP_SECRET into the .env.production file. Same story with the VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY and VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY.</p>
<h3 id="complete-the-docker-compose-setup">&ldquo;Complete the Docker Compose Setup&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The involved command here is the <em>rake</em> command that does the initial database setup. It will ask you a bunch of questions here, many of them duplicate info to what you just put into .env.production. Such is life.</p>
<h3 id="initiate-the-docker-compose-services">&ldquo;Initiate the Docker Compose Services&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Two commands. Easy peasy.</p>
<h3 id="setup-an-httphttps-proxy">&ldquo;Setup an HTTP/HTTPS Proxy&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Here we install nginx. There&rsquo;s an nginx.conf file in the Mastodon distro that is a good start, but <strong>there are changes you will need to make to it</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two lines that say <code>root /home/mastodon/live/public;</code>. You have to change these lines. Having followed the instructions thus far, the actual location of my /public folder was <code>/home/chris/mastodon/public</code>. Update the root lines to point to the actual location of your public folder.</p>
<p>Next edit, and I don&rsquo;t remember where I found it, but it seems to work: every instance in that file that says <code>try_files $uri =404;</code> needs to be updated to say <code>try_files $uri @proxy;</code></p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all I had to do to the nginx config.</p>
<h3 id="get-an-ssltls-certificate">&ldquo;Get an SSL/TLS Certificate&rdquo;</h3>
<p>I followed the steps to install Certbot, but when I got to step #4 where you run certbot to generate a certificate, I got an error saying that there was no ssl in a listen section of my nginx configuration. It turns out there is a &ldquo;snake oil&rdquo; certificate you set up first to get things moving, then you can get and install the real certificate. For the snake oil thing, use the steps described <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/error-while-running-nginx-c-etc-nginx-nginx-conf-t/170408/6">here</a>. I then had to cleanup a broken renewal with steps listed <a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/certstorageerror-renewal-config-file-is-missing-a-required-file-reference/94243">here</a>, but that may have been because I was messing around w/ certificate stuff before I found out about the snake oil. If your renewal dry run works ok, you can ignore that second link.</p>
<h3 id="using-mastodon">&ldquo;Using Mastodon&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The instructions would lead you to believe at this point that the site is ready to use. However, when I went to iowadon.org, I just got an nginx configuration error. After a bunch of debugging, the key issue I found was this: I had never run any command that did a bundle install, that step where ruby installs and builds all the gems listed in Mastodon&rsquo;s gem file. Of course it&rsquo;s not gonna work that way!</p>
<p>The command you will want to run is <code>bundle exec rails assets:precompile</code>.</p>
<p>When I ran that it then sent me through several searches to install other libraries on the linux server. To save yourself some time, run this:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt install ruby-bundler ruby-dev ruby-full build-essential libicu-dev zlib1g-dev openssl libgmp-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev libpq-dev</code></p>
<p>That should give you all the libraries you need to complete the bundle install.</p>
<h3 id="it-works">It works!</h3>
<p>After all that, sure enough, it worked! My Linode CPU usage had been sitting solidly between 10% and 15% the whole time, apparently because it was in a loop continuously trying to restart my misconfigured Rails app. Once Rails started up cleanly, the CPU usage went down to about 2%.</p>
<h3 id="adding-another-admin-user">Adding another admin user</h3>
<p>I originally set up an admin account for <a href="https://iowadon.org">iowadon.org</a> during the setup steps. Then I realized I would want my own account (<a href="https://iowadon.org/web/@cjhubbs">@cjhubbs@iowadon.org</a>) to be an admin once I moved it over. How to do that, I wondered? Turns out Mastodon has a command-line tool called tootctl just for this purpose. But to run tootctl and get it to talk to the database running in Docker, you need to run a special version of the command. What you&rsquo;re looking for is this:</p>
<p><code>docker-compose run --rm web bin/tootctl &lt;tootctl command&gt;</code></p>
<p>Magic!</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>First off: it&rsquo;s amazing how much snappier Mastodon is on this server than back on mastodon.social. The account migration process went smoothly enough, too. I will advertise it to a few friends once I get the Amazon AWS SES account moved to production so it can send emails to people other than me. Then we&rsquo;ll see if it gets any traction. I&rsquo;ll follow up later.</p>

			 <p>On my work trip to Brussels last week I was introduced to the <a href="https://tastecooking.com/waffle-town/">liège waffle</a>, a type of waffle that is denser and sweeter than the common “Belgian waffle” that I’m used to in the States. They were delicious! So when I got home there was no possible option but to find a recipe and try making them myself.</p>
<p>When you go search through the multitude of online recipies for liège waffles, you find that the secret ingredient for these things is <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-pearl-sugar-5202956">pearl sugar</a> — a compressed form of sugar bits smaller than sugar cubes, roughly the size of mini M&amp;Ms. So, I ordered some from Amazon, printed off <a href="https://bakerbettie.com/real-belgian-liege-waffles/">this recipe</a>, and got to work.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With liège waffles you don’t really have a waffle <em>batter</em> - it’s more a waffle <em>dough.</em> It’s sort of a brioche, more similar to cinnamon roll dough that I’ve made than to pancake batter. Threw it all in to the KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook and kneaded it for 5 minutes, then threw it into a warm oven to let it rise for an hour.</p>
<p>Once the dough has risen you knead in the pearl sugar, which gives you a strange mound of dough that crunches when you cut it up into pieces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Throw these guys into the waffle maker and they cook up very nicely! I used a medium heat that turned out to be just right to caramelize the sugar, giving the waffles a nice shine and a nice crisp surface.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The caramelization is, of course, a little more work to clean up…</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Might scale the pearl sugar back by about 20% next time but otherwise this recipe was great! Not quite to the level I got from the pros in Belgium but for sure a good Saturday morning breakfast. These were a hit with the family and we will definitely be making them again.</p>

			 <p>Rich Mullins died on Sept 19, 1997 in a car accident. A songwriter, poet, and prophet, Rich spoke with a voice that had grabbed my heart as a teenager. Hearing that he had died then ripped my heart right out.</p>
<p>I still remember sitting in church on Sunday morning probably 36 hours later and hearing Pastor Jim (himself a great musician) mention Rich&rsquo;s death from up front. I was stunned. Leaning forward, I put my face in my hands and tried to grapple with this news while my fiancée put a comforting hand on my back, unsure what to do next.</p>
<p>At some point later that fall I assembled a group of musician friends and put together three of Rich&rsquo;s songs and got permission to play them in his memory at a college chapel service. I&rsquo;m sure we didn&rsquo;t really do justice to &ldquo;Awesome God&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hold Me, Jesus&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; that day, but it felt like the least I could do to honor someone whose music had meant so much to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written about Rich&rsquo;s music many times here on the blog. <a href="/17/09/andrew-peterson-and-friends-the-ragamuffin-album-live-at-the-ryman/">The concert summary of the tribute concert at the Ryman</a>, the post where I realized that <a href="/14/04/which-artist-had-the-impact/">Rich wasn&rsquo;t the one playing the piano on all those recordings</a>, and <a href="/12/09/in-an-alternate-universe/">the wistful alternate-universe press release</a> (10 years old already!?!) are perhaps worth revisiting.</p>
<p>Today, though, on the 25th anniversary of his passing, this short clip (shared by Shane Claiborne on Twitter) reminds us Rich&rsquo;s message remains relevant today.</p>

<p>Rest in Peace, brother, awaiting the resurrection.</p>

<p>I have on occasion paraphrased something Fr. Robert Capon wrote about God’s love as ”if God is a bastard, we’re all in trouble”. I went digging for the original quote today and came up short of any such choice phrase, but for reference, here’s the longer quote from <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3yqDir5">Between Noon and Three</a></em> which makes that point, if just a bit less colorfully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…I have, in this parable, been working only one side of the street — in my effort to do justice to grace, I have neglected justice itself. I am fully aware that in doing so, I have laid myself open to the charge of granting not only screwing licenses but also franchises for far worse things: for pride and prejudice, for torture and exploitation — in short, for getting away with murder.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In my defense, let me point out that Scripture lays itself open to the same charge — and that the other side of the street has been worked so long, so hard, and so often that most people don’t even know there is a sunny side…
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But there’s more to it than that. I have expounded Saint Paul to you as saying that not only are <em>we</em> dead to sin but that God is dead to it too — that he has put himself out of commission on the whole subject of blame. And so, indeed, he has: ”I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
I am fully aware that the Scriptures are paradoxical — that God speaks with a forked tongue — and that every lovely thing he says on the side of leniency can be matched by a dozen stringencies that will curl your hair. But I am also convinced that each of us has to make a decision about such utterances. When someone tells you many different things about his attitude toward you, you must first look at him long and long, and decide for yourself whether you care about him at all. But if you finally come to the conclusion that you do care, you must then decide which of his words you will take as his <em>governing</em> word. You ask me why I think God’s leniency governs his severity? Why grace is his sovereign attribute? Well, all I can say to you is that having been a father who has spoken out of both sides of his mouth to six children for twenty-six years — and having all those years believed in a heavenly Father who saves us not by sitting in his penthouse issuing edicts but by sending us the warm, furry body of a Son who drank the nights away with us and died obscurely of the foolishness of it all — all I can say is that I put my bet on the left fork of the tongue. It is my best hope that when my children think of everything I have said and done to them, they choose to remember the times of my severity when I just gave them a kiss on the cheek, poured myself a Scotch, and shut up. And it is my last hope that God hopes the same for himself.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So I really do make no apology for landing on the sunny side of the street. I am sorry if I have offended you; but to me there are some things that simply override everything that comes before or after. And I am sorrier still if you do not feel the same way. For without that ultimate cassation — without that final quashing of the subpoena, that throwing of the prosecution’s case out of court which is the only music there is for the ears of the hopelessly guilty — you and I, Virginia, are simply sunk.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>June 2022 was quite a month for me. It started with the death of a long-time friend. It ended with my being on a phone call with my father while he experienced a stroke-like event. (Turns out: not a stroke. He&rsquo;s home, and doing ok. Hallelujah.) In the middle was a thing called Pride Month, which had a little more visibility at our home than usual. Two of my kids identify as LGBTQIA+ and have embraced visibility more this year than ever before. (I got their permission to say this here.) So, one of these things is not like the other, but stick with me here and I’ll connect the dots.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-online-community">Part 1: Online Community</h3>
<p>Since <a href="/22/06/geof-f-morris-1978-2022/">Geof died last month</a>, the online community he fostered for nearly 20 years (referred to as &ldquo;RMFO&rdquo; for reasons long since forgotten) has been renewed. I have hosted two Zoom &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo; calls, and both times 15-20 people have joined, chatted for 2-3 hours, and left with a request that we schedule another one. We have spent these hours catching up on life and recounting our own personal histories as they interact with the RMFO community: singles who met their future spouses in the group; couples once struggling to conceive who now have teenagers; marriages, divorces, job changes, moves, faith evolutions. Online friendships have led to &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; friendships, meet-ups, and job opportunities. At the end of the first call I realized that, while I had long considered many of these people meaningful to me, the call helped me realize that <em>I</em> was meaningful to <em>them</em>, too. My thought last week as I closed out the second call: <em>this is the closest thing I&rsquo;ve had to a healthy, functioning community in my adult life</em>.</p>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s call I talked about how my own personal views on some issues have evolved over the years, and how I have struggled to find an in-person community (specifically, a church community) where that evolution was welcome. Share those views too loudly and you will be welcome to find some <em>other</em> church to serve and worship at. Five years of quiet discomfort weren&rsquo;t enough to dislodge me from my last church; their tepid COVID response was the straw that gave me the courage to break the proverbial camel&rsquo;s back. Two years later I still haven&rsquo;t found a new place to join. If I&rsquo;m honest, I haven&rsquo;t really looked too hard.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-my-dad">Part 2: My Dad</h3>
<p>My dad is talking a little slower thanks to the medications he&rsquo;s on after his health scare, but he&rsquo;s not talking any <em>less</em>. When we talked last week after he got home from the hospital, we spent a while comparing current reading lists and discussing how some of the books I have given him over the years have helped guide his journey out of a fundamentalist faith into something much more open and gracious. That&rsquo;s his story to tell, not mine. But what he said toward the end of the call stuck with me: that coming close to death now makes him unwilling to stay quiet on the topics important to him. And I thought to myself: that&rsquo;s a lesson I should take to heart here in my 40s.</p>
<h3 id="part-3-chuck-pearson">Part 3: Chuck Pearson</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShorterPearson">Chuck Pearson</a> is a friend of one of the RMFO guys — someone I have never met but have followed on Twitter for years. Last week he posted <a href="https://chuckpearson.wordpress.com/2022/06/30/a-postcard-from-the-journey/">a beautiful essay about his journey</a> leaving a tenured professorship at a Southern Baptist university when he knew he would eventually be required to sign a &ldquo;personal lifestyle statement&rdquo; that would &ldquo;[force] him to disown his LGBTQ+ friends and family&rdquo;. Chuck ultimately found a post at another university, but still sat quiet about the topic of LGBTQ+ inclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it stayed private because I didn’t want to burn those bridges. Even as I made that realization that I had to choose between two sides I cared about deeply, I couldn’t bring myself to take that final step of declaring my choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his essay, Chuck quotes from <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/a-word-to-those-on-the-journey/">an Alan Jacobs essay from 2014</a> that argues for Christians to stand firm against the cultural evolution of views on sexuality. Here is Jacobs' conclusion [preserving the emphasis from the original post]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either throughout your history or at some significant point in your history you let your views on a massively important issue be shaped largely by what was acceptable in the cultural circles within which you hoped to be welcome. <strong>How do you plan to keep that from happening again?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly Jacobs has in mind a call to resist the desire to be welcomed by &ldquo;the world&rdquo; by accepting &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; views on sexuality. But for me his question takes the exact opposite orientation. How long have I been convinced about full acceptance of LGBTQIA+ people in the church but been afraid to say so, knowing that it would make me unwelcome in the evangelical church circles I have run in my entire life? <strong>Far too long.</strong></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>So let me make a long-overdue statement as clearly as I can. <strong>I am a Christian, and I affirm those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual as they are, unconditionally, including their full inclusion into the assembled body of Christ known as the local church.</strong> I know there are those who would say I cannot hold that view and be a Christian. I reject that assertion.</p>
<p>There are multiple serious approaches to the Scripture on the topic which I will not go into here. Suffice it for now to say that you cannot read Scripture as a flat text. It is the product of thousands of years of God’s progressive revelation as understood and recorded by humans. In the end you have to come to some conclusion on which texts capture most clearly the essence of who God is, and use those as the framework from which to understand the rest.</p>
<p>And so, to quote <a href="https://brianzahnd.com/2011/08/god-is-like-jesus-2/">Brian Zahnd</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God is like Jesus.<br>
God has always been like Jesus.<br>
There has never been a time when God was not like Jesus.<br>
We have not always known what God is like—<br>
But now we do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus taught these two principles in summation of all the teaching: love God with everything you have, and love your neighbor as yourself. He embraced the outsiders and rebuked the self-righteous. He called us to follow Him in lives of self-sacrificial love.</p>
<p>In addition to Jesus’ teaching, we have the witness of the Holy Spirit in the lives of our LGBTQIA+ brothers and sisters — so many dear, tender souls who consistently model what it means to follow Jesus, even in the midst of a church that rarely welcomes them. And to that I can only respond as the Apostle Peter did after first seeing the conversion of Gentiles to Christ: &ldquo;Can anyone object to their being baptized, now that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?&rdquo; (Acts 10:47)</p>
<p>Rachel Held Evans summarized it this way: &ldquo;The apostles remembered what many modern Christians tend to forget—that what makes the gospel offensive isn’t who it keeps out but who it lets in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this I say: Amen. May it be so.</p>

			 <p>It had been a long time since I’d listened to this song. Then it came across my playlist this morning. Don Chaffer of Waterdeep in some strange alter ego called <a href="https://www.waterdeep.com/the-khrusty-brothers-lyrics">The Khrusty Brothers</a>, with his own perspective on being angry at God…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I came stumbling into church with a hot gun in my hands<br>
I was ready to talk to Jesus to tell him my demands<br>
But Jesus ain&rsquo;t no fool He&rsquo;s seen this kinda thing before<br>
And He had a couple angels stop me at the front door<br>
I said “now come on that ain&rsquo;t fair You should be accessible to all”<br>
He said “everybody gets a secretary even just to take their calls”<br>
“So address me to my face If you think you&rsquo;ve got the balls<br>
But I ain&rsquo;t playin' around  boy, at all”
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
This was not what I expected, so I stiffened in my stance<br>
And I tried hard to remember every single shitty circumstance<br>
Then I quivered like a victim with his predator in sight<br>
I was ready now to vindicate, I was ready to start a fight<br>
Now you can stand right there and judge me<br>
Shoot, you can send me straight to hell<br>
I know you got the power I know that fact full well<br>
But before you do explain to me<br>
Why suffering and why death?<br>
And why did I pray all those years<br>
And waste all that good breath?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
Well the angels sang it under their breath by the door<br>
Hallelujah, Hallelujah<br>
I give up, I can&rsquo;t go on like this any more
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
“Well I appreciate your kind”, he said and then Jesus poured a drink<br>
My face musta looked funny cause he said, “It&rsquo;s not like you think”<br>
“I&rsquo;m saddled with the job you know of interpreting my Dad<br>
To a bunch of frightened people, frightened or just mad<br>
And most of &lsquo;em think they got it right” (and then he threw some ice cubes in)<br>
“But most of &lsquo;em are just dead wrong about life and death and sin<br>
And then I got my fiancée, she&rsquo;s supposed to speak my mind<br>
But sometimes she&rsquo;s just chicken and then she messes it up other times…”

			 <p><em>Mild spoilers ensue.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is basically the most 1980’s war film you could make in the 2020s. All the sunsets and American flags.</li>
<li>Owes plenty to <em>Star Wars</em>. Flying the trench to hit a 3-meter target without the use of your targeting system? Enemy fighters wearing faceless black helmets as they piloted their superior craft? Mobbed by jubilant crew members as you exit the fighter after returning victorious? The only thing missing was a princess to hand out medals afterward.</li>
<li>There was a little Tom Cruise greeting to moviegoers that played before the movie. Cruise looked <em>much</em> older in that greeting than he did in the film. He’s aging sort of Robert Redford style.</li>
<li>Movie relies heavily on slow, lingering golden hour shots of Tom Cruise and/or Jennifer Connelly in a medium shot. I mean, they’re both pretty people, so it’s not all bad.</li>
<li>Pretty sure if you took all those lingering shots out the movie length would cut down from 2:10 to something like 1:30. OK, maybe 1:45.</li>
<li>In the initial shot where Cruise is shown a roster of pilots he will train, Manny Jacinto’s (Jason Mendoza from <em>The Good Place</em>) face is in the top-left corner. Jacinto is nowhere to be found in the rest of the movie, though. Poor guy got left on the editing floor I guess.</li>
<li>I hadn’t realized that Val Kilmer was so ill. His whole plot line was weak - he is introduced as COMPACFLT who brings Maverick in, then his cancer is back but “nobody knows”, even though he’s an invalid and can’t speak, and then he dies and is buried within the next week? Plenty of the movie beggars belief, but that thread was the worst.</li>
<li>On the whole it was lightweight fun - worth watching on the big screen, not worth watching a second time.</li>

<p>Geoffrey Franklin Morris, 43, of Madison, Alabama, died today at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville. He is survived by his wife Danielle, his parents, his brother Doug, his dog Lucky, and hundreds of friends around the world.</p>
<p>Geof was born in Knoxville, TN in 1978. The younger son in a military family, Geof spent time in San Antonio, Texas and Beavercreek, Ohio before eventually settling in Forest, Mississippi in 1990 after his father retired from the Air Force. He attended high school at The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, where his love for engineering and science led him not only to pursue a career focused on outer space, but also led him into the early days of social communities on the internet. Geof attended the University of Alabama Huntsville and graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering and an undying love for UAH Chargers ice hockey.</p>
<p>Geof’s career started at Teledyne Brown Engineering (TBE) where he designed equipment and managed projects building science equipment destined for the International Space Station. After a brief hiatus from the aerospace world to work for Wordpress, Geof got a job at NASA where he eventually became a flight controller for the ISS. One of Geof’s great joys in life was being on comms with astronauts and walking them through daily procedures.</p>
<p>Geof had an amazing passion for online community. In high school he frequented online bulletin board discussions. He was fond of reminding friends that he had interacted directly with Tom Clancy in bulletin board discussions about Clancy’s novels. Later on, Geof’s love of the band Caedmon’s Call and their tight-knit fan community would prompt him to create and administer an online forum for them. “Rocksmyfaceoff.net” (RMFO to its regulars) was an active community for more than a decade in the early 2000s, and continues to this day in nooks and crannies of the social internet. Geof embraced Twitter when it was a new service and had posted over 100,000 tweets before many others were even aware of what Twitter was. He was a prolific blogger who was always looking to support the online communities he benefitted from. <a href="HTTPS://gfmorris.net">His website</a> is full of thoughts on social sharing, technical advice, and concert bootleg recordings.</p>
<p>Geof was just as generous and gregarious in person as he was online. Whether you had known him for years or were just meeting him for the first time, he would put you at ease with his friendly conversation. He seemingly knew everyone, and would quickly introduce and connect you to others who he thought you should know. His meticulously-managed contact list included award-winning musicians, astronauts, internet tech royalty, an NHL goalie, and a whole bunch of normal mundane people. No matter who you were he would pay attention to personal details and important dates; mention your anniversary on Twitter one year and the next year he would wish you a happy anniversary, having captured that info about you the year before.</p>
<p>Along with wanting to work on space projects, Geof not so quietly wanted to fall in love with a pretty girl and get married. If she were a redhead, that would be a bonus. That wish came true for him in 2014 when he met a young red-headed NASA engineer named Danielle. Geof and Danielle married in 2015 and lived happily at their home near Huntsville until his passing.</p>
<p>Geof loved UAH hockey, the Boston Celtics and Bruins, Wilco, Radiohead, Caedmon’s Call, and <em>The Big Lebowski</em>. But mostly Geof loved people. Whether you were an astronaut or a random college kid, Geof treated you with respect and as an equal. He is mourned today by hundreds of friends and communities that are the product of his life-long labors of love.</p>

			 <p>For a guy who loves music, I’ve never been the guy who finds and falls in love with an artist on their first album. From my youth I have tended to find bands on their second or third album - probably the popular one - then gone back and learned their back catalog.</p>
<p>In high school, this meant getting to know Michael W. Smith through <em>Go West Young Man</em> and then backing up to appreciate <em>i2EYE</em>; falling in love with Rich Mullins’ <em>Liturgy, Legacy</em> record and then going back to <em>Never Picture Perfect</em>, and bypassing my brother’s recommendation of Caedmon’s Call until their producer insisted on some highly uncharacteristic horns on the title track of <em>Long Line of Leavers</em> that sucked me in. (<em>Self Titled</em> or <em>40 Acres</em>? I still can’t decide which is their best record.)</p>
<p>As an adult I wasn’t into Coldplay until <em>X&amp;Y</em> and then belatedly recognized the brilliance of <em>Parachutes</em> and <em>Rush of Blood to the Head</em>. I met U2 via <em>All That You Can’t Leave Behind</em> and still probably don’t sufficiently appreciate <em>Achtung Baby</em> and <em>The Joshua Tree</em>. And then there’s Arcade Fire.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m sure I’d heard of Arcade Fire from friends at some point early on. <em>Neon Bible</em> had a lot of buzz in my Twitter follows. Somehow it just never caught my ear. But then <em>The Suburbs</em> came out in late 2010, somewhere in the winter I picked it up on an AmazonMP3 $3.99 sale (remember those days?), and in spring 2011 when I trained for a half-marathon, it was my running music. (Somehow my initial download from Amazon missed the first two tracks, so for a long time I thought the album started with “Modern Man”. Not sure when I realized I was missing songs.)</p>
<p>The albums we really fall in love with are the ones we identify with somehow. When Rich Mullins sang “my folks we were always / the first family to arrive / with seven people jammed into / a car that seated five”, my heart ached in recognition of our own 7-member family adventures in undersized, well used cars. When Andrew Osenga sang “my tiny baby’s breathing / deeper every day / soon she’ll leave her crib forever”, I resonated with the heart of a kindred new father. And when Win Butler lamented “oh, this city’s seen so much / since I was a little child / Pray to God I won’t live to see / the death of everything that’s wild”, mid-30s suburban dad me felt it in my core. <em>The Suburbs</em> burrowed its way into my heart like few albums ever have.</p>
<p>Arcade Fire’s fire burns hot. Band leader Win Butler grew up in Houston. His wife, Régine Chassagne, is from Montreal but has roots in Haiti. He grew up Mormon and majored in religious studies at McGill. They aren’t a “Christian band” and say they don’t really practice religion, but their songs give voice to the Gen X disillusionment with and deconstruction of establishment Christianity that many of us have experienced. In “Here Comes the Night Time”, using the voice of Haitians to reject the legalistic strictures of white Christianity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say heaven&rsquo;s a place<br>
Yeah, heaven&rsquo;s a place, and they know where it is<br>
But you know where it is?<br>
It&rsquo;s behind the gate, they won&rsquo;t let you in
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
And when they hear the beat coming from the street<br>
They lock the door<br>
But if there&rsquo;s no music up in heaven,<br>
Then what&rsquo;s it for?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When I hear the beat<br>
My spirit&rsquo;s on me like a live-wire<br>
A thousand horses running wild<br>
In a city on fire
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But it starts in your feet, then it goes to your head<br>
And, if you can&rsquo;t feel it, then the roots are dead<br>
And if you&rsquo;re the judge, then what is our crime?<br>
Here comes the night time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in “City With No Children” where the young rebel starts to wonder if he is slowly becoming the establishment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You never trust a millionaire<br>
Quoting the sermon on the mount<br>
I used to think I was not like them<br>
But I&rsquo;m beginning to have my doubts<br>
My doubts about it
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When you&rsquo;re hiding underground<br>
The rain can&rsquo;t get you wet<br>
Do you think your righteousness<br>
Can pay the interest on your debt?<br>
I have my doubts about it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rock is strong, the band is large, the music sometimes cacophonous, always intense, always pulsating with a righteous intensity.</p>

<p><em>The Suburbs</em> was nominated for Best Album of the Year at the 2011 Grammy Awards. I remember the currents in my Twitter stream from those of us who knew and loved the band. They were up against Eminem, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Lady Antebellum… there was no way they could win. Was there?</p>
<p>Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson announced the award and clearly had no idea, reading the award card, whether <em>The Suburbs</em> was the name of the band or the album. But there it was, Album of the Year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5npCMAok-M">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>The band had been backstage, getting ready to play a song to close the show. They came out, accepted their Grammy, then Win set it down on his amp <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rqvlMuoGRc">and away they went</a> with “Ready to Start”. Always live, always real, always ready to play.</p>
<p>In 2014 they went on tour with their new album <em>Reflektor</em>. The novelty for that tour was asking fans to dress up (think evening wear) to attend the show. One week in the fall of 2013, before the album released, I was on a work trip in Montreal and they announced a show at a small club nearby the hotel I was staying at. With only a $10 entry fee. I chose that night to go eat dinner with my co-workers rather than stand in line for a chance to get into the show. I’ve never forgiven myself for that decision. I finally saw them on that tour later in the year at the Target Center in Minneapolis. It was the first and likely last time I’ll ever wear a necktie to a rock concert.</p>

<p>Last week Arcade Fire released <em>WE</em>, their first new record in five years, and their first good one in nine years. (Can we just pretend <em>Everything Now</em> didn’t happen?) Where <em>The Suburbs</em> captured the frustration of 30-somethings realizing the unescapable strictures of the modern world, <em>WE</em> expresses the resistant hope of 40-somethings coming through the COVID era. <em>The Suburbs</em> Arcade Fire were parents of small children; the <em>WE</em> Arcade Fire now see their kids growing up and leaving.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lookout kid, trust your heart<br>
You don&rsquo;t have to play the part they wrote for you<br>
Just be true<br>
There are things that you could do<br>
That no one else on earth could ever do<br>
But I can&rsquo;t teach you, I can&rsquo;t teach it to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In “The Lightning I”, the strain of the past decade weighs heavily:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can make it if you don&rsquo;t quit on me<br>
I won&rsquo;t quit on you<br>
Don’t quit on me<br>
We can make it, baby<br>
Please don&rsquo;t quit on me<br>
I won&rsquo;t quit on you<br>
Don&rsquo;t quit on me<br>
I never quit on you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seamlessly transitions into “The Lightning II”, which brings a weary hope to the middle of tired frustration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer<br>
But I find I got the question wrong<br>
I was trying to run away, but a voice told me to stay<br>
And put the feeling in a song</p>
<p>A day, a week, a month, a year<br>
A day, a week, a month, a year<br>
Every second brings me here</p>
<p>Waiting on the lightning<br>
Waiting on the lightning<br>
Waiting on the light<br>
What will the light bring?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again my heart resonates with an artist. . Waiting on the lightning, yes. Hopeful that it will come. And yet shaken enough from the past 5 years of madness to have to ask the question - what will the light bring?</p>

<p>So much to love about this. I wanted to find a recording that wasn’t the canonical Bolling/Rampal version… this one is pretty great. I love the way the flautist starts the theme and the trio looks at each other as if to say ”wow, this tempo is hot”. (I checked and they are playing it right at the tempo of the canonical recording.)</p>
<p>Such a joyful piece, and by the time they get to the final restatement of the theme as a swinging four-piece band (say, about 3:20 in the video), how can you not have a smile on your face?</p>
<p>In my best world I would have a flautist, drummer, and bassist I could play this with. So much fun. Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>Christ is risen! Alleluia!</p>
<p>This morning Becky and I attended church in person for the first time since COVID struck. It’s been more than two years. It was our first time at this church—we left our last one during the pandemic. Even having watched services from this new place many times online, it felt odd to attend in person.</p>
<p>The oddest thing for me, though, was that I was only <em>attending</em>, not leading in some way. Absent from Easter for the first time in my adult life was any music rehearsal. I didn’t show up 90 minutes early. I didn’t play music for 3 services. I came, worshipped, shook the pastor’s hand on the way out, and was back home before 9:30.</p>
<p>Reporting my attendance back to friends on Twitter, I asked rhetorically: <em>is it even Easter if I haven’t rehearsed and played music at 3 services</em>?</p>
<p>That question led to a more sober line of questioning. How much of my understanding of service and worship has been formed, or malformed, by a lifetime of working somehow at church every time the door was open?</p>
<p>Every pastor will affirm that ministry is work. I can’t help but think, though, that something is broken when I leave church thinking <em>was it even really worship if I’m not exhausted on the way out?</em></p>
<p>Two years of church non-attendance have led me to reconsider what faithfulness in the way of Jesus looks like in daily life. Restarting attendance now prompts a new exploration: what it looks like to meaningfully participate in a church without it regularly leading to exhaustion.</p>
<p><em>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</em> — Jesus</p>

			 <p>Last night I started reading Dr. Susannah Heschel’s <em>The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany</em>. Having not gotten any further than the introduction there are eerie parallels between the support the German church gave to Nazism and the support the American evangelical church is giving to the MAGA movement. A few samples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The German Christian movement was faction within the Protestant church of Germany, not a separate sect, and eventually attracted between a quarter and a third of Protestant church members. Enthusiastically pro-Nazi, the movement sought to demonstrate its support for Hitler by organizing itself after the model of the Nazi Party, placing a swastika on the altar next to the cross, giving the Nazi salute at its rallies, and celebrating Hitler as sent by God.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>The three ideological prongs of the German Christian movement within the Protestant church, as Doris Bergen has delineated, were its opposition to church doctrine, its antisemitism, <strong>and its effort to craft a “manly” church…</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>German Christians appropriated Nazi rhetoric and symbols into the church to give its Christianity a contemporary resonance.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>Theological conclusions regarding Jesus’s teachings and his interactions with the Jews of his day were shaped into a rhetoric that endorsed Nazi ideology, making Nazism appear to be realizing in the political sphere what Christians taught in the religious sphere.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With 2022 well underway (for the past 10 hours or so) it’s time to review my reading in 2021. As usual, my entire reading log for last year is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;shelf=2021-reads">over on Goodreads</a>. This year my reading was influenced by a reading group I joined that focused on books by black, indigenous, and queer authors. (It was a fantastic group, and I’m sad to see it end.)</p>
<h4 id="running-the-numbers">Running the numbers</h4>
<p>I finished 79 books this year, which is in my usual neighborhood. Of those, 34/78 were written by women, but only 17/78 were written by non-white people. As a friend put it when posting his reading lists yesterday, let’s just say that leaves lots of opportunity for reading in 2022!</p>
<h4 id="top-non-fiction">Top Non-Fiction</h4>
<p>Hard to rank these, but some very good ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>All About Love</em>, bell hooks (RIP)</li>
<li><em>The Order of Time</em>, Carlo Rovelli</li>
<li><em>The Unbearable Wholeness of Being</em>, Ilia Delio</li>
<li><em>Redeeming Power</em>, Diane Langberg</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these, hooks spoke about love in beautiful ways, Langberg spoke truth about the mess in the evangelical church, and Rovelli and Delio made my mind hurt in the best ways talking about time and quantum theory and evolution.</p>
<h4 id="top-religion--theology">Top Religion / Theology</h4>
<p>This is a big enough chunk of reading to be its own category. Recommended here:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A More Christlike Word</em>, Bradley Jersak</li>
<li><em>Jesus of the East</em>, Phuc Luu</li>
<li><em>Latina Evangelicas</em>, Loida I. Martell, Zaida Maldonado Perez, Elizabeth Conde-Frazier</li>
<li><em>The Making of Biblical Womanhood</em>, Beth Allison Barr</li>
</ol>
<p>The gentle Canadian Jersak again focuses us on Jesus; Luu explores the similarities between a Jesus-centered Christianity and the tenets of Eastern spirituality; Martell, Perez, and Conde-Frazier write a short systematic theology from a Latina perspective, and Barr writes a challenging history of “Biblical womanhood”.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="top-fiction">Top Fiction</h4>
<p>This is fiction that I <em>read</em> this year, not necessarily published this year. I always have catching up to do…</p>
<ol>
<li><em>The Sparrow</em>, Mary Doria Russell</li>
<li><em>Transcendent Kingdom</em>, Yaa Gyasi</li>
<li><em>The Just City</em>, Jo Walton</li>
</ol>
<p>I could order the first two either way. <em>The Sparrow</em> is broadly about Jesuits sending missionaries to an alien planet and more directly about outsiders assuming they know best and wrestling with what God really wants. <em>Transcendent Kingdom</em> is a stunning exploration of race, depression, addiction, and immigration. And <em>The Just City</em> explores what would happen if a city were set up based on the principles of Plato’s <em>Republic</em>. So much creativity and imagination, so little reading time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h4 id="books-that-you-probably-wont-entirely-agree-with-but-will-challenge-you">Books that you probably won’t entirely agree with but will challenge you</h4>
<p><em>How to Be an Antiracist</em>, Ibram X. Kendi — Is there a more controversial topic the past couple years in this country than race? Kendi speaks strongly about the need to be actively anti-racist, in a “if you’re not actively with us then you’re against us” sort of way. Challenging.</p>
<p><em>The Inescapable Love of God</em>, Thomas Talbott — Talbott (an ethics professor and theologian) makes his case for universal reconciliation in Christ. I found his arguments compelling. I read through the back-and-forth that he and John Piper had after the fact; I found Piper’s arguments much less compelling.</p>
<p><em>The Right to Sex</em>, Amia Srinivasan — Sharp, wonderfully-written essays by a young woman exploring the dynamics and ethics of sex and power in the 21st century.</p>
<p><em>Queer Theology</em>, Linn Marie Tonstad — I’m sorry to confess that I would’ve been highly unlikely to pick up a book titled “Queer Theology” if my book club hadn’t pushed me to do so. Boy am I glad I did, though. I hope that I have grown enough this year that I would not be put off again.</p>

<p>So that’s my 2021 reading sorted. Pretty sure I could read 80 books in 2022 and still not have my to-read shelf cleared off. Happy reading, friends!</p>

			 <p>I was introduced to <a href="https://christogenesis.org/about/ilia-delio/">Dr. Ilia Delio</a> a couple weeks ago on a podcast. Her thoughts about God, evolution, and the quantum realm fascinated me such that I went right to Amazon and bought three of her books. This morning I started in on the first one (<em><a href="https://amzn.to/3raqumM">The Unbearable Wholeness of Being</a></em>) and ran across this stunning thought in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raimon Panikkar said that when theology is divorced from cosmology, we no longer have a living God but an idea of God. God becomes a thought that can be accepted or rejected, rather than the experience of divine ultimacy. Because theology has not developed in tandem with science (or science in tandem with theology) since the Middle Ages, we have an enormous gap between the transcendent dimension of human existence (the religious dimension) and the meaning of physical reality as science understands it (the material dimension). This gap underlies our global problems today, from the environmental crisis to economic disparity and the denigration of women.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Ilia Delio, <em>The Unbearable Wholeness of Being</em>, p. xix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She’s going to have to do some convincing for me to accept the conclusion of the last sentence, but the bigger thought that our theology needs to continue to develop along with our cosmology so that they can be coupled in a way that God is more than an “idea” in the modern age is one I’m going to be chewing on for a while. Looking forward to the rest of this book!</p>

			 <p>Richard Beck, <a href="https://richardbeck.substack.com/p/deep-meaning-self-esteem-and-nationalism">on his Substack today</a>, on American nationalism resulting from the need for deep meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;for most of human history, we achieved deep meaning by a connection with an ancestral people. Our tribe, kin, and clan. These relations gave us a history and roots.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But with the rise of the modern nation state, especially with such a rootless nation of immigrants like America, our identities have become increasingly associated less with a tribe than a state, a flag, a country. I am who I am&ndash;I matter, I have worth&ndash;because I&rsquo;m an <em>American</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an easy observation that American nationalism is characterized by pride in the country, but Beck&rsquo;s piece pushed me to think more about how Americans, and especially <em>Christian</em> Americans, could be helped away from the more vitriolic forms of nationalism by finding more meaning in other parts of their self-identity—perhaps specifically in their Christian faith.</p>
<p>Beck, again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Without deep meaning Americans achieve self-esteem via the status of the nation.</em> You elevate the stature of the nation and you elevate the worth, value, and dignity of its citizens. Make America great and you make its people great. There is a primal pull here, rooted deep in the limbic system. It&rsquo;s not abstract, but a raw, visceral ground of dignity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can I encourage other Christians to find more deep meaning and identity in their faith instead of (or even more than) their country?</p>

The splendidly mosaiced church, built in the fourth or fifth century C.E., is being hailed as one of the earliest and largest Christian basilicas found in Israel.

			 <p>The last couple days I’ve been reading a book of theology by an author I was heretofore unfamiliar with. I know and trust a couple of the guys who endorsed it, though, so I plowed in and I’m generally enjoying it and on board with what the author has to say. Curious to find out more about him, I headed over to his website, which then pointed me to his Twitter. And what I found there? Oh dear.</p>
<p>This author of a thoughtful book championing love as the highest law has a Twitter account full of vitriol against our current President, frequent retweets of the loudest and most thoughtless conservative pundits, and images comparing vaccine mandates to Nazism. I was stunned by the incongruity. The people I know who endorsed his book (written in 2017) are thoughtful, gentle people who aren’t rabid politically in either direction. So what’s up with this guy? Even more, his website offers the reader a chance to sign up for his “Discipleship Course”. Do I really want to be discipled by someone like that? And, more challengingly, what do I do with his book when his recent demeanor seems so troublesome?</p>
<p>I tweeted briefly about my quandary, and my friend Matt (a teacher who always seems to ask good questions) asked my thoughts about learning from the <em>approach/perspective</em> rather than the <em>person</em>. And that got enough thoughts going that they merited a blog post rather than a tweet thread.</p>
<p>How can or should we separate the teaching from the teacher?</p>
<p>On one hand, Jesus was the only perfect teacher, so literally anyone else that we learn from is going to have issues. And yet there are those who have taught truth whose behavior is so disqualifying that it brings into question the integrity of everything they taught.</p>
<p>That behavior could be unrelated to their teaching or their methods. J. H. Yoder was the classic example of this quandary. It is perhaps easier, though, to think abstractly about an obscure Mennonite ethicist who abused women than it is to consider examples more fresh and prominent in our memory: men like Ravi Zacharias, Bill Hybels, or Jean Vanier. Did (or should have) their behavior have disqualified them from teaching? Absolutely. When we find out about their behavior after absorbing their teaching, how should we reconsider it? That’s hard.</p>
<p>Then we have the case of this author where the behavior directly brings me to question the teacher, because his online behavior seems so out of line with the principles he’s teaching, and because the judgment and logic and reasoning skills he’s displaying on Twitter make me wonder whether I should question the judgment, logic, and reasoning in his book.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I need to evaluate the teaching separately from the teacher. But if I start seeing a pattern where people who teach these things also act that way, I want to factor that in to my evaluation. Correlation isn’t causation… sometimes.</p>
<p>Then there’s the question of discipleship. As a Christian, my aspiration is to be a “little Christ”. If I disciple myself by attending to teachers who are impulsive, caustic, and illogical — even if they are teaching true principles in that way — I shouldn’t be surprised if I learn to be impulsive, caustic, and illogical myself.</p>
<p>But what about the flip side of that? Surely just because a teacher is kind, gentle, patient, loving, and self-controlled doesn’t mean they’re correct, does it? Well… maybe not. But what does Jesus say in Matthew 7?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.  A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  Thus you will know them [prophets, teachers] by their fruits.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Matthew 7:16-20, NRSV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of this particular book and author, I think I’m going to end up on the side of agreeing with the book even though the author is problematic. Partly because I think the principles hold up regardless of the teacher, but also partly because there are other teachers I know who are saying the same thing and who provide very compelling examples of living out the fruit of the Spirit and Jesus’ kingdom principles. But am I gonna follow the guy on Twitter to keep learning from him? Nope.</p>

			 <p>I have badly neglected recommending any reading so far this year. I have read plenty of books - looks like 54 at the moment - but it&rsquo;s definitely time for some recommendations.</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction</h3>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3jVkeLn">The Sparrow</a></em> - Mary Doria Russell</strong></p>
<p>This one is apparently considered a sci-fi / fantasy classic at this point, which makes me wonder why I hadn&rsquo;t read it until this year. A story that combines humans encountering alien culture with an exploration of faith and theodicy&hellip; phew. It&rsquo;s a good one. Well worth a read.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3E47wST">The Just City</a></em> - Jo Walton</strong></p>
<p>The premise here: what if some Greek gods selected people from throughout history and brought them to a specific place and time to set up a community based as closely as possible on Plato&rsquo;s <em>Republic</em>? I&rsquo;ll admit that it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve read Plato, but this exploration of how Plato&rsquo;s ideas might (or might not) work out in practice was quite fascinating. Oh, and what happens when the cleaning and maintenance robots become sentient?</p>
<h3 id="non-fiction-ok-so-mostly-for-me-this-means-theology">Non-Fiction (ok, so mostly for me this means theology&hellip;)</h3>
<p>So many options here. I&rsquo;ve been participating in a twice-a-month book club this year - and it&rsquo;s a new book every time, so that&rsquo;s a lot of reading - which has brought me to some very insightful authors who aren&rsquo;t all white guys. A couple I can recommend:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Violence of Love</em> - Oscar Romero</strong></p>
<p>This book is a collection of excerpts from Romero&rsquo;s sermons and other talks in the late 1970s. While in my earlier days I have been steered away from him as a sort of dangerous, socialist, liberation theologian, what I found was a deep love for the message of the Gospels and a heart full of God&rsquo;s care and love for the poor and oppressed. It&rsquo;s easy reading, and well worth it. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.romerotrust.org.uk/documents/books/violenceoflove.pdf">free PDF</a> you can legally download, too.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3nhQ1bN">Latina Evangelicas: A Theological Survey from the Margins</a></em> - Loida I. Martell, Zaida Maldonado Perez, Elizabeth Conde-Frazier</strong></p>
<p>A short work of systematic theology by three Latina women. It kicks off in an unusual place for a systematic theology: a long discussion of the Holy Spirit. This book has an awareness of community and community interpretation of Scripture that I found particularly helpful, too.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2022/latinas-evangelicas.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="next-up">Next Up&hellip;</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading Father James Martin&rsquo;s <em>My Life with the Saints</em>, which is part memoir and part introduction to a bunch of saints throughout history. If I had finished it I might have listed it up above. I&rsquo;m only a third of the way through but it&rsquo;s been quite enjoyable so far.</p>

<p><em>In case the tweet gets deleted: an embedded tweet from John Rogers (@jonrog1) saying: &ldquo;People mocking 1/6 cops' emotions and Simone Biles Olympic decision really brings home that we&rsquo;re way past partisan divide and dealing with the fact that somehow, over the last half century, our predominantly religious culture raised a hundred million Americans without empathy.&quot;</em></p>
<p>This tweet has made the viral rounds in just the past 24 hours, and it&rsquo;s got me thinking, because I resonate strongly with the message. I have seen it very frequently among the Christian circles—particularly the evangelical Christian circles—that I have lived in my entire life. The disdainful comments about people on food stamps. The anger at immigrants that &ldquo;won&rsquo;t learn the language&rdquo;. Snarky, hateful comments about “the gays”. An insistence that poor mothers should get benefits cut off if they keep having children. And on and on and on.</p>
<p>What makes it more jarring is that these same Christians, when provided with a specific <em>in-person</em> opportunity to show empathy, will almost always respond in very compassionate, empathetic ways. They will give money, make meals, house people, literally give you the shirt off their back. But when talking about a generic &ldquo;them&rdquo;, or an individual that they don&rsquo;t know personally, that sense of compassion and empathy quickly disappears.</p>
<p>Why is this so? Why do we have such a failure of compassionate imagination that when we think of the generic other, we assume the worst and by default make a critique?</p>
<p>As I ponder this question, my mind is drawn to the incongruity that has nagged at me a thousand times in a thousand different sermons and &lsquo;gospel presentations&rsquo;. Why is it that the same people who will insist that salvation is 100% God&rsquo;s work, that we are wretched, helpless, despicable people, and that every act is determined by God, will also be the loud voices preaching that you better shape up your life, and that if your sin doesn&rsquo;t bother you enough, you’d better think hard and long about whether you&rsquo;re &ldquo;really saved&rdquo;? (As if that theological framework would allow that you could do anything <em>about</em> that status, anyway.)</p>
<p>Then I connect a dot or two related to the predominant theme of &ldquo;the gospel&rdquo; from that vein of evangelical Christianity: penal substitutionary atonement. Specifically, that God&rsquo;s wrath against sin is burning so hot that if you (yes, you) don&rsquo;t accept the gift of salvation He offers, He is right and just and praiseworthy to torture you for all eternity. (Sure, there&rsquo;s a hint more nuance in the systematic theology books, but this is the way you hear it from the pulpit. And Sunday School. And VBS. And AWANA. And on and on.)</p>
<h3 id="a-conundrum">A conundrum</h3>
<p>So what happens when an evangelical tries to make all of these line up? Maybe evangelicals, when they look at these &ldquo;other&rdquo; people, subconsciously find it easier to live with the belief that God will torture those &ldquo;other&rdquo; people eternally if they can point to reasons why those &ldquo;other&rdquo; people are bad. They will deserve it, after all—that little Gospel presentation tells me so. After all, there has to be <em>something</em> different between me and them, right? Because even though that Gospel presentation tells me it&rsquo;s 100% God and 0% me, there has to be <em>something</em> better about me, right? Because otherwise why is it great and good and praiseworthy that God arbitrarily chose to reward <em>me</em>, but to eternally torture millions of others?</p>
<h3 id="an-alternative-idea">An alternative idea…</h3>
<p>What if, on the other hand, I understand salvation as being a part of God’s redemptive story for all people and creation? An act of restoration that will, in C. S. Lewis’ words from Narnia, make all sad things become untrue? A cosmic work of reconciliation that will restore right relationships between all living things? And that Jesus’ death was not God punishing God to pay for some select few a penalty that God arbitrarily set in place, but rather was a demonstration of God’s love for all creation, proof that the effects of sin in the world will bring death to even the most undeserving, but that God’s redemptive power is stronger even than death itself?</p>
<p>With <em>that</em> view in mind, might I (who up until very recently claimed to be an evangelical Christian) have more empathy and compassion for those struggling with the effects of a broken world? Might I see them — even the general, “other” them — first and foremost as image bearers in need of restoration? Might I see that the good works I can do to help those in need are not some work of “social justice” at odds with “the gospel” but rather <em>the very foreworking of reconciliation and restoration that Jesus will eventually return to complete</em>?</p>
<h3 id="a-closing-comparison">A closing comparison</h3>
<p>Ever since dispensationalism took hold, the evangelical church has looked askance at themes of environmental care. Not everyone would say it so bluntly, but the underlying theme is something like this: <em>if it’s all going to burn eventually anyway, why does it matter so much if we take care of it</em>? It doesn’t feel like a stretch to think that for many, the same principle might unconsciously apply to the general “other” person: if they’re going to burn in hell for eternity anyway, why should we care now?</p>
<p>May the church repent and return to compassion, empathy, and care for everyone who God loves — which is to say, for everyone.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Richard Beck is on a roll this week with a short series on reading the Bible. In <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/04/reading-bible-part-1-make-your-call.html">Part #1</a> yesterday he states premise #1: &ldquo;Interpreting is inescapable.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the hard work of Biblical study, put in the time and effort to explore, but don&rsquo;t think you can avoid, in the final analysis, the necessity of making a call. So make it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today in <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/04/reading-bible-part-2-god-has-your-back.html">Part #2</a> he highlights the terror that can come when the self-awareness of interpretation is paired with a belief that God will judge you if you get it wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hermeneutical Self-Awareness + Judgmental God = A Whole Lot of Anxiety</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I ever verbalized this thought myself, but I think it drove a lot of my study and reading in my 20s and 30s. Here&rsquo;s how Beck describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biblical interpretation is so anxiety-inducing because it&rsquo;s viewed as so high stakes. Your eternal destiny hangs in the balance, so you have to get it right. And yet, given the hermeneutical situation, you lack any firm guarantees you&rsquo;ve made the right choice. The whole thing is a neurotic spiritual nightmare. In fact, it&rsquo;s this nightmare that keeps many Christians from stepping into self-awareness to own and admit their own hermeneutics. It&rsquo;s more comforting to remain oblivious and un-self-aware. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This put me in mind of <a href="/18/05/albert-mohler-the-sbc-and-metoo/">a piece I wrote a few years ago</a> where, as an aside, I mentioned that I&rsquo;m certainly wrong about some percentage of beliefs, but I can&rsquo;t tell you which ones. Turns out I was interacting with a Richard Beck piece in that one, too. So what do you do? How do you get your way out of Beck&rsquo;s &ldquo;neurotic spiritual nightmare&rdquo;?</p>
<p>By reevaluating one of the terms in the equation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I told my students, You have to believe that God&rsquo;s got your back, that, yes, you might make a mistake. But that mistake isn&rsquo;t determinative or damning. Just be faithful and humble. You don&rsquo;t have to have all the correct answers to be loved by your Father. Each of us will carry into heaven a raft of confusions, errors, and misinterpretations of Scripture. It&rsquo;s unavoidable. We will not score 100% on the final exam. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But don&rsquo;t worry. Let your heart be at rest. God&rsquo;s got your back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I like to paraphrase something Robert F. Capon said in <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780802842220">Between Noon and Three</a></em>: yes, I&rsquo;m assuming that God is at heart loving and gracious. Because, let&rsquo;s face it: if God is a bastard, we&rsquo;re all screwed.</p>

			 <p>This last year has felt a lot like death.</p>
<p>We’ve had a pandemic sweep the world, and in this country had our leaders fail to lead, instead spreading rumors and assigning blame. Hundreds of thousands are unnecessarily dead. We’ve necessarily stayed cut off from work, family, friends, school, church, and travel plans to protect ourselves and each other. It feels a lot like death.</p>
<p>We left our church last year. This year I‘ve been watching as the evangelical church in America consistently chooses the hope of political power over truth and justice. Chooses to side with abusers rather than victims. Chooses to marginalize women in the name of Biblical literalism. Chooses to persecute LGBTQIA people rather than love and accept them. Chooses “personal freedom” rather than taking basic steps to protect others amid the pandemic. It feels a lot like death.</p>
<p>In August last year we had a derecho destroy our city. The majority of our tree canopy is gone. Everyone had house damage. Our power was out for almost two weeks. Eight months later, I don’t have to drive further than my own street to see houses still missing siding and fences, roofs with tarps where shingles should be. In my own yard where three old friendly trees once stood, all that remains are ragged scars and chips left by a hurried stump grinder. It feels a lot like death.</p>
<p>There are other stories too personal to post. Stories that aren’t mine to tell. Stories that have kept us awake at night, on the floor in desperation, in helpless gnawing realization of things that aren’t alright. That has often felt a lot like death.</p>
<p>This is the first Easter in my memory that I haven’t been to church to celebrate. That, too, feeels like death.</p>
<p>Somehow, through all this, Jesus still holds on to me. I don’t know how. Even after I put away the fear wrought by legalism, after the habits are ripped away, after the culture that taught me Jesus for 40 years has turned from Him in the name of power and freedom, Jesus is still there. Faithfully loving and sustaining me. Faithfully promising that, in the end, this mess will be redeemed.</p>
<p>In this year that has felt a lot like death I will cling to the hope that Jesus is risen. Somehow, He feels a lot like life.</p>

<p>The past couple months I&rsquo;ve been participating in a reading group hosted by Matt Tebbe. (Matt leads an Anglican church plant in the Indianapolis area.) This group, framed around &ldquo;Reading for the Sake of Others&rdquo;, is focused on reading outside of the usual conservative white male authors that fill our reading piles. The intention is not that we will agree with everything we read—indeed, if we do, we&rsquo;re probably not reading widely enough—but to expand our horizons, to acknowledge our blind spots, and to stretch us at least a little.</p>
<p>Our first book in March, then, is one I would likely have never picked up otherwise: <em>Queer Theology</em> by Yale Divinity School professor Linn Marie Tonstad. It&rsquo;s a short book—less than 200 pages—but provided me a lot to think about. I won&rsquo;t try to summarize it all here, but wanted to recount some thoughts that I scribbled out on Twitter last night.</p>
<ol>
<li>I appreciate the focus in queer theology on the reality of embodied existence. Our embodied experience is complex, messy, and should not be ignored. We should pay more attention to what it means for Jesus to have been incarnate.</li>
<li>I appreciated the thought that, though we might hope or imagine otherwise, we are not &ldquo;self-transparent, rational, autonomous individuals&rdquo;—i.e., that we are to some extent unable to make choices that determine our outcomes. This means that the categories that we learn and filter our view of life through are so built-in that they are beyond our control and will inevitably affect our view of everything, but especially of the non-normative.</li>
<li>I appreciate an approach that acknowledges that there <em>are</em> queer members of the body of Christ, and works from that given to then think through what this might mean about Christ&rsquo;s and the church&rsquo;s nature.</li>
<li>I am challenged by the assertion that if (since) Christianity is &ldquo;a story in which each person is the object of God&rsquo;s care, attention, and love&rdquo;, then Christians should reckon more seriously about those implications, aprticularly regarding politics, economics, and sexuality. This quote reminded me a lot of reading Robert Capon: &ldquo;The question is this: what does an economy of infinite, inexhaustible love look like?&rdquo;</li>
<li>I am conflicted about the queer theology assertion that our sexual self and experience is so fundamental to the experience of being a spiritual human being. The theology I have grown up learning is heteronormative, insisting that other experiences/desires are sinful. Yet, it&rsquo;s hard to deny the assertion that our sexual selves are fundamental to our human experience, and thus to our spiritual being as well.</li>
<li>Finally, I <em>really</em> appreciate the language of &ldquo;human thriving&rdquo; to describe that which God wants and we should strive for. I have read others (I forget who) who describe sin as that which is contrary to human flourishing, and that&rsquo;s been a helpful frame for me to think through sin, the result of sin, and the goodness of the law.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am definitely looking forward to the group discussion on this one next week!</p>

			 <p>Rush Limbaugh passed away today at age 70.</p>
<p>I spent countless hours listening to his radio show as a pre-teen, teenager, and into early adulthood, largely absorbing both his Republican political views and his cruel, snarky attitude toward those who disagreed with him. I tried calling in to the show on multiple occasions. (I remember getting through to the call screener once, but never got on the air.) I recorded some of the political spoof songs he played and memorized the lyrics because I thought they were funny. (The spoof of &ldquo;Bette Davis Eyes&rdquo; as &ldquo;Billy Clinton Thighs&rdquo; to commemorate the jogging President&rsquo;s short shorts is still in my head today.) I laughed as he called people names and ridiculed people who weren&rsquo;t like him: Democrats, environmentalists, feminists, immigrants, LTBTQIA people&hellip;</p>
<p>Rush made it easy to dismiss people who disagreed with you, and made sure you knew who those people were. I carried those views and attitudes well into adulthood. If you search back far enough you will find posts on my blog here that reflect that sort of snarky and uncaring attitude toward political opponents. I&rsquo;ve spent the last decade or more regretting and repenting of those words, actions, and attitudes.</p>
<p>Rush caused a lot of people a lot of pain over his lifetime in talk radio. I am glad that his passing means he will stop causing people more pain. Sadly, the effects will linger far longer than his voice did on the radio waves. He had a massive amount of talent and opportunity to do a lot of good for a lot of people. It&rsquo;s sad that he chose not to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of understandable pain and bitterness on Twitter this afternoon as people react to Rush&rsquo;s passing. I don&rsquo;t want to criticize those reactions. Pain has to be acknowledged to be worked through. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of comments about Rush now in eternity finding out how wrong he was and some sense of justice that he might be in hell. I get it. I do.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t gloat in his passing, and I can&rsquo;t hope for his eternal torment. Rush was a human created in God&rsquo;s image the same as everyone else, and he deserves that respect even if he refused it to others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful of some sort of universal reconciliation through Christ. I know you can interpret the Bible to say otherwise, but after a decade of reading on the topic that&rsquo;s where I land today. Does my sense of justice think Rush deserves punishment? Yep. But if I can hope for something more beautiful, it&rsquo;s for a bitter old man with a lifetime of hate coming to sorrowful repentance and being eternally reconciled to Democrats, feminists, immigrants, gays, lesbians, transsexuals, and everyone else he hurt through the transforming love of God.</p>
<p>It feels wrong somehow to say &ldquo;rest in peace&rdquo; for a guy who caused so much discord. Maybe instead I can wish that he will rest in a discomfort that will lead to repentance and eternal reconciliation. Then I can pray for and work toward healing for those he hurt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting the message of reconciliation to us. So we are ambassadors for Christ, since God is making his appeal through us; we entreat you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

			 <p><a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/02/how-to-detox-evangelical-christianity.html">Richard Beck has a wonderful post up today</a>, describing American evangelicalism as &ldquo;addicted to politics&rdquo;, with a need to detox. He lists &ldquo;three simple steps&rdquo; to get free and sober of the addiction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Do not vote in an election for the next ten years, or even ever again.</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Basically, go cold turkey. An evangelical who stops voting is like an addict flushing pills down the toilet or emptying bottles down the sink. Break the connection between God and country. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<strong>2. Abstain from or delete social media, cable TV and talk radio.</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Stop going to the drug dealers. Avoid the street corners where they are pushing their pills. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<strong>3. Invest in an apolitical local ministry that cares for the hurting or marginalized.</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Sobriety requires a new lifestyle. So stop haunting the crack houses. Find a service, organization, or ministry in your town that cares for hurting or marginalized people. Invest all the hours you used to spend on social media into looking some hurting person directly in the face. Keep doing that until you know her or his name. And keep going until the names become your friends. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beck notes that these same steps would be appropriate for politically-addicted progressives, too. I dunno if I&rsquo;d call them &ldquo;easy&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s helpful to think about the kind of radical steps that would show the problem were being taken seriously.</p>

			 <p>Over the past month or two I have been making a renewed effort to engage in good faith political discussions my Facebook friends. I had been hoping that since the election was over and there are a handful of key points that are very obviously matters of fact, maybe I could reason with my friends through those topics.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians says that love hopes all things, and my rationale went along these lines: I love these people, and I hope that eventually their eyes could be opened to the truth rather than the lies they’ve been chasing. My engaging and speaking truth could be a pathway toward that realization for them. After all, if everybody who disagrees with them just gives up and disengages, the echo chambers just get worse, right?</p>
<p>It’s been an exhausting month. Maybe I’m just really bad at this. Maybe people are far more entrenched in lies than I wanted to believe. Maybe Facebook is really not a good platform for those conversations. But whatever the case, I got nowhere with my arguments, got called a bunch of names, and my stress level went through the roof every time I was inexorably drawn to tap the Facebook app icon.</p>
<p>So last night enough was enough. I went through Facebook and unfriended a bunch of people who aren’t really in-person friends, and unfollowed a whole bunch of people who I do know in person. I still love these people and pray and hope that their eyes would be opened, but <em>this</em> can’t be the way. At least I hope that if they someday reach a point where they see things differently and want someone to talk to about it, they’ll remember me as someone who’s willing to talk.</p>

			 <p>One of my favorite 2020 discoveries (which, ok, only came out in 2020, so I was on it from the beginning) is the <em><a href="https://yammpod.substack.com/">Young Adult Movie Ministry Podcast</a></em>. A production of Sam Thielman and Alissa Wilkinson, two journalists and movie critics, YAMMPOD approaches movies from a sort of post-evangelical perspective. In Episode 1 of the podcast, Alissa notes that she was homeschooled through her youth, and then says that when asked about being homeschooled, her usual response is that she was <em>very</em> homeschooled. I resemble that remark.</p>
<p>The podcast moves quickly and is rife with references to other movies, books, and other cultural artifacts. The podcast show notes are perfunctory but not particularly detailed. Hmmmm, I thought, I know how to fill <em>that</em> gap.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://yammpod.info">YAMMPOD.info</a>, where I&rsquo;m creating a post per episode to itemize all the movies and references that the hosts and guests drop. 28 episodes in, this is kinda fun.</p>
<p>If I were to recommend one particularly meaningful episode, I&rsquo;d go to <a href="https://yammpod.info/episode-21/">Episode 21, &ldquo;Bread Alone&rdquo;</a>, with guest Jeffrey Overstreet discussing <em>Babette&rsquo;s Feast</em>. Other standouts are <a href="https://yammpod.info/episode-6/">Episode 6, &ldquo;Sullied by Monotheism&rdquo;</a>, with the hilarious Lyz Lenz discussing <em>The Story of Ruth</em> and <a href="https://yammpod.info/episode-12/">Episode 12, &ldquo;Noir 101&rdquo;</a>, with guest Jamelle Bouie addressing not just <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> but the whole <em>noir</em> genre.</p>

    we were like those who dream.<br>
2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Psalm 126 has been chasing me around this past year. I read it shortly after the COVID shutdowns started in March 2020. Our church had just stopped meeting in person on Sundays. I was the music ministry leader, and I made a mental note to remember this passage for when we started meeting again. Once things got back to normal, I thought, that first Sunday back would indeed feel like a dream, with good cause to rejoice.</p>
<p>Three months later our church&rsquo;s insistence on a mask-optional reopening was the last straw in a multi-year struggle over whether to stay. I resigned from my music ministry duties and let the pastor know we&rsquo;d be looking for a new church once things reopened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now January 2021 and we&rsquo;re still waiting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 Restore our fortunes, O Lord,<br>
    like the watercourses in the Negeb.<br>
5 May those who sow in tears<br>
    reap with shouts of joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This past summer a friend invited us to join their church group&rsquo;s Zoom meetings. They&rsquo;ve been a godsend this year — a regular time of discussion, prayer, and Bible study with some likeminded people. It&rsquo;s not the same as a local in-person meeting, but I&rsquo;m already anticipating the loss when they start meeting in person again and the Zoom is no longer available to us.</p>
<p>2020 was hard for lots of reasons, in lots of ways; some of them public, some personal. One Monday last month during Advent, the pastor of our online group had us read this psalm. It felt different. There&rsquo;s still a lot of going out weeping, a lot of sowing tears. We&rsquo;re still in verses 4 and 5. Searching for hope, praying for joy on the other side of all this sadness. It&rsquo;s January. The days are short and cold. I always feel fragile in January; this year even more so.</p>
<p>At this point in a post like this there are traditionally some words of hope, something about spring coming and things getting better. But I don&rsquo;t really have those words in my heart today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful there&rsquo;s still a verse left in the psalm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 Those who go out weeping,<br>
    bearing the seed for sowing,<br>
shall come home with shouts of joy,<br>
    carrying their sheaves.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Another year, another review of my annual reading. The mess that was 2020 definitely affected my reading - there were a couple months in there where I simply didn’t have the mental energy for anything challenging. Nevertheless, I completed 60+ books, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?ref=nav_mybooks&amp;shelf=2020-reads">logged as usual over on Goodreads</a>.</p>
<p>Last year in my roundup I said I should try to read some more engaging fiction in 2020. I wasn’t very successful there - only 23 novels (out of 64 books) this year. I did read a few very good ones, though, so I guess that’s something. I only read 13 female authors all year&hellip; I could get more rounded there.</p>
<h3 id="fiction">Fiction</h3>
<p>Some of my favorite fiction of the year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sing, Unburied, Sing</em> by Jemsyn Ward</li>
<li><em>A Children’s Bible</em> by Lydia Millet</li>
<li><em>Children of Time</em> by Adrian Tchaikovsky</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-fiction">Non-Fiction</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Caste: The Origin of our Discontents</em> by Isabel Wilkerson</li>
<li><em>Jesus and John Wayne</em> by Kristen Kobes Du Mez</li>
<li><em>The Education of an Idealist</em> by Samantha Power</li>
<li><em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> by Bessel van der Horst</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not lost on me as I list these out that many of my favorites of the year were written by women. That could be a clue to me that a well-rounded reading list will also be an engaging reading list.</p>
<h3 id="really-long-books">Really Long Books</h3>
<p>It’s entirely possible my book count would’ve gone up if I’d not read some <em>really long</em> books&hellip; but then I would’ve also missed some really good books. Notable really long books this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A Secular Age</em> by Charles Taylor (896 pages)</li>
<li><em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em> by Rebecca West (1181 pages)</li>
<li><em>The New Testament in its World</em> by. N. T. Wright and Michael F. Bird (992 pages)</li>
<li><em>Crucifixion of the Warrior God</em> by Gregory Boyd (1492 pages)</li>
<li><em>Dominion</em> by Tom Holland (a paltry 624 pages)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe my goal for 2021 should be some shorter books&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I’m feeling particularly crusty today. In the spirit of efficiency, I expect I can write a bunch of bullets here such that everyone can find something that they disagree with.</p>
<h3 id="on-politics">On politics:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to subvert our legitimate election results are traitorous, and the Republican politicians unwilling to call him out on it are spineless opportunists who aren’t worthy to be described as leaders.</li>
<li>The Democratic Party&rsquo;s insistence on making “any abortion, any time” table stakes for being a Democratic candidate is holding the party back from majority rule for the next 50 years.</li>
<li>The Trump administration’s failure to govern with any priorities other than “what’s best for Trump” makes it the worst presidential administration in the history of the Republic.</li>
<li>If the Democrats want to claim any sort of moral high ground, they’re going to have to get their own house in order. It’s time to stop trotting out Bill Clinton, even if he is a southern Democrat who gives a good speech.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-the-evangelical-church">On the evangelical church:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I won&rsquo;t claim to be an evangelical any more, but I&rsquo;m clearly still working through a bunch of stuff.</li>
<li>The evangelical church’s focus on patriarchy (dressed up as “complementary gender roles”) has deprived the church of more than half its voice.</li>
<li>The church’s continued trouble with tolerating and covering up sexual abuse would be significantly lessened if women were afforded the same church leadership roles as men.</li>
<li>The huge emphasis on the LGBTQ discussion within the evangelical church is the result of fundamentalist leaders desperately clinging to the same magisterial authority of Scripture interpretation that the Reformation protested against 500 years ago. Once the commoners realize the Holy Spirit enables them to understand the Scripture on their own and they&rsquo;re not automatically going to hell if they disagree with the church&rsquo;s teaching, the power is broken.</li>
<li>8 months of not attending worship services (thanks, pandemic) has made it clear how important being able to attend worship services is.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-moral-issues">On moral issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; people don&rsquo;t really, at a core level, believe that an early-term abortion is the same, morally, as killing an infant after birth. If they really did, they would take stronger action.</li>
<li>Nobody <em>wants</em> to get a late-term abortion. The ones that tragically may be needed are worked out in painful circumstances that won&rsquo;t benefit from laws that would force jumping through a lot of hoops.</li>
<li>Everyone should want the number of abortions to go down. This would happen with better access to contraceptives, better sex education, and better support for pregnant women and young parents.</li>
<li>LGBTQ people deserve the same rights, protections, and affirmations as anyone else. Including in the church. Yes, I&rsquo;ve read all the verses and heard all the arguments. But I&rsquo;ve met LGBTQ brothers and sisters who clearly love Jesus and have the Holy Spirit working in their lives. And then I go to Peter&rsquo;s words in Acts 11 after preaching to <!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Gentiles.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, &lsquo;John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit&rsquo;. If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Acts 11:15-17, NRSV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The arguments can be complicated. As Robert Capon says in <em>Between Noon and Three</em>, if God is a bastard, we&rsquo;re all in trouble. So in the end, I&rsquo;m going to rely on the hope that God is loving and gracious and he can sort it out.</p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me.</p>

			 <p>Richard Beck has <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2020/11/common-cause-on-history-justice-hope.html">a fantastic post out today</a> reflecting on a passage from Barack Obama’s recent memoir and how materialism affects our ability to find common cause across ideological boundaries. Here’s the Obama quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T]emperamentally I am sympathetic to a certain strain of conservatism in the sense that I’m not just a materialist. I’m not an economic determinist. I think it’s important, but I think there are things other than stuff and money and income—the religious critique of modern society, that we’ve lost that sense of community.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Here’s my optimistic view. This gives me some hope that it’s possible to make common cause with a certain strand of evangelical or conservative who essentially wants to restore a sense of meaning and purpose and spirituality…a person who believes in notions like stewardship and caring for the least of these: They share this with those on the left who have those same nonmaterialistic impulses but express themselves through a nonreligious prism.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Barack Obama, from <em>A Promised Land</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beck contrasts Obama’s Christian non-materialistic optimism with the atheistic, materialistic pessimism of Ta-Nehisi Coates. Hope, and a pragmatic politics, says Beck, are rooted in a non-materialistic view of reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/04dc11f64c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I have leaned politically left in the past decade but been frustrated by the inability of much of the progressive left to share a hopeful view. Beck’s paragraph here turned a light bulb on for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Obama is correct, there are shared values between the materialists and the non-materialists. And those shared values lead us to think we can share &ldquo;common cause.&rdquo; We want to. And we try. All the time. But that &ldquo;common cause&rdquo; is perpetually undermined as these values are embedded within two very different metaphysical worldviews. In the non-materialist worldview, grace and hope season hate toward political enemies and impatience with the lack of progress in our lifetimes. <strong>Non-materialists can play the long game, graciously and hopefully, <em>because they believe in a long game</em>.</strong> By contrast, non-materialists [sic, Beck clearly means ‘materialists’ here], since there is no long game and the winners write the history books, will be driven to hate those who oppose them and become violently impatient in the face of conversation, compromise, and incrementalism. Given the pressing urgency of the Revolution hope and grace are moral failures, each dampening the passions needed to change the world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is as good an explanation as I’ve seen for the tension between those two groups on the left. Count me among the hopeful non-materialists.</p>
<p>If you go read <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2020/11/common-cause-on-history-justice-hope.html">Beck’s whole post</a> (which you should), you’ll find he also has a couple rather (to borrow a word from my friend Dan) spicy things to say about conservative evangelicals. While I feel his frustration, I wish he would’ve spelled out his reasoning a little bit more to justify such strong words. It would be fascinating to explore why conservative evangelicals, non-materialists in Beck’s schema, seem to so frequently use the materialist’s political playbook. Of course as frequently as Dr. Beck blogs, that piece may already be on its way.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/11/16/recommended-reading-jesus.html">Recommended Reading: Jesus and John Wayne by Kristin Kobes Du Mez</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/11/16/recommended-reading-jesus.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-11-16 09:42:00 -0500">Nov 16, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>How could the vast majority of white evangelicals support Donald Trump in 2016 and again in 2020? To understand it as Dr. Kristin Kolbes Du Mez tells it, there’s a clear, direct line to trace between the muscular revivalism of Billy Sunday, the virile energy of Billy Graham crusades, the Religious Right’s embrace of the American military in the 1980s, and the eventual election of the 45th president.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/eb52eef10e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2H7SiUc">Jesus and John Wayne</a></em>, Dr. Du Mez (a professor of history at Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan) details American evangelicalism’s attraction to the rugged manliness epitomized by the actor of classic westerns and the corresponding clearly delineated male and female gender roles. Whether manifest in Phyllis Schlafly’s fight against the ERA, the ascendancy of James Dobson’s Focus on the Family, the religious right’s embrace of Iran-Contra conspirator Oliver North, or the later “Biblical manhood” emphasis of John Eldridge and Mark Driscoll, a common emphasis on manly men and submissive women threaded through it all.</p>
<p>Dr. Du Mez traces through politics, theology, and also education. While men like Bill Gothard and Doug Phillips are less well known outside of conservative evangelical circles than, say, Jerry Falwell or Tim LaHaye, Du Mez makes a case for their estimable influence. This embrace of patriarchy then makes its way to popular TV like <em>Duck Dynasty</em> and the Duggar family’s <em>19 Kids and Counting</em>.</p>
<p>I grew up in evangelicalism. The picture Dr. Du Mez paints of the late 1980s and 1990s is very familiar to me. The details she fills in provided some “aha” moments, too. The devastating penultimate chapter details how so many of these champions of Christian manhood and patriarchal gender roles ended up in personal disgrace. Jimmy Swaggart. Jim Bakker. Ted Haggard. Paige Patterson. Mark Driscoll. C. J. Mahaney. Bill Gothard. Jack Hyles. Jack Schaap. Doug Phillips. Whether it’s fair or not, it seems almost impossible to avoid the conclusion that the message these men taught about manhood and gender was frequently cover for deep, unaddressed sin.</p>
<p>Where evangelicals go from here is an open question. Just this week pastor Andy Stanley said <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/andy-stanley-evangelicals-trump/617103/">in an interview with <em>The Atlantic</em></a> that the Trump era of evangelical history will all fade “into a bad dream” within “a year or two”. After reading <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2H7SiUc">Jesus and John Wayne</a></em>, I’m skeptical. The plant that sprouted Trump’s presidency has hundred-year-old roots. It’ll take more than a year or two of faded memories to banish it, if American evangelicals even take up the task. I’m thankful, though, for historians like Dr. Du Mez who at least tell the story.</p>

<p>Don’t buy into the lie that all social justice is driven by Marxist ideology. It is not! It is what the prophets commanded, what Jesus expects of his followers, what the church has accepted as normal, and what constitutional democracies with a Christian heritage should aspire to, not in spite of, but precisely because of their Christian heritage.

Let me be clear, love of neighbour requires you to be concerned for the just treatment of your neighbour, whether they are Black, Hispanic, First Peoples, LGBT, migrant, Muslim, working-class, or even Baptist. Any derogation of a Christian’s duty to be concerned about the welfare and just-treatment of their neighbour is an attack on the biblical love command itself.

			 <p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to express how big a deal today is for my household. Back in January we first floated the idea with an unmotivated daughter that switching from home school to public school might be a good step. She was very excited. In late February we went to an open house at the local high school and then in early March we got her registered for fall classes.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, COVID shut everything down and the spring and summer became a long slog. For months we&rsquo;ve been holding on to the lifeline of knowing that in late August school would start and we would get some structure back. The school district instituted a 50/50 virtual/in-person scheme that would have the kids at school at least a couple days a week. We bought school supplies and marked our calendars.</p>
<p>Then in mid-August, a week before school was set to start, <a href="/20/08/devastation/">the derecho hit</a>. We were 11 days without power. And almost every school building in the district was damaged. The girls' high school lost part of its roof and sustained significant water damage to the gym, auditorium, and much of the rest of the building. School got delayed by another month, and will be 100% virtual until January at the earliest.</p>
<p>But finally&hellip; today is the day. At 7:50 AM the first class hour started and our middle daughter was logged into Google Meet with 19 other tired-looking freshmen (freshpeople? first years?) to start her German class. (Our oldest daughter had first hour off but is now logged in for second hour.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long year, friends. Today is just one day, just a start, but it&rsquo;s a significant milestone. And there are better days to come.</p>
<p>(Oh, and it&rsquo;s September 21, so we started the morning with this song&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The other day <a href="/20/09/god-land-by-lyz-lenz-a-belated-review/">I posted a belated review and recommendation</a> of Lyz Lenz’s book <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/god-land-a-story-of-faith-loss-and-renewal-in-middle-america/9780253041531">God Land</a></em>. Today I’d like to tell the story of why this review was delayed a year.</p>
<p>Lyz is, as I am, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. We have some small personal connection. Her (now ex-)husband works for the same huge employer that I (and 8000 other people in town) do. We have some of the same friends. And for a short time a decade or so ago, we attended the same church. That last bit is what made this whole thing complicated.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>God Land</em> is about religion in the Midwest, liberally strewn with Lyz’s stories from her own life. In the first chapter of the book, she recounts bad experiences at a church where she and her husband were members. She wanted to discuss women’s roles within the church. She got brushed off by one pastor with a series of nebulous promises that it could be discussed later. Later, on a mission trip, another pastor refused to let her lead prayer during morning devotions, saying it wasn’t a woman’s place to do so. Eventually she and her husband left that church to join a church plant. (<em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/31/god-land-lyz-lenz-excerpt-journey-find-church">published a long excerpt from that chapter</a> if you want to read it.)</p>
<p>A year ago, when reading and reviewing the book, I was still a member of that church. Not only that, I was being paid to lead the music ministry. So when I published my review on Goodreads early on a Monday morning and it got auto-tweeted on my feed, before lunchtime I had a phone call from the new senior pastor telling me that, as a church “staff member” (the first time anyone had called me that!) I shouldn’t be recommending the book. It was gossip, he told me, and I shouldn’t be spreading it. I wasn’t ready to die on that hill that day, so I discussed it with him for a little while and then deleted the tweet. But it still really bugged me.</p>
<p>No one that I’ve talked to has disputed the broad strokes of Lyz’s stories about our church. She privately told me the same basic stories a few years before. In the book she changes the names of the pastors and doesn’t name the church, but if you’ve been in the Cedar Rapids evangelical church scene very long you can probably guess who they are. I’ve been told by others in the know that the events she described on the mission trip did indeed happen that way. And I’ve heard second hand from the other pastor that he didn’t remember his episode “quite that way”, but didn’t dispute the basic facts. (He did confirm Lyz&rsquo;s note that he has tried reach out again to her on several occasions, and that she hasn&rsquo;t responded.)</p>
<p>So if the accounts are basically true, why should their mention be suppressed? If someone hasn’t read the book or doesn’t know the people, they won’t be any the wiser. If someone has read the book and <em>does</em> know the people, trying to suppress the discussion only makes it look like the church has something to hide. Why can’t we just speak honestly about it? I count the pastors involved as friends, and I love the people of that church. I don’t want to hurt them. But suppressing truth, even painful truth, isn’t beneficial. Better to acknowledge and learn from mistakes than try to pretend they didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Back last year when the book came out I attended a reading &amp; signing that Lyz did at a local bookstore. During the Q&amp;A after the reading I mentioned that I, too, was trying to figure out if or when my route should lead me out of the evangelical churches where I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life. Later on that night when she signed my copy of the book, she wrote this message inside: &ldquo;To the Hubbs' — get freed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that implied level of joy from having left our last church. While I have significant disappointments, I don&rsquo;t feel any personal animus toward any of those church folks. I feel like we left on good terms. But I am glad to now feel free enough to tell this story. Truth will out. Sure, truth can be spoken in ways that are harmful. But speaking the truth peaceably, in love, is a necessity for the church to become the loving, safe community God intends for it to be. This bit of truth from me is overdue.</p>

			 <p>Rebecca West, from <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em>, describing her experience observing a worshipper at an Orthodox Easter service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One can shout at the top of one’s voice the information that the 11.15 for Brighton leaves from platform 6, but subtler news has to be whispered, for the reason that to drag knowledge of reality over the threshold of consciousness is an exhausting task, whether it is performed by art or by experience. She made no spectacular declaration that man is to be saved; simply her attitude assumed that this Easter would end with no more fatality than any other Easter she had known, and her body, wasted yet proud in its coarse and magnificent clothes, proclaimed that death may last five hundred years yet not be death.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/09/07/god-land-by.html">God Land by Lyz Lenz — A Belated Review</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/09/07/god-land-by.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-09-07 18:31:14 -0500">Sep 7, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It’s been a year since Lyz Lenz’s book <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/god-land-a-story-of-faith-loss-and-renewal-in-middle-america/9780253041531">God Land</a></em> came out. I wrote a review on Goodreads at the time but for various reasons didn’t publish it here. It’s overdue.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Lyz has published <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/belabored-a-vindication-of-the-rights-of-pregnant-women/9781541762831"><em>another</em> book</a>, which is still sitting unread on my shelf. (Soon.) She’s also joined the staff of <em>The Cedar Rapids Gazette</em> and has become a strong opinion voice there. I can’t wait to see what she writes next. But in the mean time, here’s my short review/recommendation of <em>God Land</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God Land is an insightful and challenging critique of Christianity in Middle America. Lyz Lenz clearly still loves her Midwestern home, but laments that the predominant Christian voices are conflating Republicanism, gun culture, and male-only leadership with the message of Jesus.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
God Land doesn&rsquo;t try to paint an overly cheery &ldquo;we just shouldn&rsquo;t let politics divide us&rdquo; picture. Lenz&rsquo;s own story illustrates how divisive these issues can be on a personal level. She doesn&rsquo;t pull punches as she recounts the end of her marriage, leaving one church, having a church plant die, and her struggles to find supportive community.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
God Land&rsquo;s clear affection for Middle America and portraits of small-town Americans combined with Lenz' beautiful prose and painfully honest diagnosis make it a must-read in 2019 America.</p>

			 <p>I guess I don&rsquo;t need to wait until the end of the year to do another summary&hellip; August suffered for reading much (thanks, derecho), but there&rsquo;s still been some good stuff to recommend over the last couple months. Here are the highlights:</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/3gSTEOj">Fault Lines: A History of the United States since 1974</a></em> by Kevin Kruse</strong><br>
A very readable recounting of the last 50 years of US history, showing how these &ldquo;fault lines&rdquo; formed that have resulted in the fractures we see today. Kruse is a great follow on Twitter, too. I&rsquo;m not sure I was really ready to read a &ldquo;history&rdquo; of so much that still feels very current, but it&rsquo;s good to have a book like this out there.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/31RBKY9">The Spirituality of the Cross</a></em> by Gene Edward Veith</strong><br>
This was recommended by a friend when I was looking for a good book on Lutheran theology. This is fairly short and high-level, but the chapter on vocation was worth the whole book all by itself. (The rest of the book was very good, too.)</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/31RrXBd">The Power</a></em></strong> <strong>by Naomi Alderman</strong><br>
What would happen if women suddenly developed a power that gave them a physical advantage over men? What would the world look like? Such is the tantalizing premise of <em>The Power</em>. It could&rsquo;ve been 100 pages longer and I wouldn&rsquo;t have complained.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32PNBoH">Into the Silent Land: A Guide to the Christian Practice of Contemplation</a></em></strong> <strong>by Martin Laird</strong><br>
A short introduction to the practice of contemplative prayer. Very practical in its discussion of techniques, but also delving into the spiritual purpose and background of contemplation. I&rsquo;m lousy at it, but it&rsquo;s something that I find beneficial when I set aside a little bit of time to just be still.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2QQ2yli">Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination</a></em> by Walter Wink</strong><br>
<a href="/20/08/walter-wink-on-nationalism-and-the-myth-of-redemptive-violence/">I wrote about this one a little bit already</a>. Just as relevant today as it was when it was written.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/32PNzNB">The Mystery of Christ &amp; Why We Don&rsquo;t Get It</a></em> by Robert Farrar Capon</strong><br>
Capon in his typical informal style here, pressing the point that he makes just as bluntly in his wonderful <em>Between Noon and Three</em>. &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; No condemnation. If that&rsquo;s really true&hellip; you are not condemned. You are forgiven. Grace is free. What are you now going to do with yourself? I love me some Capon.</p>
<p>There were others, but these were the highlights.</p>

			 <p>Suffice it to say I’m happy to have August 2020 in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>We have completed our house repairs after the derecho. Having a brother in construction sure makes that easier! Repaired the cracked rafter, rebuilt the broken dormer, reshingled the roof&hellip; Tree guy is working this week to take down the trees that won’t survive (which is most of them).</p>
<p>School in Cedar Rapids is starting three weeks late due to all the storm damage, and will then be 100% virtual rather than 50/50 in person. This change has probably been harder on the kids than the storm was. They are <em>so</em> ready to have a routine again and see people.</p>
<p>Wonder where we’ll be when October 1 gets here? In 2020 every month feels like a year. I wonder how long that’ll last.</p>

			 <p>It’s Sunday night. By tomorrow afternoon we’ll hit a week since the storm hit. No power yet. The power crew was relaxing a pole on a main line two blocks down this afternoon, so I’m hopeful maybe they’ll work their way down my street tomorrow. </p>
<p>Of course it’s also possible that they work the other direction, or work north before east, or any other number of things. I want to be unselfish and see my neighbors get power back and at the same point I’m <em>so</em> ready to get it back myself. </p>
<p>The noise of the generator is incessant. It’s a big one — 8000 watts — and it runs from when I start it in the morning at 7:30 until I turn it off around 10 in the evening. I’ve been thinking of it in some ways like a farmer’s work horse. Put it in the garage for the night, hope it rests well and feels good again tomorrow because I’m relying on it. So far so good.</p>
<p>Its noise is reminding me of running the Shop-Vacs in the basement during the flood of 2008. For one brutal night we had three vacs going to keep the water at bay. They had to be emptied every 30 minutes or so through the night. I sat upstairs with earphones on watching videos to try to stay awake, but I couldn’t get away from that wall of noise. The generator feels that way, too. Even inside the house with the windows shut, it’s there. Finally at night we shut it down and the quiet is so nice&hellip; but then of course there are no fans to cool us while we sleep. </p>
<p>We walked the neighborhood tonight and it looks like a war zone. Every house has trees down. Almost every house has either missing siding or a tarp on the roof or a fence down (or all three). Normalcy is years away, not months. </p>
<p>Tonight I’m sitting in a lawn chair out front of the house drinking a beer and watching the sun go down. It’s a little bit of partial peace at the end of a long week, disturbed only by that incessant noise of the generator.</p>

			 <p>It’s the Friday after the Iowa derecho. What a week. After the <a href="/20/08/devastation/">devastation</a> of the storm, the cleanup began. Monday night I had friends here to get the limbs on the ground and a tarp on the roof. Tuesday and Thursday they were back cutting up the trees that fell into our yard. By tonight all the trees are cut up and the limbs to the curb. All that remains is a backyard full of small branches and leaves which will be easily enough dealt with tomorrow.</p>
<p>The power company officially announced yesterday that power would be “substantially restored” to the county by next Tuesday. But the power company guy who was driving through our neighborhood last night informally told us to expect at least a week, maybe more. We have a tree on the line behind our house which affects at most about 6 homes. Fixing it is obviously a lower priority than fixing other downed lines that affect more people. It’s hard to argue with the logic but it’s a bummer to be at the end of the list. Thankfully we do have a generator which keeps lights, fans, and internet going.</p>
<p>The town is slowly reopening. The Chick-Fil-A our daughter works at reopened the drive through on Wednesday and is slowly expanding their open hours as they get staff available. Gas stations are now open enough that the lines have mostly gone away. Grocery stores are open. Schools are another story. School plans have moved from half-time attendance (thanks, COVID) to now potentially full-time virtual for the first few months of the school year. All the buildings in the district are damaged, and our girls’ high school is among the most badly damaged.</p>
<p>Now that the initial shock has worn off, the word that characterizes much of what I’m feeling is <em>fragile</em>.</p>
<p>The power to the house relies on a generator that needs to keep running. The fiber cable that brings internet to the house is suspended across the backyard by a few shepherd’s hooks. The roof over my daughter’s bedroom has a sizable chunk missing, with only some plywood and a tarp covering it. We have a cold front coming through tonight. The cooler temps will be welcome. The potential thunderstorms will not be.</p>
<p>The whole city infrastructure is fragile, so if anything else were to break or go wrong, it’s that much harder to get any help. It’s not like I need an electrician or a plumber every day, but it’s nice to know that I can generally get one if I have an emergency. This month? Not so much.</p>
<p>At this point in these kind of posts someone usually brings out an inspirational hashtag. I’ve seen #IowaStrong going around this week. (It’s been employed plenty of previous times, including the floods of 2008 and the floods again in 2016. I’ve seen the community rally, and I’ve had friends who’ve been great help. But I look around and see all the pain in my community, and tonight I’m having a hard time rallying. This just sucks, and will for a long time.</p>

			 <p>Where to even start? Monday, August 10, somewhere around 12:30 PM, eastern Iowa got hit with a storm like no one had ever seen before. Technically known as a “derecho”, this storm brought 100+ MPH straight line winds along with torrential rain. 45 minutes later Cedar Rapids was transformed into a disaster zone. No one had power. Everyone had trees down, most of them on houses or cars, on power lines and across streets. As if 2020 wasn’t bad enough already&hellip;</p>
<p>I was working from home when the storm hit. Bouncing between the basement for safety and the upstairs so we could see what was going on, we were horrified at the storm, and then we started hearing things crashing. Then the house shuddered as a limb landed on it. When things cleared and we could go outside, we found a complete mess. Our huge locust tree in the front yard split down the middle, with the near side falling between the house and driveway. (The car in the driveway was spared, hallelujah.) The neighbor’s oak tree snapped in two and half of it lay across our front yard. The shared oak tree on our property line only dropped one limb, but it fell across the corner of the house, damaging the roof and some plaster inside.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the backyard we lost a big limb from other other locust tree, lost most of our apple tree, and have the top half of the neighbor’s pine tree laying on our chain link fence. (And also on the power line.)</p>
<p>We’ve spent the last two days cleaning up branches and debris, scrounging the region for gas for the generator, and making temporary repairs. Nearly everyone in this city of 150,000 people has similar and worse damage. It’ll be months and years to get things repaired. It’ll be days if not weeks just to get power back on.</p>
<p>Tonight we’re trying to coax the cooler outside air into the house after it got to 85F outside today (81F in the house), listening to the generator hum, and catching up with the outside world. Blessedly, our internet line stayed up and we still have service from our ISP. Tomorrow morning a friend is coming with chainsaws at 8 AM and we’ll keep cleaning up. One day at a time is about all I can handle thinking about right now, anyway.</p>

			 <p><em>Note: I originally wrote this post in January 2019. 18 months later we made the decision to leave this church. It feels like now it&rsquo;s time to let this post see the light of day.</em></p>
<p>We were ten years at our first church out of college.</p>
<p>After those ten years we recognized that we had poured ourselves into the church to the point of exhaustion. I was leading the worship ministry; my wife was leading behind the scenes doing meals, funerals, kitchen stuff - the practical glue that holds a small church together. We had two kids and a third on the way. I had a full-time job outside of the church. It was just too much.</p>
<p>We went around and around trying to figure out how to lighten the ministry load without throwing it off altogether. When I tried to shed tasks my pastor would tell me that he sympathized, but that the church just <em>needed me</em>, that I was almost indispensable, and that they would be in a bad place if I quit.</p>
<p>We watched our handful of real friends at church move out of town or to other churches. When we finally decided the only way to get out was to, well, <em>get out</em>, I found that the pastor who I thought was my friend really cared more about the ministry than about me. The day he called to ask how it was going and I told him that I was leaving the church, he said he wanted to sit down and talk about it&hellip; but he didn&rsquo;t have time in his schedule until two weeks later. Maybe he was just cutting his losses.</p>
<p>We landed at another church, a bigger one this time, where it&rsquo;d be harder for us to become indispensable. Our new church had a full-time worship pastor. He listened to my tale of burnout and was protective of my schedule. We developed what felt like a friendship - at least, we&rsquo;d meet for lunches semi-regularly where we talked about life and ministry for 2 - 3 hours at a go. (Is that what passes for friendship when you&rsquo;re an adult?)</p>
<p>18 months ago the creative and philosophical differences between the worship pastor and me got great enough that, no matter how much we discussed them, I just couldn&rsquo;t stay on board. So, I documented my issues, sent my regrets, and bowed out as gracefully as I knew how. And once again, a pastor who I thought was my friend cut his losses, told me we should do lunch sometime, and then never talked to me again. <em>(Note: six months after originally writing this, that pastor</em> did <em>get in touch and we met for an hour so he could get clarification on some things I said. It was a weird and awkward meeting. We haven&rsquo;t talked again.)</em></p>
<p>Three months after I left the worship ministry, that worship pastor left our church to serve in another ministry and I got asked to be the interim worship ministry leader. I&rsquo;ve been doing that a year now, with probably at least another year to go before we get someone back on staff to lead it up. Nobody&rsquo;s yet told me that I&rsquo;m indispensable, but if I were to bail, the next guy in line who&rsquo;d pick up the slack would end up just that much closer to burning out, too.</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve been ten years now at our current church.</strong></p>
<p>It feels like a familiar path. My wife is back to organizing the kitchen, doing luncheons for funerals, quietly helping hold things together. I&rsquo;m leading the worship ministry. One by one the handful of people we counted as friends have moved out of town or to other churches. And I&rsquo;m sensing the exhaustion start to creep back in.</p>
<p>At this point I start to wonder - <em>what am I doing wrong?</em> Or, more painfully, <em>what&rsquo;s wrong with me?</em> Is this just some sort of built-in ten year cycle, and it&rsquo;s time to go find a different church? Does that mean that ten years from now I&rsquo;ll be 50, an empty nester, and starting to look for yet <em>another</em> church? I don&rsquo;t think I really want that.</p>
<p>But then what&rsquo;s the lesson? Never befriend pastors? Never agree to lead a ministry? Follow your friends to their new churches? Resign myself to the idea of serving because I can and assuming that this sort of lonely weariness is just what God has for me?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard decision to even start considering, with kids involved in student ministries and investment in the current people and church efforts and the difficulty of finding and fitting in someplace else. But how much longer should we wait? It&rsquo;s been ten years.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/08/01/walter-wink-on.html">Walter Wink on nationalism and the myth of redemptive violence</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Walter Wink, writing in 1992 in <em><a href="https://amzn.to/30lMsp8">Engaging the Powers</a></em>, with paragraphs just as relevant today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The myth of redemptive violence thus uses the traditions, rites, customs, and symbols of Christianity in order to enhance the power of a wealthy elite and the goals of the nation narrowly defined. It has no interest in compassion for the poor, or for more equitable economic arrangements, or for the love of enemies. It merely uses the shell of religion — a shell that can be filled with the blasphemous doctrine of the national security state. Emptied of their prophetic vitality, these outer forms are then manipulated to legitimate a power system intent on the preservation of privilege at all costs.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Why then do large masses of the non privileged submit to such a myth? Why, for example, do blue-collar workers, who are among the most victimized by the ruling elite, continue not only to support their oppressors but to be among their most vociferous fans? The answer is quite simple: the promise of salvation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then a little further down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The myth of redemptive violence is nationalism become absolute. This myth speaks <em>for</em> God; it does not listen for God to speak. It invokes the sovereignty of God as its own; it does not entertain the prophetic possibility of radical denunciation and negation by God. It misappropriates the language, symbols, and scriptures of Christianity. It does not seek God in order to change; it claims God in order to prevent change. Its God is not the impartial ruler of all nations but a biased and partial tribal god worshiped as an idol. Its metaphor is not the journey but a fortress. Its symbol is not the cross but a rod of iron. It’s offer is not forgiveness but victory. Its good news is not the unconditional love of enemies but their final liquidation. Its salvation is not a new heart but a successful foreign policy. It usurps the revelation of God’s purposes for humanity in Jesus. It is blasphemous. It is idolatrous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only chapter one. I have a feeling there are more quotes to come.</p>

			 <p>One of the challenges a significant reading habit provides is where to keep all your books. While nearly all my fiction and a portion of my non-fiction comes from (and goes back to) the public library, when it comes to theology I still end up buying a fair number of books. And since book sales are no respecter of reading plans, my book inventory grows regularly as book inventories are wont to do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the past several years my to-read pile has grown next to my bed. It started on the shelf under my bedside stand, then became two piles on that shelf, then added a pile in front of the bedside stand, and then a second pile next to that one. This approach became not just a tripping hazard but also a purchasing hazard (I have bought at least a couple duplicates) and a reading hazard, since it’s very easy to forget what you have available to read when it’s buried in a pile.</p>
<p>This weekend provided time to finally do something about it. Becky helped turn my initial concept into something actually workable for our bedroom, and this afternoon I was able to put up two shelves and populate them with books.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A row of hooks under the lower shelf provide convenient spots for a robe and pajamas, and with the books right in my line of sight every day I will have regular opportunities to be reminded of books I own and want to read. (And to be reminded of how many unread books I have and that I should really think twice before buying another book.)</p>
<p>The shelves are simple from a design standpoint. Shelf brackets from Home Depot purportedly hold 150+ lbs per pair. They are well anchored into the wall - one side directly into the studs, the other side using heavy-duty drywall anchors into a double layer of drywall. As an engineer I’m fairly certain I over-designed them and they’ll hold up just fine; as a <em>cautious</em> engineer I’ll still be mildly nervous for a week or two until I get comfortable that they are, indeed, holding up.</p>
<p>Now I have some reading to do.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know I have <em>Infinite Jest</em> on the shelf. And that it&rsquo;s a book everybody buys and nobody actually reads. I read about 50 pages of it once. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get back to it. It&rsquo;s a sunk cost at this point.)</p>

			 <p>America’s Independence Day seems a strange holiday to “celebrate” this year. Our country is in turmoil with racial protests in cities both large and small. Our government’s mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic has left our country first meriting the world’s scorn and eventually its pity. Our people are so polarized that even wearing a mask is viewed as a political statement.</p>
<p>Yesterday President Trump gave a speech in front of Mount Rushmore, a site where white Americans literally engraved their political heroes on top of the sacred hills of the Native Americans they displaced. In his speech he declared that this summer’s protestors - a group that includes me - are a “dangerous movement”, a “radical assault”, “far-left fascism”, a “left-wing cultural revolution designed to overthrow the American Revolution”, resulting in “the very definition of totalitarianism”.</p>
<p>Me? I’d just like to see some responsible leadership. I’d like to not have black people get killed by police at ridiculous rates. I‘d like to have more white people like me start coming to grips with how recent (and current) our racist systems were and still are. And I’d like us to start changing those systems.</p>
<p>My Christian faith should be common ground even with those who see politics very differently. Yet this year there are so many, especially among the white evangelical group, who don’t even seem to share a common reality. Inconvenient facts are “fake news”. Any wrong that the President does is either overblown by the media or justifiable. (The ends are what are important, right?)</p>
<p>How can you sit quietly to maintain the perception of unity in the fellowship when it requires you to not talk about applying your faith to current events?</p>
<p>That thing where Jesus said he would set brother against brother seems a lot more real when your brother is so frustrated with your application of faith to your politics that he isn’t talking to you. But then I wonder whether he’s quoting the same verse thinking about me. And I wonder how we ever get past it.</p>
<p>There is no city fireworks display this year and I’m finding no joy in the neighbors’ best attempts to make up for it. Not so many Independence Days ago I would drag the kids out into the oppressive humidity and battle mosquitos just so we could enjoy the fireworks with oohs and awe. Tonight the explosions just bring acrid smoke and unwelcome noise late into the tired night.</p>
<p>What will next year’s celebration look like? What will we be celebrating? Will we be any less tired? Any more hopeful?</p>
<p><em>Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace. I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.</em></p>

			 <p>July 1st means that we&rsquo;re halfway through 2020 already&hellip; what a year. I looked back and realized I haven&rsquo;t posted any reading compendiums yet this year. And to be honest, the reading has been a little slow. You&rsquo;d think a work-from-home pandemic would mean more time for reading, but in reality it&rsquo;s turned out to leave fewer brain cycles for processing books. But I <em>have</em> done some reading. Rather than list everything I&rsquo;ve read (which <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=2020-reads">you can see on Goodreads</a> if you really want to), I&rsquo;ll just list some highlights.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2BUGYb6"><strong><em>This is How You Lose the Time War</em></strong> by Amal El-Mohtar</a><br>
An inventive short sci-fi novel from the voices of two competing people engaged in some sort of, well, time war. Hard to describe, but it was short and easy to read and I enjoyed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2ZG2hWb"><strong><em>The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir</em></strong> by Samantha Power</a><br>
I loved this book so much. Power is a fascinating woman. Born in Ireland, came to America as a child, became a journalist and human rights advocate more or less on her own in her 20s, latched on to the Obama campaign in 2008 as an adviser on human rights issues and ended up serving as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. Really well written and engaging read. If Joe Biden gets elected this fall, Power seems like a great candidate to be Secretary of State in his administration.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3dPVzSf"><strong><em>With Head and Heart: The Autobiography of Howard Thurman</em></strong> by Howard Thurman</a><br>
A fascinating memoir of a black man from the South who ended up as a progressive pastor in San Francisco.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2BhZ0Eh"><strong><em>Dominion: How the Christian Revolution Remade the World</em></strong> by Tom Holland</a><br>
Holland makes the case that Christianity has remade the world over the past two millennia - that most of what we consider western human values today - care for human rights, the dignity of all people, regard for the poor, etc - were not considered virtues before Christianity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got several books in progress at the moment which should provide some more good recommendations&hellip; I&rsquo;ll keep you all posted.</p>

<p>Theodosia writes me a letter every day<br>
I&rsquo;m keeping her bed warm while her husband is away<br>
He&rsquo;s on the British side in Georgia<br>
He&rsquo;s trying to keep the colonies in line<br>
But he can keep all of Georgia<br>
Theodosia, she&rsquo;s mine</p>
<p>Love doesn&rsquo;t discriminate<br>
Between the sinners<br>
And the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
And we keep loving anyway<br>
We laugh and we cry<br>
And we break<br>
And we make our mistakes<br>
And if there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m by her side<br>
When so many have tried<br>
Then I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it<br>
I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it</p>
<p>My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher<br>
But there are things that the<br>
Homilies and hymns won&rsquo;t teach ya<br>
My mother was a genius<br>
My father commanded respect<br>
When they died they left no instructions<br>
Just a legacy to protect</p>
<p>Death doesn&rsquo;t discriminate<br>
Between the sinners and the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
And we keep living anyway<br>
We rise and we fall<br>
And we break<br>
And we make our mistakes<br>
And if there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m still alive<br>
When everyone who loves me has died<br>
I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it<br>
I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it</p>
<p>I am the one thing in life I can control<br>
I am inimitable<br>
I am an original<br>
I&rsquo;m not falling behind or running late<br>
I&rsquo;m not standing still<br>
I am lying in wait</p>
<p>Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb<br>
He has something to prove<br>
He has nothing to lose<br>
Hamilton&rsquo;s pace is relentless<br>
He wastes no time<br>
What is it like in his shoes?</p>
<p>Hamilton doesn&rsquo;t hesitate<br>
He exhibits no restraint<br>
He takes and he takes and he takes<br>
And he keeps winning anyway<br>
He changes the game<br>
He plays and he raises the stakes<br>
And if there&rsquo;s a reason<br>
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit</p>

I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it&hellip;</p>
<p>Life doesn&rsquo;t discriminate<br>
Between the sinners and the saints<br>
It takes and it takes and it takes<br>
And we keep living anyway<br>

			 <p>Culling my list down to 10 albums was a challenge. Here are a few also-rans that just didn&rsquo;t quite make the cut:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Morning</em> - Andrew Osenga</strong><br>
This one got a <em>lot</em> of play time from me, and I spent a lot of time playing its songs. Andy O&rsquo;s solo stuff continues to be meaningful to me, but this one hit the sweet spot where our life experiences aligned and I felt like he was writing about the things that I&rsquo;d write about if only I had any skill at writing songs.</p>
<p><strong><em>In Rainbows</em> - Radiohead</strong><br>
Radiohead is another band I came to mid-stream. <em>In Rainbows</em> is not usually listed as anybody&rsquo;s favorite Radiohead album, but it was the gateway for me into their music. I dig it.</p>
<p><strong><em>All That You Can&rsquo;t Leave Behind</em> - U2</strong><br>
Same story - this was the gateway for me into U2&rsquo;s music. Such a good record.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Soundtrack</em> - Lin-Manuel Miranda and cast</strong><br>
All that stuff I said about my love for smart wordplay? <em>Hamilton</em> has that in spades. More than any other record I can think of. My love for <em>Hamilton</em> knows no bounds.</p>

			 <p>I’m playing keys for the church livestream this morning, which in the end results in me having a bunch of time to mess around with a keyboard between rehearsal and the stream itself. Put a few of us musicians together and you never know what you’re gonna get.</p>
<p>So here’s the musical idea I came up with this morning: Kermit the Frog, singing Rainbow Connection&hellip; in a jazz style, <em>a la</em> Ella Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>Funny part is, it kinda worked. I was gonna try to do a chorus scatting but my good sense got the better of me. Our sound guy apparently has it all recorded, though&hellip; one of these days he’s gonna do a blooper reel and it’s gonna be hilarious and awesome and scary all at the same time.</p>

<li>Since I started working from home 8 weeks ago, my morning routine has changed. No more gym, reading and writing in the morning instead.</li>
<li>Also, Wordpress is impressed with my 10-day posting streak. It’s easy to write about music. But a lazy bullet points post will get me to 11.</li>
<li>(Insert Spinal Tap reference here.)</li>
<li>Saturday mornings have become cinnamon roll mornings. It’s not helping my waistline but it’s a nice way to celebrate the weekend.</li>
<li>The siding guys are done with our house. It looks great and I’m enthused that I will not need to paint the outside of the house again.</li>
<li>I’m thankful that we have local coffee roasters still doing their thing because Walmart-brand coffee isn’t the greatest.</li>
<li>I’m kinda gonna miss the siding guys, though, since the noise and bustle of them working made it not feel so creepily quiet every day.</li>
<li>I bought a <a href="https://www.bibliotheca.co/">Bibliotheca</a> Bible boxed set when they did the kickstarter several years ago. It seemed like a cool idea but I ended up not being a fan of the translation they used and they quickly just started collecting dust on my shelf.</li>
<li>This week somebody on Facebook wanted to buy them. They are like new other than the New Testament volume which has some minor notes I put in the first 5 chapters of Matthew. Oddly enough that person preferred to buy an incomplete set rather than buy a NT volume with a few notes in it.</li>
<li>Going to the post office to mail these books will be the first time I’ve gone anywhere all week.</li>
<li>These bullet points aren’t as random as they should be. It feels like a lazy way to do a partial narrative without any through line. What the heck, it’s 2020, we all deserve some slack.</li>

<p>Maybe this one should&rsquo;ve been first on my list, but I decided to leave the best for last. Rich Mullins was a formative artist - perhaps <em>the</em> formative artist - of my musical life. I spent more time learning his piano licks (well, Reed Arvin&rsquo;s piano licks) and sitting at the piano singing his songs than any other songwriter. <em>Liturgy, Legacy</em> wasn&rsquo;t my first Mullins album, but it is the best.</p>
<p>Structured in two halves, the A-side (Liturgy) half of <em>Liturgy, Legacy</em> captures all the best of Rich Mullins. His tender vulnerability with his audience (Here In America), his keen awareness of nature&rsquo;s declaration of the glory of God (The Color Green), his raw and honest heart wrestling with brokenness (Hold Me Jesus), his firm confidence in the faith (Creed), his struggles in relationship to other saints (Peace)&hellip; and that&rsquo;s just the first half of the album.</p>
<p>Then comes the Legacy side, where Rich plays his hammered dulcimer for an instrumental and then explores the challenges of living life in the real world (Hard), wrestles with the challenges of coming from a real family and carrying their legacy (I&rsquo;ll Carry On), shares the joy of Christmas (You Gotta Get Up), laments the corrupt systems of society (How to Grow Up Big and Strong) and explores the tension of both loving the country you&rsquo;re born into while yearning for a better kingdom (Land of My Sojourn).</p>
<p>Every song on the record is a gem. And the fact that I just wrote those last two paragraphs directly from my memory of the album tells me something about how ingrained it is in my head and heart.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEkLONA7yAE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The other formative piece about Rich Mullins and this album is that Rich was the formative artist for many of the other artists I have included on this list. He was a mentor for Caedmon&rsquo;s Call. He was the inspiration for Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s songwriting. If you look behind the scenes at the artists who made Peterson&rsquo;s <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em> record, each of them will point to Rich as the one who charted the course they are following. Then there&rsquo;s also that weird bit where a guy from Rich&rsquo;s band also wrote some of the songs for <em>That Thing You Do!</em>, but that&rsquo;s a different story&hellip;</p>
<p>For the 20th anniversary of this record, Andrew Peterson and friends put on a tribute concert at The Ryman in Nashville where they played a bunch of Rich&rsquo;s other songs up front and then played this album through front to back for the second half of the show. It is, hands down, <a href="/17/09/andrew-peterson-and-friends-the-ragamuffin-album-live-at-the-ryman/">the best concert I&rsquo;ve ever attended</a>. Amazingly almost none of it seems to have made it to YouTube, but here&rsquo;s a taste.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMAPdwGoQPc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I could go on and on and on but I&rsquo;ll stop here. Suffice it to say that if you want to really get to the heart of the music that has formed me and shaped my musical soul, go listen to Rich Mullins. Peace.</p>

<p>I’ve really been wrestling with what album to post for day #9. But I’m gonna go with one that chronologically belongs back near the beginning of this series somewhere: Rachmaninov’s <em>Vespers (All Night Vigil)</em>. An <em>a capella</em> choral composition of settings from the Russian Orthodox’s All-night vigil service, it was reportedly one of Rachmaninov’s favorites of his own works and is a peaceful, stately work of surpassing beauty.</p>
<p>My first encounter with <em>Vespers</em> feels in retrospect like a very “Chris” story. I was probably 12. I was listening to NPR on the radio. (Yes, at 12.) Toward the end of some radio program (probably Fresh Air, but who knows), a music critic was comparing various new recordings of <em>Vespers</em>, pointing out how the Robert Shaw Chorale was perhaps more technically polished, but how the Russian choir recording was more vibrant. What I knew was that it was gorgeous music that I didn’t want to forget.</p>
<p>It was probably a year or two before I bought the CD at a music store. If I recall correctly, this first recording I purchased was by the USSR Ministry of Culture Choir. It was wonderful. I’ve since purchased a couple more versions on CD, and now in today’s world of streaming music I have an overwhelming number of recordings to choose from.</p>
<p>Regardless of which version you listen to, the beauty of the composition shines through, and a read through the translation of the Russian texts reminds you that classical church music isn’t limited to Bach and Handel and their western ilk. This is truly wonderful stuff, and shaped my musical inclinations from a young age. Worth a listen.</p>

<p><em>I got tagged on Facebook to do this project – share ten albums that greatly influenced my taste in music. One album per day for ten consecutive days. In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>Now we come to Bruce Hornsby. I&rsquo;m not sure whether to classify this record as influential because it shaped me, or influential in that I came to it and felt an instant musical kinship. Either way, wow, this record.</p>
<p>Somehow I had gotten a decade into my adulthood without being familiar with Bruce Hornsby&rsquo;s music. I unwittingly knew one of his hits because Rush Limbaugh used it as bumper music (back in the dark ages when I listened to Limbaugh), but that was it. But then one day I found this album - I think as a discounted digital download from Amazon - and I was hooked.</p>
<p>Hornsby is an amazing technical pianist - I <em>wish</em> I had fingers like that - but has made his career basically leading rock jam bands. <em>Bride of the Noisemakers</em> is a double-length live album containing the best of Bruce along with his band (the Noisemakers). They repeatedly take what would be 4-minute songs on a studio album and turn them into 10-minute jam sessions, trading back and forth between piano, guitar, bass, drums, and saxophone.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eA7idF1RGls' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I resonate strongly with this record because, if it doesn&rsquo;t sound too obnoxious, Hornsby&rsquo;s playing style and harmonies feel a lot like my own. One could listen to me improvise and think that I had learned from Hornsby even though I had never really listened to his stuff. I&rsquo;m not sure where that came from, but I&rsquo;m happy for it.</p>
<p>A couple years ago my wife and I had the opportunity to hear Hornsby live here in town. It was a solo show - just him and the piano - but a fantastic couple of hours not just enjoying the songs but also getting my head around how his brain processes stuff as a musician. (I <a href="/18/11/a-night-with-bruce-hornsbys-brain/">wrote up some thoughts the next day</a>.)</p>
<p>In general I prefer live music performances to studio recordings, and even better if I can <em>see</em> the band and enjoy their interaction as artists creating music. As such, this live Bruce Hornsby record is a no-brainer for my list.</p>

In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>Once again, another band that I jumped in to mid-stream and then backfilled. I don&rsquo;t remember how Arcade Fire jumped onto my radar, but once I started listening to <em>The Suburbs</em> it was a long time before I stopped. It became my running soundtrack the year I trained for (and ran) a half marathon, and those repeated listens let it soak deeply into my brain.</p>
<p>Win Butler, lead singer and key songwriter for Arcade Fire, grew up Mormon in Texas before moving to Montreal, Canada as an adult. Maybe I&rsquo;m reading too much into his upbringing, but when I listen to his songs I hear a kindred spirit wrestling with a fundamentalist upbringing, a disenchantment with the brokenness of the world, and a desire for something <em>more</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Suburbs</em> was a record that seemed to grow out of nowhere to then get substantial recognition. It won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year for 2010, but even as the host announced the award, they seemed unsure of whether the band name was &ldquo;Arcade Fire&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Suburbs&rdquo;. But wow, it landed for me.</p>

<p>I still kick myself a bit that I passed up an opportunity to stand in line and see Arcade Fire play in a little bitty discotheque in Montreal when I was up there for work several years ago. I did see them finally in an arena show on the <em>Reflektor</em> tour, and they were fantastic live.</p>
<p>Once I got hooked on Arcade Fire, I went back and got familiar with the rest of their discography and gained a deep appreciation for those, too. While my favorite AF song and favorite AF lyric may neither show up on <em>The Suburbs</em>, it remains my favorite front-to-back album of theirs, and deserves a spot on my 10 albums list.</p>

			 <p>In these turbulent days the news can quickly become overwhelming, and the social media noise can quickly drown out the worthwhile signal. One bit of regular news writing I&rsquo;ve found very helpful, though is a daily email newsletter from historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Cox_Richardson">Heather Cox Richardson</a>. Dr. Richardson has a Ph.D. from Harvard and is currently a professor of history at Boston College.</p>
<p>Dr. Richardson&rsquo;s email newsletter, titled <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">&ldquo;Letters from an American&rdquo;</a>, comes out nightly and usually summarizes the day&rsquo;s key events. She provides an historian&rsquo;s perspective on what she believes is long-term important out of the day&rsquo;s news rather than what just made the most noise. I particularly appreciate that she provides sources for her story at the bottom of every post. Some days she&rsquo;ll take a longer view and help set this day&rsquo;s events in context. In that vein I&rsquo;d particularly recommend <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/may-3-2020">her May 3 post</a> tracing the history of the 20th century American rhetoric of patriotic individualism.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for some daily summary reading, I&rsquo;d recommend giving Letters from an American a try. It&rsquo;s a free newsletter, and easy to sign up!</p>

<p><em>I got tagged on Facebook to do this project – share ten albums that greatly influenced my taste in music. One album per day for ten consecutive days. In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>I started writing today’s post thinking I was going to write about a classic jazz album. One that everybody would recognize, and that is a favorite of mine for the same reason it’s a favorite of many, many people. But then I got to thinking - was it really formative for me? Probably not. And then this album sprang to mind and insisted that it be added to the list. Bear with me.</p>
<p><em>And now it’s time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song. So, without further ado, Silly Songs with Larry.</em></p>
<p>Veggie Tales were just becoming a thing in my late high school years, and I didn’t have any familiarity with them until I hit college. Then one night I was with a church group at someone’s home and they had a Veggie Tales video on for the kids and I heard a (non-silly-song) rhyme that stopped me in my tracks. The king’s advisers are trying to figure out how to get rid of Daniel, and they include these lines:</p>
<p><em>We could use him as a footstool or a table to play Scrabble on<br>
Then tie him up and beat him up and throw him out of Babylon</em></p>
<p>Wait, what’s that? Somebody with the nerve to rhyme “Scrabble on” with “Babylon” without blatantly winking at the camera while doing so? <em>This</em> is someone I needed to pay more attention to. So then I bought the Silly Songs with Larry CD, and it was all downhill from there.</p>
<p>This CD got dozens of plays at our house before we had kids old enough to listen to it. Heck, before we even had kids. I am a sucker for wordplay. This love would take me later to Weird Al Yankovic, and then to quickly embrace Lin-Manuel Miranda’s <em>Hamilton</em>. But before that was Phil Vischer and his silly songs.</p>
<p>Over the years the phrases have become engrained in our family’s vocabulary. “Oh where is my hairbrush?” “Where’s my water buffalo? Why don’t <em>I</em> have a water buffalo? Are you prepared to deal with that? <em>I don’t think so!”</em> “Now the moral of the story, (it’s the point we hope we’ve made): if you go a little loopy, better keep your nurse well paid.” I led a sing-along of The Cheeseburger Song at the end of a church hymn sing one time. It was awesome.</p>
<p>I am overly proud of the fact that my children now display the same predilection to altering lyrics to songs. My oldest once sang original funny lyrics to Rewrite The Stars from <em>The Greatest Showman</em> at a karaoke night. (All my kids sang Weird Al at karaoke night.) I am always quick to make up a funny lyric when I can. And one of these days I’m gonna memorize all the Spanish so I can sing Larry’s part in Dance of the Cucumber.</p>

<p><em>I got tagged on Facebook to do this project – share ten albums that greatly influenced my taste in music. One album per day for ten consecutive days. In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday I left off by saying that my Caedmon’s Call fandom led me to Andrew Osenga, who in turn led me to Andrew Peterson. Today it’s time to tell a little more of that story.</p>
<p>Andrew Osenga wasn’t an original member of Caedmon’s Call. He had a band called The Normals which opened for Caedmon’s on occasion. At some point after The Normals stopped making records, Andy was invited to join Caedmon’s. Once I became familiar with Andy as a member of Caedmon’s, I quickly picked up his two available solo CDs - an EP called <em>Souvenirs and Postcards</em>, and a full-length CD called <em>Photographs</em>. They quickly became favorites.</p>
<p>In late 2005 I caught wind (maybe on the Caedmon’s fan forum?) that Andy Osenga was coming to Iowa to play a show with Andrew Peterson at a little start-up Christian music festival on the side of a hill in Clermont, Iowa. So, my wife and I bundled up our one-year-old daughter and drove the 90 minutes up to hear them (along with Ben Shive) play a two-hour concert from a flatbed trailer on the side of the hill. It was, in retrospect, a really weird gig for them. As Peterson said at the time, <a href="/05/10/the-first-time-ive-ever-played-a-concert-with-somebody-riding-a-cow-in-the-background/">“it’s the first time I’ve ever played a concert with somebody riding a cow in the background”</a>. No joke. I was thrilled to meet them that day and a little extra happy when AO said he recognized me from the fan forum. (Did I mention I was a big fanboy?)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Andy Osenga on the left, me on the right. October 2005. We both still had hair.</em></p>
<p>But I’m telling a lot of stories and not getting to my album for today. Anyway, at that show I ran into a co-worker who was there to see Andrew Peterson play, and we visited a bit. Fast-forward a year or so and that co-worker emailed me. She was bringing Andrew Peterson and friends to town to play a concert. Would I be interested in helping out with it for the day? Well, that was a no-brainer. And that gave me my first opportunity to hear the Christmas record and tour that would become a tradition: Andrew Peterson’s <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em>.</p>
<p>What can I even say about this record? It’s a concept album that tells the story of Jesus from both the Old Testament and the New, with creative songwriting, smart lyrics, beautiful melodies, amazing musicianship, and a sense of humor. Every year for 20 years now Andrew Peterson and his friends have taken this record on the road for a series of concerts between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I think I’ve been 5 times? But nothing will compare to that first time I saw it in a high school auditorium in Cedar Rapids. I’d never heard the record before I hear them play it live that night.</p>
<p>This record is influential to me not just for the brilliant songs, but also because of how it represents Peterson’s commitment to artistic community. He toured with the same musicians for almost all of those 20 years. They were not just co-workers but friends. Peterson would later expand the vision of that community into <a href="https://www.rabbitroom.com">The Rabbit Room</a>. But none of that would’ve happened without him nurturing those relationships on tours built around this one amazing album.</p>

<p><em>I got tagged on Facebook to do this project – share ten albums that greatly influenced my taste in music. One album per day for ten consecutive days. In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>One pattern that shows up in this list is my propensity to discover an artist not at their first album and then work forward, but to discover a later album and then work my way back through their discography. As I did with Michael W. Smith in my teens, and as I would in my 30s with Arcade Fire, U2, and Radiohead, in my late 20s I did with a little band called Caedmon’s Call.</p>
<p>I know my brother had a copy of their self-titled album back when I was in college, and I’m sure I listened to it a time or two but it just didn’t click for me. In retrospect, this really irks me because Caedmon’s was playing great shows and doing fan community events in the Houston area when I was in college in East Texas&hellip; road trips would not have been out of the question. But I digress.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2000 and I’m a young guy wandering the Christian book store (remember when those existed?) listening to demo CDs (or those?). On a whim I gave this CD a spin, and the acoustic guitar loop and B3 organ kicking off the title track sucked me in. And then there were little trumpet accents the second time through the intro riff, and I was completely hooked. (I would find out later that long-time Caedmon’s fans <em>hated</em> those trumpets, but what did I know? And again I digress.)</p>
<p><em>Long Line of Leavers</em> sucked me in and never let me go. I don’t know that it’s Caedmon’s best record - but it’s also hard to classify <em>best</em>. Their self-titled record and follow-up <em>40 Acres</em> have their classic acoustic sound, with some twisty Derek Webb lyrics thrown in for good measure. Later on, <em>Share The Well</em> (a concept album written and partially recorded in India) would bring a new level of maturity to their songwriting and production and set that record apart. But <em>Long Line of Leavers</em> was my gateway drug.</p>
<p>Finding this record and this band had more long-term impact on my life than probably any other record I’ll have on this list, save maybe for the one I’ll close with. Because after finding Caedmon’s and doing some internet searches to find out more about them, I stumbled upon a discussion forum run by and for Caedmon’s fans. I lurked there for a while. In 2004 I joined, picked an unintentionally hilarious username, and started posting. The other forum stalwarts became my friends. Through the years I have met many of them in person and deepened those friendships in meaningful ways. Their friends have become my friends. 16 years later they form a community I still interact with every day.</p>

<p>As a musician, I joke now that I learned everything I know about playing a B3 organ from listening to Caedmon’s Call. (There might in reality be a little bit of gospel music influence in there, too, but it’s mostly Caedmon’s.) Then Caedmon’s picked up a new guitar player named Andrew Osenga and I became a massive fanboy of his stuff for several years. And then Caedmon’s community pointed me to Andrew Peterson&hellip; but I’ll leave that story for tomorrow.</p>

In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation… but I want to explain! So I’m going to blog the explanations here.</em></p>
<p>So far I’ve shared my entry into <a href="/20/04/10-albums-10-days-rach-2/">classical</a> and then my entry into <a href="/20/04/10-albums-10-days-go-west-young-man/">Christian pop</a> music. Now it’s time to get to my other musical love: jazz. I don’t remember which friend introduced me to this record, but it take me long to get hooked. I wouldn’t see <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, the movie, for another decade, but this soundtrack hit my sweet spot. Full of jazz standards (It Had to be You, Don’t Get Around Much Any More, Stompin’ At the Savoy, Where or When), arranged by a 22-year-old up and coming jazz pianist named Harry Connick, Jr., with a rollicking stride piano version of Winter Wonderland in the middle&hellip; could you design an album more perfectly to appeal to teenaged me?</p>
<p>This is one of the records I know every note of. Each hit of each arrangement, every bend in the sax solo on It Had To Be You, and every one of Connick’s New Orleans-inspired alterations to Let’s Call The Whole Thing Off (“I say urster, you say oyster&hellip; I’m not gonna stop eating ursters just ‘cause you say oyster&hellip; let’s call the whole thing off.”), this record is traced indelibly across my brain.</p>
<p>Eventually I listened to more Connick, and then expanded my jazz horizons with Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk, but this was where it started for me.</p>

<p>This one’s kind of embarrassing so I’ll get it out of the way early in my series. As I noted yesterday, my early music was mostly classical. But 1990 was a significant year for me. I turned 13. My family moved from Nebraska to Texas. And somewhere along the way, I bought my first Christian pop album - Michael W. Smith’s <em>Go West Young Man</em>.</p>
<p>Listening back to it now, it’s not great. Definitely not MWS’ best record, and not my favorite of his as I look back on his discography now. But for 13-year-old me, it was groundbreaking to get into pop music. Electric guitars. Power ballads. An inadvisable rap verse to Love Crusade. I learned the ballads on the piano. My mother despaired for a while that I would just try to sound like MWS instead of finding my natural singing voice.</p>
<p>Sooner or later I’d get past the singing voice, but 30 years later I’m still singing at the piano. And if for some reason I stumble across the unmistakable first two chords from Place In This World, I’m suddenly back in 1990.</p>

<p>I got tagged on Facebook to do this project - share ten albums that greatly influenced my taste in music. One album per day for ten consecutive days. In theory for the Facebook version this is supposed to be without explanation&hellip; but I want to explain! So I&rsquo;m going to blog the explanations here.</p>
<p>I will say I found it a challenge to assemble the list not as ten <em>favorite</em> albums but ten influential albums. Since I&rsquo;m a musician myself, I really tried to pick albums that were formative for me as a musician, though a few of them slipped in that were formative for other reasons. I&rsquo;m also going to try to be somewhat chronological since these are a part of my story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start today with what formed me early - classical music. My parents' love for classical music rubbed off on me. I still have memories of my dad (who spent several years early in life as a high school band director) standing in front of the stereo conducting along to recordings of Beethoven symphonies. I started taking piano lessons at age 7 and continued through high school. But the first bit of classical music that latched on to me in a really significant way was Rachmaninov&rsquo;s second piano concerto.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the specific recording I listened to as a kid. I know it was on a cassette tape (remember those?) which I probably bought at Walmart. Rachmaninov hits the sweet spot on the classical to modern spectrum for me. Still strongly influenced by the late Romantic composers, tinges of the modern influences that his Russian counterparts would more fully embrace, but beautiful melodies and lush harmonies that are well suited for pianists with large hands. I hacked through a lot of this concerto in junior high and high school and while I never got very good at it I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>The recording I&rsquo;m sharing of it today is one that has become one of my favorites - Stephen Hough with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. It&rsquo;s fairly fast and rowdy compared to most other versions you hear. I think Sergei might approve. Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be on any of the streaming services. There is this YouTube video though of Hough talking about his new recording and playing a bit of it.</p>

			 <p>Back in the old days (say, before March 2020), my podcast listening tilted heavily toward current events. For my own mental well-being, that isn’t a good listening diet whilst being at home for weeks on end. So, in addition to my usual handful of sermon podcasts, what’s a guy to listen to? How about stories about people far worse off than ourselves?</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/fall-of-civ-banner.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Enter the <em><a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/">Fall of Civilizations Podcast</a></em>. Hosted by <a href="https://www.paulmmcooper.com/">Paul M. M. Cooper</a>, this podcast takes lengthy (90 minutes to 3 hours) looks at ancient civilizations, what drove them to flourish, and then what caused their downfall. Cooper is a British writer and archivist with a PhD focused on the cultural and literary significance of ruins. His podcast isn’t particularly fancy from a production standpoint - mostly him narrating, occasional voice actors reading historical documents, and some background music - but he delves into the history of great civilizations and brings them to life.</p>
<p>Over the last couple weeks I’ve listened with fascination as Cooper described the fall of <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/01/21/episode-one-of-fall-of-civilizations-is-now-live/">the Roman Empire in Britain</a>, the <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/01/21/episode-2-is-now-live/">Mediterranean Bronze Age</a>, and <a href="https://fallofcivilizationspodcast.com/2019/05/06/episode-5-of-fall-of-civilizations-is-now-live/">the Khmer Empire of medieval Cambodia</a>. (I didn’t get <em>that</em> one in college history class!) There are only ten episodes in total right now, so I only have another 8 or 10 hours of listening left ahead of me, but it’s been quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>If you’ve got an interest in ancient history or in hours of narration by a guy with a nice British accent, it’s worth a try. You can find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT6Y5JJPKe_JDMivpKgVXew">YouTube</a>, SoundCloud, or generally wherever you listen to podcasts.</p>

<p>I just finished up listening to <a href="https://www.fatherly.com/finding-fred-rogers-podcast/"><em>Finding Fred</em></a>, a short-series podcast about Fred Rogers. Podcast host Carvell Wallace does a really good job of examining the spiritual impact of and what we can learn from Mr. Rogers' life and ministry. In episode 9, I really appreciated this take on Jesus' words in Mark 14:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Mark 14:7, Jesus says &ldquo;the poor you will always have with you, and you can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.&rdquo; The idea is that one day Jesus would leave His followers. Like all things, he was saying, his presence was impermanent. The only permanent thing is that people will still need help, and we must continue to help those who need it. Notice he didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna be gone so I&rsquo;m gonna need you to keep on crushing all the bad guys and making sure *they* learn their lessons.&rdquo; His focus is not on fixing the bad ones, but on helping the needy ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard plenty of takes on this passage over my years in church, with interpretations all over the place from prioritizing Jesus' presence to (horribly) suggesting that it&rsquo;s a fruitless task to try to end poverty because Jesus said we&rsquo;d always have them. But I really appreciate this particular view of what Jesus was saying. The gospel also tells us that we have help for the &ldquo;bad people&rdquo;, too - and we&rsquo;re all in some sense &ldquo;bad people&rdquo; - but when it comes to how this practically applies to living out our faith in the world, caring for the poor and needy seems to be right at the forefront of Jesus' concern.</p>
<p>Oh, and the whole podcast is worth a listen if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing.</p>

			 <p>Continuing from <a href="/20/03/adam-young-on-hope-and-wrestling-with-god-1/">yesterday</a>, more from Adam Young&rsquo;s fantastic podcast <em><a href="https://adamyoungcounseling.com/podcast/">The Place We Find Ourselves</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately all disappointment carries with it the sense of a broken appointment with God. I expected God to show up and He didn&rsquo;t. God is the one who could&rsquo;ve prevented that illness and He didn&rsquo;t. He didn&rsquo;t show up. A broken appointment. A disappointment. One of the reasons we hate hope so much is it requires us to live a &ldquo;both-and&rdquo; kind of life.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Christians are meant to constantly hold together both death and resurrection. This is why Paul says we&rsquo;re to rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn. And many of us would rather live either/or. A life focused <em>solely</em> on resurrection is not hope, it&rsquo;s optimism. Hope has nothing to do with optimism. Optimism is a denial of the darkness that permeates this world. We don&rsquo;t live both/and well. We live primarily either/or.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Some of us focus on the darkness of this world, and we see it everywhere, but we have a hard time seeing the thousands of places where the Spirit of God is working everywhere and doing beautiful, redemptive things. Others of us focus on the beauty in this world but we turn a blind eye to all the evil right in front of us.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
But Christianity is both/and. A life of both/and means that you are just as apt to be weeping one moment as you are to be laughing the next. You are never far from weeping, because you have your eyes wide open to the darkness of this world. And you are never far from laughing, because you also see the thousands of places of God&rsquo;s redemptive work all around you.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
There&rsquo;s a spirit of optimism that has invaded the church. It appeals to us because it allows us to escape staying connected to the longings of our hearts. It allows us to turn away from darkness and pain, to pretend it isn&rsquo;t real.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Much of what you hear in Bible studies and small groups are sentences that shame you for admitting that you have longings, that you groan, that you yearn. What do you do in a group when someone expresses an unfulfilled longing? When someone expresses disappointment over not getting into a particular school, or anger over not being married, or sorrow over not being reconciled to their father? The tendency is to subtly do one of three things:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>encourage them to believe more in the sovereignty of God. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not God&rsquo;s will for you to get into that graduate school.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Wonder if they are idolizing that which they long for. &ldquo;It kinda sounds like you&rsquo;re making an idol out of being married, like that&rsquo;s too important to you.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Suggest that they are wanting too much. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t your expectations for your Dad too high? Is it really reasonable to hope for reconciliation with your Dad given his background?&rdquo;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
When you respond in one of those three ways, what&rsquo;s going on? The expression of the other person&rsquo;s sorrow, anger, disappointment, exposes your deep discomfort with those emotions in your own life. That&rsquo;s often times what&rsquo;s happening. And you respond to the person with the same set of sentences you use on yourself to keep your desires under control. You&rsquo;re not being hypocritical. You&rsquo;re not even necessarily being cruel. You&rsquo;re just telling them what you tell yourself.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Are you familiar with the parable of the persistent widow? Jesus tells this story in Luke 18. A widow keeps going back to a judge to demand that she get justice against the person that harms her. And because the widow keeps coming back to insist on her case, the judge finally relents and helps her. And then Jesus says this: &ldquo;will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night. Will He keep putting them off?&rdquo;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Here&rsquo;s the point: it&rsquo;s not called &ldquo;the parable of the widow who learned to surrender to God&rsquo;s will&rdquo;. The whole point is that she refused to take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer. She knew nothing of &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s not God&rsquo;s will for me to get justice against this particular adversary&rdquo;. She refused to take &ldquo;no&rdquo; for an answer.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So, how much hope do you have? The danger is thinking you just need to conjure up more hope. Two problems with that, first, that you can&rsquo;t. But the bigger problem is that you actually have far more hope than you realize. You may not be fond of it, but will you have the integrity to confess how much hope you actually still have.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Think of all the disappointments that you&rsquo;ve endured in your life. Think of all the prayers you&rsquo;ve prayed, all the times you&rsquo;ve called out to God and he has not come through for you the way you&rsquo;ve wanted. And yet. You&rsquo;re still interested in God. You&rsquo;re still talking to God. You&rsquo;re still pursuing God. You haven&rsquo;t given up on God. You&rsquo;re wanting healing or help in some are of your life, and you&rsquo;ve gone to God about it, and the healing or the help has not come. That&rsquo;s tormenting. And yet you still come back to God. You still pursue God. You think about God. You may pray, you may read Scripture, but you keep coming back. The Bible calls that hope.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The people who have suffered trauma, abuse, heartache, often have immense love for Jesus and immense hope. They often hate the hope that they have, but they have it. What Paul wrote in Romans seems to be a good description of what happens in their life: suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. Do the math: suffering leads often to creation of a robust hope in the very people who have the least evidence to suggest that hope is reasonable.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In a very real sense, our hope is not merely <em>in God</em> - our hope IS God. The essence of rescue is not primarily receiving that which you asked for, but rather experiencing the responsiveness of God to the hurt in your heart. It&rsquo;s not the school or the healing or the relationship that satisfies us; it is the satisfaction, the rest of knowing that I have a Father in heaven who is deeply involved in the desires of my heart. I have a Father that cares. I have a Father that responds. Will you hope? Will you entertain your longings and give them an audience before God? Will you give your disappointments back to God to keep your desires alive?</li>
</ol>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A friend recently pointed me to Adam Young&rsquo;s podcast <em><a href="https://adamyoungcounseling.com/podcast/">The Place We Find Ourselves</a></em>. As a licensed social worker who has certifications in counseling and also an MDiv, Young thoughtfully combines psychological and emotional insights with Biblical truth in a way I haven&rsquo;t encountered before. This morning the last 8 minutes of his <a href="http://theplacewefindourselves.libsyn.com/18-why-your-story-makes-it-hard-to-hope">Episode 18</a> discussion on hope and wrestling with God were just golden. The quote is long so I&rsquo;ll split it into a couple posts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God says &ldquo;those who hope in Me won&rsquo;t be disappointed&rdquo;&hellip;. the difficulty is that you don&rsquo;t know which of your longings God will meet in the land of the living, and you don&rsquo;t want to wrestle with God about meeting those particular desires. Herein lies the biggest reason we hate hope: hope forces us to wrestle with God.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Most wrestling with God is avoided by a very simple phrase: &ldquo;if it be Your will&rdquo;. You express a desire to God and then you tack on this phrase. &ldquo;If it be Your will.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not my will, but Yours be done.&rdquo; Right? That&rsquo;s the sentence. And it is a beautiful sentence, as long as it comes after a 12-round match of wrestling with God.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Now, you may be thinking &lsquo;wait a minute, aren&rsquo;t we supposed to surrender our will to God&rsquo;s will?&rsquo; Yes! But that&rsquo;s just the point. You&rsquo;re called to <em>surrender</em> your will to God&rsquo;s will. And what does surrender mean? It is to give in after a long, drawn-out bloody war. You can&rsquo;t surrender until you have fought with God. And generals never surrender until they have fought to the end of their strength. Surrender only comes in a moment of exhaustion.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If you&rsquo;re not exhausted from fighting with God, from bringing the longings of your heart repeatedly to God, then the words &ldquo;not my will but Yours be done&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t words of surrender. They are words to avoid hope. Which is to avoid warring and wrestling with your God. You can&rsquo;t talk about hope without talking about wrestling.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
If you don&rsquo;t find yourself regularly wrestling with God, chances are you don&rsquo;t live with much hope. Because hope creates longing in you, and unfulfilled longings drive you to God, because God is the only one that can satisfy the longing. God is the only one that can make that thing happen. Until you take the risk of hoping that God will fulfill the desires of your heart <em>in this life</em>, until you bring your disappointment and anger to Him again and again, God will always remain strangely impersonal to you. You might know him as God the savior of the world, but you won&rsquo;t know Him as what the Psalmists call &lsquo;the God of my rescue&rsquo;.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/02/04/an-iowans-thoughts.html">An Iowan&#39;s thoughts the morning after the 2020 Caucus</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2020/02/04/an-iowans-thoughts.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-04 07:47:13 -0500">Feb 4, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last night I and thousands of Iowans like me participated in the Democratic Party caucus. After three chaotic years of a Trump presidency and more than a year of non-stop campaigning in our state, it felt good to get on with things. Regardless of the result, we know the ads will stop for at least a few months now.</p>
<p>My caucus experience was pretty low key and without major hassles or snafus.</p>
<p>Late last night, though, the reports started rolling in that there are hiccups in the party reporting. As I write this at 6:30 the morning after, there are still no results reported. Half of the candidates have declared victory (or at least success), Republican operatives are spinning claims of fraud and manipulation, and once again Iowa looks like a bunch of rubes who can&rsquo;t even figure out how to tabulate votes.</p>
<p>So, a few thoughts on Tuesday morning:</p>
<p><strong>This is ridiculous.</strong> Campaigns and volunteers have spent countless hours and dollars here over the past year to court our first-in-the-nation voters, and we can&rsquo;t even get an accurate count at the end of the night? The caucus format is quaint (or, <a href="https://twitter.com/kootenayrev/status/1224506061777801221?s=20">as a Canadian friend said</a>, &ldquo;quirky&rdquo;), but if in 2020 we can&rsquo;t even manage to report up simple voter counts, some other state should be going first.</p>
<p><strong>We will get reliable results eventually.</strong> I have no doubt that the votes were carefully tabulated at my caucus site, and that they have a paper trail of every ballot preference card that was filled out. The volunteers running the caucus worked diligently to get an accurate count. Surely a similar scenario played out at each other caucus site through the evening. The data is available and reliable.</p>
<p><strong>This is not an election and isn&rsquo;t run by our election staff.</strong> This point can easily be missed in this morning&rsquo;s reporting chaos. Normal elections in Iowa are overseen by the Iowa Secretary of State, and run in each county by the County Auditor. When we have the actual November election, each voter will fill out a paper ballot and feed it into a scanning machine with a locked collection bin. An electronic count is available almost immediately with paper backups in case a recount is needed. It&rsquo;s a reliable system. <strong>That system was NOT used last night.</strong> Last night&rsquo;s caucuses were run and results tabulated by volunteers from the political parties. They only do this once every four years. It shows.</p>
<p><strong>This is a system ripe for change.</strong> The election cycle is far too long. The caucus system is antiquated. Iowa has no particular business being the first in the nation. Let&rsquo;s try shortening campaign windows. Let&rsquo;s have just a handful of primary election days on the schedule, with multiple states participating each time. Let&rsquo;s have <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used">ranked choice voting</a>. (Oh, let&rsquo;s also make sure everyone has access to vote and encourage as much voting participation as we can.) We can do better.</p>

			 <p>Good journalism is one of those things everybody wants to have available to benefit from, but fewer are interested in paying for. I&rsquo;m hardly a paragon of virtue in this regard, but I have gotten to the point where there are several journalistic establishments or efforts that I&rsquo;m happy to support via paid subscriptions. Currently that list includes (in alphabetical order):</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theathletic.com/"><em>The Athletic</em></a></strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve known this one was around for a while, but finally bit the bullet after reading a couple really excellent articles for free. Really solid sports journalism. Something interesting to read pretty much every day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/"><em>The Atlantic</em></a></strong><br>
Middle-of-the road current events writing and opinion. My digital subscription includes a subscription to the monthly print edition. I counted it success this week when I actually finished reading last month&rsquo;s issue within the same week that the new issue was delivered. Thoughtful stuff, worth my time.</p>
<p><em>Let me just interject here that these first two have excellent iOS apps, but dang if their app icons don&rsquo;t both just feature large capital &lsquo;A&rsquo;s. At least a little bit confusing.</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/phone-icons.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>I mean, really&hellip;</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thegazette.com/"><em>The Gazette</em> (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)</a></strong><br>
My local daily newspaper. Independently owned, which is a rarity these days. There are only so many newsworthy things to write about in a city of 150,000 people, but I&rsquo;m happy to put some dollars to supporting their efforts.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/">Iowa Public Radio</a></strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve been a low-grade supporter of IPR for several years now. There are pretty much only 3 things that ever get played on my car radio (at least when it&rsquo;s under my control): podcasts, Cubs baseball, and IPR.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://popular.info/"><em>Popular Info</em> by Judd Legum</a></strong><br>
Less of an establishment pick here. Judd Legum is an independent journalist who publishes <em>Popular.Info</em>, a newsletter focused on accountability specifically for Facebook and how Facebook handles political topics and advertising. He&rsquo;s been able to make enough noise in some rather egregious situations that Facebook has been forced to respond and make changes. It&rsquo;s hard to underestimate the impact that Facebook is having on our national political conversation, so I&rsquo;m glad to have somebody poking at it on the regular.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com"><em>The Washington Post</em></a></strong><br>
I want to have access to one of the major national newspapers of record. I&rsquo;ve subscribed to both the <em>Post</em> and <em>The New York Times</em> at various times, but the <em>Post</em> has tended to provide more stories I was really interested in and less times when I wanted to throw my phone across the room while reading. (Thankfully the NYT crossword app can be subscribed to separately!)</p>

			 <p>After reading more than 80 books in 2019, there&rsquo;s a part of me that is getting a little squirmy knowing that it&rsquo;s two weeks into January and I haven&rsquo;t completed a single book yet this year. But there&rsquo;s a good reason for that. (It&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t been reading&hellip;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tk3mRD">Charles Taylor&rsquo;s <em>A Secular Age</em></a> on my radar (and my Kindle) for a couple years now. Several of the popular-level books I&rsquo;ve read in recent years have drawn on him heavily, leading me to believe I should really dig in and give him a shot myself. I&rsquo;ve tried starting the book twice before, both times giving up about half-way through the introduction.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/a-secular-age.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>A Secular Age</em> is not for the faint of heart. It&rsquo;s nearly 900 pages long, with a vocabulary that makes me thankful for the Kindle&rsquo;s built-in dictionary and Wikipedia lookups. I feel like I&rsquo;ve worked <em>hard</em> reading it and I just passed the 50% mark. But it&rsquo;s been worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>Taylor observes that between the years 1500 and 2000 we as a Western society have moved from a culture in which it was almost impossible to not believe in God and see a strong overlap between the physical and spiritual realms, to a culture in which it&rsquo;s not abnormal to have an entirely secular perspective on the universe and dismiss the spiritual altogether. <em>A Secular Age</em> is his attempt at telling the story of how we got there, and it has provided some fascinating insights.</p>
<p>So, maybe I&rsquo;ll only finish one book in January. But I&rsquo;m OK with that. The goal is learning, not just consumption.</p>

			 <p>The beginning of a new year means a quick look back first at last year’s reading in review. (Some people put these lists out at the end of the year&hellip; I’m still adding books to the list until the very end, so New Year’s Day it is!) I’ve posted a few compendiums (compendia?) through the year and highlighted some favorites as I went, so I’ll just do a brief wrap-up here.</p>
<p>My 2019 reading is all <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?order=a&amp;shelf=2019-reads&amp;sort=date_read">logged over on Goodreads</a> (as is everything I’ve read since 2007!). Somehow I got through 82 books in 2019 - the most I’ve ever read in a year. 33 of those were fiction&hellip; which left a lot of non-fiction, mostly theology and history. I read 23 by female authors this year, which is more than previous years, though not quite as many as I had hoped to get to.</p>
<p>Favorite fiction of the year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Virgil Wander</em> by Leif Enger</li>
<li><em>Pachinko</em> by Min Jin Lee</li>
<li><em>Wanderers</em> by Chuck Wendig</li>
<li><em>Laurus</em> by Eugene Vodolazkin</li>
</ul>
<p>Favorite non-fiction of the year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>A Song for Nagasaki</em> by Paul Glynn</li>
<li><em>In The Shelter: Finding a Home in the World</em> by Padraig O Tuama</li>
<li><em>Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America</em> by Chris Arnade</li>
<li><em>What Is A Girl Worth?</em> by Rachael Denhollander</li>
<li><em>God in the Rainforest: A Tale of Martyrdom and Redemption in Amazonian Ecuador</em> by Kathryn T. Long</li>
<li><em>Paul and Gender: Reclaiming the Apostle’s Vision for Men and Women in Christ</em> by Cynthia Long Westfall </li>
<li><em>Hannah’s Child: A Theologian’s Memoir</em> by Stanley Hauerwas</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2020 I’d really like to find a little more fiction that engages me. I’ve picked up several novels this year only to have them completely fail to capture my interest enough to go on with them. I have a plenty big pile of unread books next to my bed and on my Kindle to work through.</p>
<p>Alternately, I could probably spend the whole year just reading Charles Taylor’s <em>A Secular Age</em> and David Foster Wallace’s <em>Infinite Jest</em>&hellip; and chase it with something really long from N. T. Wright. </p>
<p>Here’s to another year of reading!</p>

			 <p>Took the family to see Rian Johnson’s latest film, <em>Knives Out</em>, this afternoon. I know Johnson is a big-name filmmaker at this point - writing and directing an episode of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise will do that for you. But I still feel like I knew him back when, thanks to the guys on the <em>Filmspotting</em> podcast championing his work from the very beginning. Having watched <em>Brick</em>, <em>The Brothers Bloom</em>, and <em>Looper</em>, I had a good feeling about <em>The Last Jedi</em>, and when <em>Knives Out</em> was announced, I was ready to buy tickets immediately.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Knives Out</em> is Johnson’s take on the whodunnit genre, <em>a la</em> Agatha Christie. That means to avoid spoilers I shouldn’t really say anything more about it. But I have a few non-spoilery thoughts.</p>
<p>First: Rian Johnson is a master of taking genre movies bending the genre ever so slightly for a knowing audience. He did it with <em>film noir</em> in Brick, and with time travel movies in <em>Looper</em>. Suffice to say he does it again masterfully here in <em>Knives Out</em>.</p>
<p>Second: That closing shot is the best I’ve seen in years. It’s just perfect.</p>
<p>Finally: now knowing how it ends, I really want to go watch it again to see how much it telegraphed early on that I completely missed. Johnson is careful enough that I doubt there are many (any) loose ends.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2019/11/24/frozen-ii-a.html">Frozen II: A Very 2019 Movie</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2019/11/24/frozen-ii-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-24 21:40:00 -0500">Nov 24, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It’s been just long enough since the original Frozen came out, and my girls have aged just enough, that we didn’t end up at the theater on opening night for <em>Frozen II</em>. But by Sunday afternoon we decided to brave the horde of preschoolers and their parents. The older two probably felt a little too old for it. The youngest, though, was first in line to get in the theater door, and was on the edge of her seat in excitement for the whole show.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Frozen II</em> is quite clearly a Disney mega-picture. More of what worked from the first one: comical Olaf the snowman; genial Kristof voicing his reindeer’s thoughts; the briefest cameo from Oaken who has exited the spa and is now giving manicures. The new songs weren’t as catchy as those from the original -  they felt much more like Broadway narrative than tidy pop songs. <em>Frozen II</em> isn’t the timeless classic that its predecessor was, but it is very much a movie for our time - a very 2019 movie.</p>
<p><em>(Spoilers to follow&hellip;)</em></p>
<p>Let’s start with the main plot of the movie. Elsa discovers that her grandfather brought modern technology (in this case, a river dam) to the indigenous northern peoples only to betray them. Two generations later, that technology is ruining the land and imprisoning the people who live there. Elsa and Anna determine the only solution is to tear down the dam, regardless of the potential cost to their city. Can you hear the echoes of our growing American recognition of the evils of Columbus and the slave trade?</p>
<p>Then there’s dear, naive Olaf, singing about how he’s young now and the world doesn’t make sense, but that he’s so glad it’ll make more sense when he gets older. Yeah, Olaf, keep hoping.</p>
<p>If the grim hopelessness of a confusing world gets too tough, don’t worry - there’s 4 minutes of humor and irony directly ahead. Kristof needs a song too, after all. What he gets is a send-up of every late 80’s power ballad music video ever, complete with the fade-ins and -outs, shadowy reindeer backup singers, and soulful guitar solos.  This scene is going to seem dated pretty quickly as the movie ages, but for now the irony is thick and aimed directly at the parents who will sit through this thing a million times once it comes to Disney+.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most helpful and hopeful theme from <em>Frozen II</em> is another thought aimed right at the heart of 2019. Through the movie, both Anna and Elsa come upon situations that seem bigger than they can handle. They want to solve problems but the problems seem insurmountable. Whatever should they do? And then the old wisdom comes to them: <strong>“do the next right thing”</strong>. You may not be able to see the end yet. But look around for the right thing to do&hellip; and do it. Overly simplistic? Maybe. But maybe not terrible advice for citizens of 2019, either.</p>
<p>I came home from <em>Frozen II</em> thankful that there’s no equivalent to “Let It Go” to become the soundtrack in our house for the next year. (And also realizing I should show my kids a Richard Marx video so they get the spoof.) At a cinema where the adjoining screens were showing a woke remake of <em>Charlie’s Angels</em> and a movie about Mr. Rogers, <em>Frozen II</em> fits right in as a product of, and a message for, an audience weary of 2019.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2r3exlU"><strong><em>A Short History of Nearly Everything</em></strong> <strong>by Bill Bryson</strong></a><br>
A quick engaging read. But honestly, Bryson&rsquo;s prose is <em>so</em> breezy and clever that I&rsquo;m inclined to distrust it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/37gZrd0"><em>Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America&rsquo;s Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan</em> by Steve Coll</a></strong><br>
A knowledgeable, detailed overview of the CIA&rsquo;s involvement in those regions over the past decade. Interesting stuff. Also annoying that the author and his editor apparently believed it to be necessary to include the periods in abbreviating <em>Central Intelligence Agency</em> as &ldquo;C. I. A.&rdquo; every single time it appeared in the book. Every. Single. Time.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2r6EW22"><em>Wanderers</em> by Chuck Wendig</a></strong><br>
Equal parts Stephen King and Michael Crichton. Really entertaining dystopian sci-fi/horror.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2r6474P"><em>Noughts &amp; Crosses</em> by Malorie Blackman</a></strong><br>
Dystopian YA where the twist is that blacks are the race in power and whites are just gaining their freedom. Not as much done with that twist as there should&rsquo;ve been if that&rsquo;s the key conceit of the novel, but it wasn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/344eAfU"><em>The Kremlin Strike</em> by Dale Brown</a></strong><br>

<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2XqwE1d"><em>The Overstory</em> by Richard Powers</a></strong><br>
Mindless entertainment this one was not. A curiously-crafted novel with short stories that provide background for the main characters who drive the second half of the novel. All about trees. Yes, trees. Oh, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and was shortlisted for the Man Booker.</p>

I want to read the next book in the series!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2QIxBkf"><em>The Fifth Column</em> by Andrew Gross</a></strong><br>
Fairly basic adventure novel set in 1940&rsquo;s New York focused on German spies living in the USA. Quick, light read.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="http://www.padraigotuama.com/">Pádraig Ó Tuama</a>&rsquo;s wonderful <em><a href="https://amzn.to/31Wq3Nd">In the Shelter: Finding a Home In the World</a></em>. His reading of this bit of the story about the Gadarene Demoniac from Mark 5 took my breath away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus asks him what his name is. The man answers:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
' My name is Legion, for we are many.'<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
This can be read in so many ways. The word &lsquo;legion&rsquo; is a militaristic word, and the Roman legion who had decamped to this particular geographic area bore the boar as their standard on their banners. This answer of the anonymous man can also be understood simply, and powerfully, as an indication of the dignity of language.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; he was asked. And he answered, &lsquo;I am what has afflicted me.&rsquo; How many of us know the truth of this? When we are towards the end of ourselves, we begin to believe that we are only what we struggle with. The man here tells us a truth that is awful - we baptise ourselves with names that are far from the only truth about ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a beautiful lesson here - that what is true about each of us is far more than the struggles that we so often identify with. I am far more than my sin or my worry or my illness. I am a beloved child of God, and Jesus sees, and calls me to see, that truth transcending my afflictions.</p>

			 <p>About a year ago I started getting interested in historical criticism as it relates to the Bible. As I explored and read several books, I kept wondering: where was this discussion, or even the acknowledgement of this topic, in the evangelical tradition in which I grew up?</p>
<p>Most all I’ve ever encountered in evangelicalism in this area is that the Bible is made of up 66 books, that they’re “inspired” and “inerrant”, with varying levels of nuance about what those terms mean. I can’t remember ever hearing a discussion about how, when, or by whom the books of the OT and NT were assembled; only that that the collection of 66 is canonical and that’s basically that.</p>
<p>Where, I lamented on Twitter, were any evangelical takes on anything approaching historical criticism? This question did lead to a dear Episcopal priest in Wisconsin sending me three of his seminary textbooks on the topic (thanks again, Rev. Mike!), but from the evangelical perspective, I didn’t encounter anything much more nuanced than what I found on the “God said it, I believe it, that settles it” bumper sticker.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Enter Dr. Craig Allert’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2M6xqej">A High View of Scripture?: The Authority of the Bible and the Formation of the New Testament Canon</a>.</em> Allert is a professing evangelical and professor at Trinity Western University in British Columbia. <em>A High View of Scripture?</em> is published by Baker Academic as a part of their “Evangelical <em>Ressourcement</em>” series. The book’s purpose, says Allert in the introduction, is to “investigat[e] the implications of the formation of the New Testament canon on evangelical doctrines of Scripture.”</p>
<p>This study has been lacking in evangelicalism, he says, and we are poorer for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The] neglect of the canon process has left evangelicals with an inadequate understanding of the very Bible we view and appropriate as authoritative. For the most part, evangelicals seem unconcerned with how we actually got our Bible, and when we do show interest, we rarely relate the implications of this concern to how this might affect a doctrine of Scripture. This is ironic since evangelicals hav been quite loud in proclaiming the ultimate authority of the Bible; surely that proclamation should be informed about how the Bible came to be.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Dr. Craig Allert, <em>A High View of Scripture?,</em> p. 12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>A High View of Scripture?</em>, Allert draws heavily on the church fathers and early church writings to distinguish between <em>Scripture</em> and <em>canon</em>, to explore how the word “inspiration” was used early on to describe various writings <em>and</em> practices, both canonical and not, and how the church wrestled with the question of what writings were considered canonical well into the 4th century.</p>
<p>After taking a few chapters to overview the history, Allert asks some hard questions about how we should have that history inform our doctrine of Scripture. How should it affect our understanding of Scripture when we acknowledge that these “inspired” texts were not delivered on a platter as an autographed, bound volume, but were assembled and agreed upon <em>by the church</em> over a period of more than three hundred years?</p>
<p>Allert affirms the authority and inspiration of Scripture, but balks at “inerrancy”, since the Scripture doesn’t use that word of itself, and since the definitions of “inerrancy” are challenging, frequently seeming to be constructed <em>post hoc</em> in support of the theologian’s predetermined interpretations. While evangelicals prefer to be known as focused on “the Book” and dismissive of “tradition”, Allert insists that we can’t have a healthy doctrine and understanding of Scripture without acknowledging and embracing the fact that the early church played a key role in the formation of the canon of Scripture and what it means.</p>
<p>I very much appreciated <em>A High View of Scripture?</em> and would highly recommend it to my evangelical friends. We need more of this sort of thing. Not to use historical “criticism” to diminish the Scripture, but to reject the impulse to skittishly rush past canon formation on our way to Scriptural authority, and to recognize that our reliance on the Scripture need not be weakened by acknowledgement of the human participation in its writing and assembly.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Qktps9">The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt: The History of a Civilization from 3000 BC to Cleopatra</a></em> by Toby Wilkinson</strong><br>
The book wasn&rsquo;t quite as long as the empire. Still trying to get my head around a legitimate empire that spanned millennia. Astounding.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30tmDA4">Palace Walk</a></em> by Naguib Mahfouz</strong><br>
I remember almost nothing about this book.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Oariof">On The Neurobiology of Sin</a></em> by Lazar Puhalo</strong><br>
A short treatise by an Orthodox bishop addressing, among other things, homosexuality and transgenderism. Reads like an undergraduate-level paper on genetics combined with a couple weak blog posts on theology. I was disappointed.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2LDYEdx">The Inner Kingdom</a></em> by Kallistos Ware</strong><br>
A collection of essays from an Eastern Orthodox bishop.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/308IIsA">God Land: A Story of Faith, Loss, and Renewal in Middle America</a></em> by Lyz Lenz</strong><br>

<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/30vm8Fy">Laurus</a></em> by Eugene Vodolazkin</strong><br>
Now <em>this</em> one was well worth reading. A beautiful novel about a medieval Russian &ldquo;holy fool&rdquo;. Rod Dreher has <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-wonder-working-laurus/">a nice piece about it</a> if you want to read more.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2LG9X4Z">Normal People</a></em> by Sally Rooney</strong><br>

Start at the end of Romans, Dr. McKnight says, understand the context and audience, and then work your way back to get a better perspective on what the doctrinal passages mean. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Qtg1BU">The Bird King</a></em> by G. Willow Wilson</strong><br>
Picked up at random off the library shelf. A fantasy novel from a Middle Eastern Muslim perspective. Enjoyed it, though didn&rsquo;t feel like the last third held up to the promise of the first two-thirds.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2M6Nvka">The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race</a></em> by Willie James Jennings</strong><br>
Oh man, this one was thick. A hard read but some good insight.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/306MfYi">Alif the Unseen</a></em> by G. Willow Wilson</strong><br>

<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OcfRwa">What Is a Girl Worth?: My Story of Breaking the Silence and Exposing the Truth about Larry Nassar and USA Gymnastics</a></em> by Rachael Denhollander</strong><br>
I knew this woman was a hero for publicly coming forward with allegations of sexual abuse against Nasser. What I didn&rsquo;t realize before reading the memoir was how integral she was in every part of building and executing the case against him. So much to love about this book and its heroes, Rachael and her faithful husband Jacob.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/308Jc0U">Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America</a></em> by Chris Arnade</strong><br>

			 <blockquote>
<p>Here is my servant, whom I uphold<br>
my chosen, in whom my soul delights<br>
I have put my spirit upon him;<br>
he will bring forth justice to the nations.<br>
He will not cry or lift up his voice,<br>
or make it heard in the street;<br>
a bruised reed he will not break,<br>
and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;<br>
He will not grow faint or be crushed until he has established justice in the earth;<br>
and the coastlands wait for his teaching.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>Isaiah 42:1-4, NRSV</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often when I have read this passage or ones like it my first inclination is to think of this &ldquo;justice&rdquo; being established as a punishing sort of justice. God sends his servant, the Messiah, to justly deal with sin by punishing the bad guys. That&rsquo;s largely how we&rsquo;ve been taught, at least within my faith tradition, to think about God&rsquo;s justice - as something punitive and to be feared.</p>
<p>But then we get to Matthew 12.</p>
<p>The Pharisees confront Jesus about his disciples picking grain on the sabbath. Jesus rebukes the Pharisees. &ldquo;If you had known what this means, &lsquo;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&rsquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless.&rdquo; Jesus then goes into the synagogue and provokes them further by healing a man on the sabbath. Which drives the Pharisees to start conspiring how to destroy Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Jesus became aware of this [that the Pharisees were conspiring to destroy him], he departed. Many crowds followed him, and he cured all of them, and he ordered them not to make him known. This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;Here is my servant, whom I have chosen,<br>
my beloved, with whom my soul is well pleased.<br>
I will put my Spirit upon him,<br>
and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.<br>
He will not wrangle or cry aloud,<br>
nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.<br>
He will not break a bruised reed<br>
or quench a smoldering wick<br>
until he brings justice to victory.<br>
And in his name the Gentiles will hope.&rdquo;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Matthew 12:15-21, NRSV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brought me up short when I read it this morning. <em>This</em> is what it looked like for Jesus to bring forth and establish justice. He rebuked the abusive religious traditions and hypocritical religious teachers. He healed. He didn&rsquo;t just heal a few of them - read the words! &ldquo;He cured all of them&rdquo;!</p>
<p>What if, when we think about God&rsquo;s justice, this is what comes to mind? Not a fearsome, punishing justice against sinners, but a loving restoration? A rebuke of abusive tradition? Jesus taking broken lives and bodies and making them whole? A justice that says &lsquo;this is not how things were intended to be, and so I am making things right again&rsquo;?</p>
<p>This is a justice not to be feared but to be longed for.</p>

<p>With a kid under the weather after some dental work, it was a good night for a family movie. The library provided the convenient loan of a nostalgia pick for Becky and me: <em>Chain Reaction</em>, the 1996 film starring Keanu Reeves, Morgan Freeman, and Rachel Weisz.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me before I looked it up, I would’ve guessed this came out when I was still in high school, since I remember watching it a handful of times back in what feels like that timeframe. But, since it came out in ‘96, I probably watched it for the first time at the dollar theater in Longview, TX while I was in college, probably with Becky along on a cheap date.</p>
<p>My first thought when starting the movie was “wow, this reminds me in a lot of ways of <em>The Fugitive</em>”. All the Chicago scenery, a bunch of the same guys playing Chicago cops, familiar shots of midwestern woods and small waterways&hellip; then I looked it up on IMDB and quite belatedly realized that Andrew Davis directed both movies. No surprise then, that they look the same.</p>
<p>The plot is about as spare as I remember it - Reeves’ team makes some scientific breakthrough to generate cheap electricity from hydrogen, and his lab is blown up before they can publicize. Morgan Freeman is the shifty leader of the foundation providing Reeves’ funding, who may or may not be bankrolled by the CIA. That’s about as much plot as you need, as the middle of the movie ends up being a series of chases across a drawbridge in downtown Chicago, a frozen lake (with a fan-powered airboat!) in Wisconsin, and through the Natural History museum in Washington DC.</p>
<p><em>Chain Reaction</em> is innocuous enough, drawing just enough charisma from Morgan Freeman and enough action through the Chicago landscape to keep the family at least mildly interested for 100 minutes. I was surprised at how much of it I remembered, having not watched it for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, now it just makes me want to watch <em>The Fugitive</em>. Same Chicago chase scenes, but Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford as the cat and mouse&hellip; if only they’d had a role for Morgan Freeman in it, they might’ve <em>really</em> had something.</p>

			 <p>Because it&rsquo;s been a while&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of topics have rattled around in my head&hellip; none have congealed enough for a real post. Oh well.</li>
<li>We did an Alaska vacation in July. It was amazing. It&rsquo;s really kind of sad that I haven&rsquo;t posted anything about it so far.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s September, which means my summer cheering for the first-place Chicago Cubs has faded into a fall where the Cubs fade and likely just miss the playoffs. Fortunately football season has started. Now if only the Huskers could win a little more consistently&hellip;</li>
<li>I listened to some old school Caedmon&rsquo;s Call last week and was reminded why I loved that group. So tight.</li>
<li>In the spirit of supporting local journalism, last week I subscribed to our local newspaper. My kids think it just means I&rsquo;m old.</li>
<li>My goal for book buying and reading was to keep the book pile shorter than my bedside table. Then I split the pile into two piles and now the goal is to keep each of them shorter than the bedside table. I really just need to find room for another bookshelf somewhere.</li>
<li>Oh, and my kids are probably right - I am just getting old.</li>
<li>Without mentioning titles, I can tell you off the top of my head that I have books in my to-read stack by Chris Arnade, David Bentley Hart, Fleming Rutledge, Bradley Jersak, Craig Allert, Justin Earley, and tomorrow will add one by Rachael Denhollander.

<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2xKuUE2">Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch</a></em> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman</strong><br>
Somehow I&rsquo;d not read this before, and with all the buzz on the Amazon TV series, figured it was worth giving it a try. I find Pratchett an acquired taste&hellip; one which I&rsquo;m not totally on board with yet. Still, a fun read.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2XXrZXi">Paul and Gender: Reclaiming the Apostle&rsquo;s Vision for Men and Women in Christ</a></em> by Cynthia Long Westfall</strong><br>
Dr. Westfall brings her incredible expertise in Greek to bear on the Pauline texts about gender and gender roles within the church. Thorough and scholarly yet readable, she makes a strong case for an egalitarian position. Worth a read if you&rsquo;re interested in this area of debate.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2JsYq7R">The Song of the Lark</a></em> by Willa Cather</strong><br>
Continuing my read of Cather&rsquo;s Great Plains Trilogy&hellip; a nice change of pace.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2YNKpXt">God in the Rainforest: A Tale of Martyrdom and Redemption in Amazonian Ecuador</a></em> by Kathryn T. Long</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Say the names Jim and Elisabeth Elliot to anybody who grew up in the evangelical church and you&rsquo;ll almost certainly get quick recognition of the story of missionaries trying to reach a remote Ecuadorian tribe, and of the five men who were killed by that tribe after initiating contact. Elisabeth Elliot&rsquo;s account of their efforts in <em>Through Gates of Splendor</em> became a bestseller the year after their deaths.</p>
<p>In <em>God in the Rainforest</em>, Dr. Long (Professor Emerita of History at Wheaton College) gives a historian&rsquo;s critical eye to the long story of missionary contact and involvement with the Huaorani people in Ecuador. She manages to be incredibly evenhanded, avoiding the hagiography of <em>Through Gates of Splendor</em> and its follow-ups and examining the effects (both positive and negative) of the introduction of Western culture and Christianity to a previously unreached people group.</p>
<p>This one got particularly interesting for me because my wife&rsquo;s parents served for decades with one of the missions organizations involved there and know those people, to the point that at least one of the people named in the book attended our wedding.</p>
<p>Separating missions work from our Western impulse to colonialize is an ongoing struggle. <em>God in the Rainforest</em> gives a fair view of how that struggle played out in the jungles of Ecuador in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Y0tfJ4">How to Forget: A Daughter&rsquo;s Memoir</a></em> by Kate Mulgrew</strong><br>
I don&rsquo;t remember who recommended this one. Turns out it was a short but not easy read. Mulgrew (probably best known as an actress for playing Captain Janeway on Star Trek: Voyager) didn&rsquo;t have a very happy childhood or very good relationship with her parents. Mulgrew uses uses the story of her parents' final years to frame her reflections on her childhood and younger life, and grapples with how to deal with the realities of her youth as she looks back.</p>

			 <p>Richard Beck has a series going on an approach he calls &ldquo;post-progressive Christianity&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve appreciated it a lot as he works to identify the good things progressive strains of Christianity have to offer but also where they fall short. I found <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2019/07/post-progressive-christianity-part-6.html">his recent post on Love</a> to particularly hit the mark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that to say, progressive Christians, because they preach inclusion and tolerance, tend to see themselves as lovers in contrast to their more judgmental evangelical counterparts. And in the eyes of the world, yes, progressive Christians are more tolerant and inclusive, more likely to welcome the &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; who are shunned by evangelical churches.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And yet, when it comes to <em><strong>cruciform</strong></em> love, loving our <em><strong>enemies</strong></em>, progressive Christians are no more loving than evangelical Christians. That&rsquo;s a hard thing to say, but are progressive Christians doing a better job at loving the people they consider wicked? As we are all well aware, there is an intolerance associated with tolerance, and this intolerance has left its mark upon how love is expressed with progressive Christianity, although many try valiantly to resist this influence. The sad irony is that an ideal of tolerance simply creates a new definition of &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; And once that &ldquo;evil&rdquo; group is identified, it becomes really hard to love them. In fact, it&rsquo;s downright <em><strong>immoral</strong></em> to love them&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian Zahnd made a very similar point at the <a href="https://www.watertowinegathering.com/">Water to Wine Gathering</a> last month: when you hate the haters, hate wins. The challenge is to remain lovers, for the love of many will grow cold.</p>
<p>Whether we claim the label &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; or no label at all beside &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;, the distinguishing mark of cruciform (cross-shaped) Christianity is that of <em>love</em>, even (especially?) love for enemy.</p>

			 <p>I’ve spent a few hours now sitting down with my 13-year-old daughter to watch the two nights of Democratic debates. (Yay for a kid who is interested in politics!) And while it was interesting to see 20 people on stage, it’s definitely time to weed some candidates out.</p>
<p>Can we continue the race with just Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Julian Castro?</p>
<p>The other folks are mostly nice and all, but clearly don’t have what it’s going to take to lead a national campaign that can win. Sure, Biden and Bernie are polling well, but they’re so obviously old. It’s time for some younger candidates. (And yes, Elizabeth Warren is 70, and somehow I’m calling her a “younger” candidate.)</p>
<p>In the end of it all, at this moment my heart is with a Harris/Buttigieg ticket, with them finding some special policy czar spot for Elizabeth Warren. But it’s still a long way until the Iowa Caucuses.</p>
<p>(For the record, my daughter declares her preferred candidates are Warren, Harris, Booker, Biden, and Buttigieg, and that she’s disappointed she isn’t old enough to vote in this election. )</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In reply to a tweet thread the other day, I posed a question that’s been on my mind lately:</p>
<p><em>Update 2023: Twitter account is gone, but the tweet said something like: &ldquo;given that Scripture could be interpreted either way, why <strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong> you want to be an egalitarian?</em></p>
<p>The responses to my tweet asked and presumed that this was a rhetorical question. And while it could sound that way, I didn’t really intend it that way, and I’d like to toss the question around a little bit more. Because I know and love and worship with a bunch of complementarians, and it would be uncharitable and unrealistic to presume that those who hold complementarian views do so for bad reasons.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve given away my own position with the question. I think there’s more than just room for the egalitarian position - I have come to see it as the position that most fully magnifies Christ’s work of reconciliation and restoration.  In addition, fully embracing women serving in any role to which God has gifted them, including leadership roles, brings <a href="/18/05/albert-mohler-the-sbc-and-metoo/">many practical benefits</a> to the church. So if scripturally we could go either way, and the result is beneficial, why wouldn’t we go that route?</p>
<p>I suspect most of my evangelical complementarian friends would start from a different premise. While I would favor a Wesleyan interpretative framework that incorporates reason and experience along with Scripture and tradition, they would lean exclusively on Scripture. Then they would say that the clear position from Scripture is complementarian. And that would basically be that. And while some of the hard line complementarians would elevate it to a gospel-level issue - <a href="http://www.dennyburk.com/why-complementarianism-is-a-gospel-issue/">Denny Burk</a> saying that the “egalitarian hermeneutic has the potential to undermine&hellip; the gospel itself” - most of the complementarians I personally know would acknowledge it as a secondary issue. </p>
<p>I’ve seen enough bad behavior online the past days (weeks, months, years) to believe that there is some subset of complementarians who are by their actions revealing that they are motivated by power and control more than by a particular Scripture hermeneutic. But I think it’s worth saying plainly that I don’t believe that’s common to <em>all</em> complementarians. </p>
<p>I have recently really benefitted from <a href="http://www.themeetinghouse.com/teaching/archives/2019/her-story/">Bruxy Cavey’s teaching</a> on egalitarianism from an Anabaptist perspective. But even further than that I appreciate and want to adopt his attitude that those who disagree with my egalitarian views are still my dearly beloved brothers and sisters in Christ. I just believe they’re wrong on this issue!</p>

			 <p>Trying to not get my book lists get so backed up this time. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been reading recently:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2I9clho"><strong>Golden State</strong></a></em> <strong>by Ben H. Winters</strong><br>
This one underwhelmed me a bit - interesting concept of a society where everything is logged and speaking falsehood is against the law, but execution wasn&rsquo;t so interesting.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2EFMf4I"><strong>Mission Critical</strong></a></em> <strong>by Mark Greaney</strong><br>
Sometimes you just need a spy thriller. But maybe not this spy thriller.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2HLbDbc"><strong>O Pioneers!</strong></a></em> <strong>by Willa Cather</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve never read Cather&rsquo;s novels before, and felt some midwestern hankering for Nebraska-based writing. Now I need to get through the other two in the trilogy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2Z0EPkl"><strong>Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes: Removing Cultural Blinders to Better Understand the Bible</strong></a></em> <strong>by E. Randolph Richards and Brandon J. O&rsquo;Brien</strong><br>
Richards and O&rsquo;Brien are trying to help us understand that some of the texts that we so easily read and interpret through a 21st century American framework can have some significantly different meanings when seen through the cultural framework of the original audience. Worth a read, though not quite as earth-shattering as some of the reviews had led me to believe.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2QAw79s"><strong>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</strong></a></em> <strong>by Rebecca Skloot</strong><br>
Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman whose cells were taken as a medical sample when she was in the hospital for cancer treatment. Those cells proved remarkably resilient and have become the base cell samples for medical experiments around the world to this day. Henrietta&rsquo;s story itself is a rather slim part of the book; it revolves far more around race and poverty and its impact on the family she left behind.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2HMMTQ4"><strong>Talent</strong></a></em> <strong>by Juliet Lapidos</strong><br>
This was a random selection from the library shelf that didn&rsquo;t live up to its blurbs. Claimed to be a &ldquo;deliciously funny&rdquo; novel grappling with the source of creative inspiration and talent. Meh.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2I7tl7L"><strong>This Life or the Next</strong></a></em> <strong>by Demian Vitanza</strong><br>
A novel written as a first-person account of a Pakistani Muslim immigrant to Norway who went to fight with ISIS in Syria. Fiction, but based on accounts given to the author by a man currently serving time in a Norwegian prison for terrorism. Challenging to see an &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; through his own eyes.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2HJqsel"><strong>A Song for Nagasaki: The Story of Takashi Nagai: Scientist, Convert, and Survivor of the Atomic Bomb</strong></a></em> <strong>by Paul Glynn</strong><br>
Biography, faith story, and harrowing account of surviving the Nagasaki atomic bombing all rolled into one. Really enjoyed this book. Planning to pass it along to my high school daughter to read.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2QIbnNf"><strong>The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America&rsquo;s Shining Women</strong></a></em> <strong>by Kate Moore</strong><br>
An account of an early workplace safety issue and court case where young women worked painting radium onto watches to make the faces luminescent. It&rsquo;s an unsurprising story in most ways: a workplace hazard that, once understood by the corporation, was denied and covered up in order to maintain profits. The continual and vivid descriptions of the horrible effects of radium poisoning on these women&rsquo;s bodies may have felt necessary to the author to raise the stakes of the story, but they were <em>so</em> vivid and plentiful that I just about put the book down because I could take any more talk of rotting jawbones and gushing pus.</p>
<p>And just so the last words in my blog post aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;gushing pus&rdquo;, let me note that I&rsquo;m still working on Rebecca West&rsquo;s <em>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</em>. It&rsquo;s just gonna take me a while.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2019/05/14/these-democrats-should.html">These Democrats Should Run for Senate instead of President in 2020</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With today’s announcement by Montana governor Steve Bullock that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/14/676605076/montana-gov-steve-bullock-announces-2020-presidential-run">he is throwing his hat in the ring</a> for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, we now have 23 nationally recognized candidates running.  With the field wide open and a troubled incumbent, this is to an extent understandable. </p>
<p>However, (and I&rsquo;m by no means the first to observe this,) if the Democrats want to make lasting changes to the direction Trump and McConnell have taken the country since 2016, they need not only the White House - they need a Senate majority. So, here’s my run-down of the current presidential candidates and where I think they should be running for Senate instead. (Candidates listed alphabetically, direct from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries">the relevant Wikipedia article</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bennet</strong> - Bennet is currently a Democratic senator from Colorado, and his term doesn’t expire until 2022. He isn’t hurting the Dems’ chances at the Senate by running.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> - While Biden had a long and distinguished career in the Senate, he’s not likely to run again after serving as VP for two terms. And Delaware’s two senators are already Democrats. Joe can stay in.</p>
<p><strong>Cory Booker</strong> - Booker’s Senate term is up in 2020. Somebody’s gonna have to fill that hole. My 10-second Google search didn’t turn up anybody announced yet to run to fill his spot, but New Jersey is a fairly safe state for Democrats, seeing as they keep re-electing even the highly corrupt Bob Menendez. </p>
<p><strong>Steve Bullock</strong> - Bullock is touting his ability to have won statewide office in a majority Republican state as a qualification for his presidential campaign. But Montana has a Republican senator up for re-election in 2020, and if Bullock really has such skills, he should turn them toward defeating Steve Daines to turn the second Montana Senate seat blue.</p>
<p><strong>Pete Buttigieg</strong> - Mayor Pete might be at some point a worthy Democratic Senate candidate from Indiana. However, Indiana doesn’t have a Senate seat up in 2020. Mayor Pete can keep running. He might make somebody a good Vice President.</p>
<p><strong>Julián Castro</strong> - Castro would need to do a little bit of coordinating here with Beto O’Rourke. Both are from Texas, and Texas has a Senate seat up in 2020. O’Rourke almost knocked off Ted Cruz in 2018; Castro could surely put up a strong state-wide campaign if he took up the torch. One of these guys should be challenging John Cornyn next year.</p>
<p><strong>John Delaney</strong> - Who is this guy again? Maryland already has two Democratic senators and neither are up for re-election in 2020. Delaney is welcome to keep tilting at windmills as long as his funding holds out.</p>
<p><strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong> - In pretty much the same spot as Delaney. She’s not going to challenge one of Hawaii’s existing Democratic senators, so why not run for President?</p>
<p><strong>Kirsten Gillibrand</strong> - Gillibrand is already a Senator and just got re-elected in 2018. If she doesn’t take the White House, she’ll stay in the Capitol. No impact.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Gravel</strong> - LOL.</p>
<p><strong>Kamala Harris</strong> - Harris has two years left on her term in the Senate, so she’s safe either way. </p>
<p><strong>John Hickenlooper</strong> - Here’s another guy who should reconsider. Cory Gardner (who I always seem to get confused with Cory Booker for some reason) is up for re-election in 2020. Hickenlooper has been popular as a governor in Colorado. If he could oust Gardner that’d turn another Senate seat blue. It’d be worth a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Inslee</strong> - Inslee is currently Governor of Washington, a state that already has two Democratic senators. No harm in him running.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong> - Klobuchar just won re-election to the Senate in 2018 so she’s safe either way. Fortunately for her it’s almost done snowing in Minnesota for the season, so her campaigning will get a little bit easier.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Messam</strong> - If you’re saying “who is that again?”, a reminder that Messam is currently the mayor of Miramar, Florida. Which, to be fair I guess, is about the same size as South Bend, Indiana. Florida doesn’t have any Senate seats up in 2020, though.</p>
<p><strong>Seth Moulton</strong> - I had to look this guy up to remember who he is. (He’s a member of the House from Massachusetts.) Ed Markey is up for re-election in Massachusetts but surely he’ll run again, so Moulton is left out in the cold.</p>
<p><strong>Beto O’Rourke</strong> - As I wrote above, he’s gotta get w/ Julián Castro and figure out which one of them is gonna take out John Cornyn.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Ryan</strong> - No Senate seats open in Ohio in 2020, so Ryan can be another nondescript white Midwestern guy running for President.</p>
<p><strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> - Bernie just won re-election in 2018. His seat is safe until old age catches up with him.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Swalwell</strong> - Again, who? Another non-descript Midwestern boy (he was born in Iowa, even if he’s currently a Californian) who doesn’t have a Senate seat to run for.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> - Just won re-election in Massachusetts in 2018. </p>
<p><strong>Marianne Williamson</strong> - LOL. (From California. See Swalwell above.)</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Yang</strong> - Also LOL. From New York. Not gonna challenge Schumer or Gillibrand even if they were up in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="so-lets-review">So, let&rsquo;s review.</h3>
<p>Which Democrats should run for Senate instead of President? Bullock in Montana. Castro or O’Rourke in Texas. Hickenlooper in Colorado. Then Stacey Abrams should challenge Perdue in Georgia. </p>
<p>Then we need a strong Democrat to run against Joni Ernst in Iowa, but the Iowa Democrats haven’t managed to field a strong candidate for anything in a while. (<a href="https://www.scholten4iowa.com/">J. D. Scholten</a> might have a better luck running state-wide against Ernst than he did running against Steve King for the House&hellip;)</p>
<p>And can North Carolina get enough voting rights back to unseat Thom Tillis? They get to undo some gerrymanders but that won’t affect a statewide race like the Senate.</p>
<p>In short: there are some opportunities for Democrats to make gains and possibly take an outright majority in the Senate in 2020. But they need to spend their energy running for those seats instead of having all their strong candidates running in a giant knock-out race for President. If 2020 is really about our Republic’s survival after four years of Trump and McConnell destroying all governing norms, Democrats need to treat it that way and make a cooperative concerted effort to win both the White House and the Senate. </p>
<p>At least a guy can dream, right?</p>

<p>I have lived abroad often enough to be conscious of the flaws in various nations’ social democratic systems. But I know too that those systems usually make possible <em>something</em> closer to a just and charitable society than ours has ever been.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
One need not idealize any of these nations or ignore the ways in which they differ in balancing public and private financing of civic services. But all of them are, broadly speaking, places where — without any unsustainable burden on the national economy — the cost of health care per capita is far lower than it is here and yet coverage is universal, where life spans are longer, where working people are not made destitute by serious illnesses, where a choice between food or pharmaceuticals need never be made, where the poor cannot be denied treatments by insurance adjusters, where pre-existing health conditions could never be denied coverage, where most people have far more savings and much lower levels of debt than is the case here, where very few families live only a paycheck away from total poverty, where wages generally keep pace with inflation, where every worker has decent vacation time each year, where suicide and opioid addiction are not the default lifestyle of the working poor, where homelessness is exceedingly rare, where retirement care is humane and comprehensive and where the schools are immeasurably better than ours are.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I really appreciated <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2019/04/heresy-as-therapy.html">this from Richard Beck today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People don&rsquo;t just wake up one day to suddenly and brazenly espouse a heresy. In my experience, you end up a heretic because there&rsquo;s a gnawing theological issue that&rsquo;s keeping you up at night. The burden and size of this issue often grows and grows until a lack of progress in its resolution becomes intellectually and emotionally intolerable&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
<em>&hellip;many people at this point do something very heroic and commendable. They become heretics.</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>It&rsquo;s heroic and commendable because faith isn&rsquo;t being jettisoned. A herculean effort is made to keep and secure faith. Sure, the price is believing in some rather contested, controversial stuff, but the win is keeping you in the orbit of God, the Bible, and the church.</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>All that to say, heresy might be wrong, but it can be awfully therapeutic. The mind settles and the heart calms and you can get on with the real business of following Jesus in your day to day life. Some people just need to believe in weird, quirky stuff to make the puzzle fit together.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beck&rsquo;s reasoning has validity, too, when it comes to beliefs that aren&rsquo;t heresy but that are outside the theological mainstream of whatever community you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Our salvation is blessedly not on the basis of mentally embracing exactly perfect doctrine. I&rsquo;m comfortable, as I think Beck is here, to trust that God knows the hearts and desires of those people seeking Him, and that if He sees it needful to bring my heart around to embrace some belief that I just can&rsquo;t stomach today, He can do that.</p>
<p>As Beck says at the end of his piece, &ldquo;a little bit of empathy, understanding and compassion around these issues would do everyone a great deal of good.&rdquo; Amen.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a long winter. Heck, it&rsquo;s been a long <em>week</em>. Which makes today a particularly happy one: it&rsquo;s opening day for Major League Baseball.

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed baseball since I was a kid, having spent many hours as a teenager listening to the Texas Rangers on the radio. Upon moving to Iowa after college I fell in with a bunch of Chicago Cubs fans and have followed them ever since. We took the kids to Wrigley Field last fall for the first time, and I have some kid-made Cubs fan art hanging in my office that dates back to Game 7 of the 2016 World Series. I won&rsquo;t be free to sit and watch the Opening Day game with them today - darn workday afternoon games! - but I&rsquo;m doing my best to pass a love of the game on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Play ball! Oh, and: Go Cubs, Go!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never been particularly a jewelry or fashion guy. I&rsquo;ve worn a watch inconsistently over the years, usually a cheap digital for running. My wife has made her best attempts a couple times during our 20-some-year relationship to give me nicer watches, and while I did indeed like them, they never really took. Enough dead watch batteries later I finally just gave up and they got relegated to a box in the closet.</p>
<p>A few years ago I got an Apple watch, and then a couple years later an upgraded Apple watch, and while I really liked it for most of what it did, I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling from time to time that the last thing I really needed was an electronic device literally strapped to me.</p>
<p>Sometime this past winter I started reading about mechanical watches. Which led to me putting one on a gift wish list. Which led to my dear and patient wife buying me this for Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is what the watch community calls an &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; watch. A <a href="https://www.jomashop.com/seiko-5-mens-watch-snzg15.html">Seiko 5 Sport</a>, it&rsquo;s fully mechanical - gears, not an electronic quartz-driven mechanism, and automatic, meaning you don&rsquo;t wind it and it has no battery - it stores kinetic energy from moving around while you wear it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worn it most every day for the past six weeks and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it. I can&rsquo;t entirely define why, but there&rsquo;s something inherently enjoyable about having this finely-crafted mechanical device ticking away in the way that timepieces have done for hundreds of years. Now sure, it won&rsquo;t buzz when I get a text message (though my wrist still feels phantom buzzing from time to time&hellip;) or alert me when the Cubs win a baseball game. But it seems like an appropriate level of value vs. distraction; that is to say, it looks good, keeps good time, and otherwise stays out of the way. And while it cost more than a cheap Timex digital, it was still a lot cheaper than the Apple Watch!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done just enough online reading about mechanical watches to understand that they call this one &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; for a reason. I can&rsquo;t quite envision buying <a href="https://www.jomashop.com/omega-watch-215-33-44-21-01-001.html">one that looks a lot the same yet costs the same as a decent used car</a>&hellip; but at this entry level it doesn&rsquo;t feel yet like a too dangerous habit.</p>

			 <p>One of my favorite discoveries as of late has been the new webcomic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nathanwpylestrangeplanet/?hl=en">Strange Planet</a>. Apparently only published via Instagram, artist Nathan W. Pyle explores mundane human activities through the lens of aliens. It&rsquo;s delightful and odd. A characteristic example:</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2019/03/20/democracy-for-republicans.html">Democracy for Republicans</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2019/03/20/democracy-for-republicans.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-20 07:18:16 -0500">Mar 20, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/blog/democracy-for-republicans/">really good essay by Jacob T. Levy (Professor of Political Theory at McGill University) over at the Niskanen Center today</a> in which he argues that the Republican Party needs to renew its commitment to democracy. &ldquo;One sign of seriousness&rdquo; of a post-Trump Republican Party, says Levy, &ldquo;would be a commitment to building a Republican Party that can win free and fair elections, a Republican Party whose strategy rests on appealing to pluralities or majorities and that can embrace more voters rather than fewer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Levy goes on to document how over the past 30 years, both at the federal and state level, Republicans have frequently failed to win a plurality of the popular vote and yet still have held majorities in legislative bodies. The Republican Party, says Levy,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;is now the beneficiary of all the countermajoritarian mechanisms that make it difficult to translate voting pluralities or majorities into electoral wins, including those that were deliberate creations of constitutional design, those that evolved more or less accidentally, and those that were opportunistically engineered in recent decades. It is moreover the beneficiary of actions that selectively suppress voter turnout and eligibility to vote. Democrats more often than not command popular-vote pluralities even though many Democratic-leaning voters are discouraged or prohibited from getting to the ballot box at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levy argues that the longstanding conservative suspicion of majoritarian democracy is based more on the Founders' understanding of classical, zero-sum Roman economic precedents, and that such a system is poorly equipped to handle modern commercial capitalism. And while that conservative suspicion is often justified by an argument that the mob will just vote for socialism to line their own pocketbook (as if the elites aren&rsquo;t also voting for their pocketbooks?), Levy argues that position is unjustified by history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there have been deeply despotic socialist regimes in modernity, these have almost never come about through the domestic subversion of democratic governments; they have been imposed by external military domination or else have replaced domestic oligarchic autocracies of one type or another. The fear of the redistributionist mob exercises a powerful hold on the conservative imagination, and has often served as an excuse for repression and constitutional violation. But we should understand that excuse <em>as an excuse.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/blog/democracy-for-republicans/">long essay and worth reading in its entirety</a>. While I&rsquo;m not personally likely to support most of the Republican Party ideals regardless of their political strategy, I&rsquo;m fully on board w/ Levy&rsquo;s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be good, in other words, to have a competition <em>in the direction of freer, fairer, and more open-access elections,</em> with competing ideas about what that means and what to prioritize. That’s compatible with making an issue out of instances of Democratic misconduct that themselves call for future-oriented, general, rule-governed remedies. But it means <em>not</em> an agenda based on fake panic about nonexistent undocumented-immigrant voting or almost nonexistent voter fraud, not an agenda about dressing up restriction as reform. I am not sure that there are currently any powerful Republicans who are willing to try to take part in those debates, Republicans who are willing to embrace the goal of building a party that can win pluralities and majorities of freer and more open elections. I am sure that it will be a good sign when there are.</p>

			 <p>There are a few big stories rattling around the American evangelical church community lately that I see as being related. I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s a single root cause, but there are some common symptoms and conditions that contribute to them all.</p>
<p>There have been barrels of ink used to write on these issues already. I&rsquo;m primarily thinking about:</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of a broad historical pattern of misogyny within the church.</strong></p>

<li>Read <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore&rsquo;s <em>Letter to My Brothers</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The #ChurchToo movement, recognizing a long pattern of cover up of sexual abuse and assault in the name of protecting church leaders and &ldquo;the church&rsquo;s witness&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2017/09/25/janes-story-leaders-failed/">Jane&rsquo;s story of sexual assault cover-up at The Masters College</a> or about</li>

<p><strong>The disgrace of several multi-site megachurch pastors.</strong></p>

<li>Just this week <a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/02/13/james-macdonald-fired-as-pastor-harvest-bible-chapel-by-church-elders/">James MacDonald was fired by Harvest Bible Chapel</a> after suing journalists who had been investigating abuse coverups at HBC, including <a href="http://julieroys.com/mancow-airs-shocking-comments-james-macdonald-response/">a bizarre recording of MacDonald talking with a Chicago radio host about trying to put illegal porn on the computer of the CEO of Christianity Today</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reeling yet? That&rsquo;s all just within the past five years or so. And there are undoubtedly more revelations to come.</p>
<h3 id="common-threads">Common threads</h3>
<p>A few decades from now I&rsquo;m sure there will be analyses with better perspective on this stuff, but right here in the middle of it I want to suggest two common threads in all of these.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful, unaccountable men.</strong> Whether at the megachurch level or the independent Southern Baptist Church level, men craving power find ways to set up systems that will keep them from accountability. They hand-pick their elder boards. They re-write church bylaws and membership agreements to ensure that they have all the control.</p>
<p><strong>Systemic silencing and ignoring of women</strong> If you haven&rsquo;t read <a href="https://blog.lproof.org/2018/05/a-letter-to-my-brothers.html">Beth Moore&rsquo;s post</a> yet, go read it. She&rsquo;s just one of many, but expresses the issue well. In complementarian churches, women who are themselves fully committed to the idea that they shouldn&rsquo;t be elders or teachers too often find themselves pushed out of <em>any</em> role that smacks of leadership. Tim Challies, no flaming outlier in the neo-Reformed camp, <a href="https://www.challies.com/articles/the-public-reading-of-scripture/">restricts women from publicly reading Scripture in a worship service</a>. John Piper says that <a href="https://relevantmagazine.com/god/john-piper-thinking-women-probably-shouldnt-police-officers-reveals-flaws-gender-theology/">women shouldn&rsquo;t be police officers because they ought not to be &ldquo;giving directives&rdquo; to men</a>. I could go on.</p>
<h3 id="practical-steps-going-forward">Practical steps going forward</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to lament. <em>Real repentance includes taking real steps toward change</em>.</p>
<p>When the doctor tells you that you&rsquo;ve got heart failure and high blood pressure and are going to die very prematurely if you don&rsquo;t make some changes, you don&rsquo;t just say &ldquo;thanks, doc&rdquo; and then keep your old lifestyle. You re-evaluate your priorities. Sure, you believed strongly in desserts and cheeseburgers and lots of Netflix time. But if you want to be healthy, you may find that a belief in vegetables and desserts in moderation and regular exercise are also acceptable life choices and will allow you to flourish in a way you wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise.</p>
<p>Similarly, the evangelical church needs to look at its &ldquo;life choices&rdquo; and tightly-held doctrinal distinctives and the fruit that has resulted and make decisions accordingly. How serious are we about repentance?</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong> Pastors and leaders need real, tangible accountability. For denominations that are structured with congregational autonomy, there should be elder boards that can call pastors on the carpet when need be. <em>We need to take the qualifications for eldership seriously</em>. Not argumentative? Not greedy? Heck, we need to take the fruit of the Spirit seriously. Peace? Patience? Kindness? Self-control? A lot of this stuff is obvious and just needs to be followed.</p>
<p>Additionally, stronger denominational oversight, even an accountability hierarchy, may be appropriate. It&rsquo;s not a silver bullet - the Roman Catholic church is the largest religious bureaucracy in the world and has its own accountability issues - but something needs to be done. If congregational autonomy is so important that it precludes churches from reporting and protecting other churches from known sex offenders, congregational autonomy is an idol that should be done away with.</p>
<p><strong>Bigger is not better</strong> Can we all just agree at this point that big multi-site churches with charismatic preachers streaming in over video are a really, really bad idea? How many more Driscolls and MacDonalds do we need to build and then destroy these empires before we&rsquo;re willing to acknowledge that this model is unhealthy, produces unhealthy churches, and causes serious hurt to thousands of believers who were a part of those churches? Give me an army of Eugene Petersons ministering in little neighborhood churches rather than a Mark Driscoll or James MacDonald or (dare I even say it) Matt Chandler projected larger than life on a video screen at campuses across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to women and believe their testimony</strong> When women and young people come forward with allegations of abuse, we must take them seriously. We must have good processes and training in place at our churches to make sure that children and young people are protected. And we need to be willing to expose abuse if it happens, and learn from it, and improve. This is non-negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>Bring women into leadership</strong> It seems obvious that if women were included in the leadership of these churches, and if they were listened to and had power such that they could take action, we would not have the systemic ongoing issues with abuse that we have today. (Again, not a silver bullet - Willow Creek has women in leadership - but still&hellip;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to add another thousand words to this post to stake out a position on complementarianism vs. egalitarianism. (OK, so I want to, but that&rsquo;s another post.) But even pragmatically, if people like <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2014/06/12/ordination-of-women-nt-wright/">Scot McKnight</a> and <a href="http://ntwrightpage.com/2016/07/12/womens-service-in-the-church-the-biblical-basis/">N. T. Wright</a> - neither of whom can reasonably be accused of being wild-eyed progressives - can find a Scriptural basis for women being ordained into ministry leadership, <em>it&rsquo;s not unreasonable to ask whether complementarianism is a second- or third-level doctrine that deserves another look.</em></p>
<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
<p>Repentance requires action. Repentance for particularly painful, systemic sin probably requires painful, systemic action. Whether the evangelical church in America will be willing to broadly repent remains to be seen. I pray that it will, and commit to doing what I can in my own congregation to act out that repentance.</p>

<p><em>Justice is inherent in justification.</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
This understanding of justification will have enormous effects on the church&rsquo;s understanding of mission. Like Paul, the church that lives by this account of justification will not merely be trying to &ldquo;save souls&rdquo; but will want to be God&rsquo;s agent in the creation of a justified and just people - transformed and participating in Christ and his current work in and through the church.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Evangelism - sharing the good news - will be a message about liberation from all sorts of sin, including hatred and violence and injustice, and into a new life. Centrifugal activity, or outreach - embodying the good news in the public square - will mean siding with those who are neglected and mistreated, whether in the neighborhood or in another part of the world. In fact, the differences between terms like &ldquo;evangelism&rdquo; and &ldquo;outreach&rdquo; will in part collapse, not because Jesus is being replaced with justice, understood in some generic, secular way, but because Jesus is justice, the justice of God incarnate. The result will be a <em>deeper</em> spirituality, not a lesser one, a closer walk with God (the God of justice), not a more distant one. In fact, the result will be a passion for Jesus <em>and</em> for justice.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Time for a quick recap of my 2018 reading. I&rsquo;ve done several reading posts through the year so this can just be a summary.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=2018-reads">Goodreads</a> I can report I read 71 books in 2018. 33 of those were fiction, the remaining 38 were mostly history and theology, with a few biographies thrown in. Though I have a large virtual stack of unread books in my Kindle app, most of my reading this year was still dead tree books. (Maybe this year I can start plowing through the electronic ones&hellip;)</p>
<p>A few notable favorites for the year:</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RRMm4Y">Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hell, Hope, and the New Jerusalem</a></em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2RRMm4Y">by Bradley Jersak</a></strong><br>
Meeting Brad Jersak and hearing him teach this past summer at the Water to Wine Gathering was a highlight of my year. In this book Brad sketches a truly hopeful view of final things, of an eternal city whose gates are always open and inviting. I need to go re-read this one.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2FskPBl">The Cross and the Lynching Tree</a></em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2FskPBl">by James H. Cone</a></strong><br>
I&rsquo;m sure I wasn&rsquo;t ready to read this one when it was published back in 2011. But to pick it up in late 2018 and read Dr. Cone&rsquo;s insightful parallels between the cross on which Jesus suffered and the trees on which so many black people were lynched throughout American history was a powerful thing. I was struct by how the Bible is adaptable and interpretable (a more palatable word to some might be &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;) to such diverse swaths of the human experience.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2RJLTSv">The Calculating Stars</a></em> <a href="https://amzn.to/2RJLTSv">by Mary Robinette Kowal</a></strong><br>
This one is a sort of alt-history crossed with <em>Hidden Figures</em> written from a strongly feminist viewpoint. Loved it. Next to pass it on to my daughters.</p>
<h4 id="they-werent-all-awesome">They weren&rsquo;t all awesome.</h4>
<p>Generally if I start in and after 40-50 pages I&rsquo;m significantly unimpressed, I just put the book back on the return-to-library pile and pick up another one. Life&rsquo;s too short to stick it out through bad books. There were a few clunkers, though, that I did manage to get all the way through and wouldn&rsquo;t recommend. Two that stick out are <em>Street Freaks</em> by Terry Brooks (sci-fi writer trying cyber-punk and abusing every cliche in the genre) and <em>The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</em> by Catherine Nixey, which <a href="/18/05/finished-reading-2018-part-three/">I wrote about earlier</a>.</p>
<h4 id="on-to-2019">On to 2019!</h4>
<p>I started the year thinking that I needed to burn through my Kindle and purchased book backlog. Then a week later I went to the library and borrwed four more books. Maybe I have a problem&hellip; but I guess it&rsquo;s a good sort of problem to have.</p>

<p>If you are entrusted with a certain gift, most of the people around you won’t be similarly gifted. They won’t be able to see as clearly because God has not equipped them to. But being gifted with discernment does not give you permission to be spiteful, arrogant, or judgmental toward them. It is your responsibility to help the community by raising uncomfortable questions and then waiting patiently while it struggles with them. And more than likely, you’ll have to wait much longer than you want.</p>

			 <p>I went down a little bit of a YouTube rat hole the other day watching a playlist full of videos where musician fans of big artists get pulled up on stage to play with the band. It started here:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1074361409012621313">twitter.com/CaseyNewt&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Which in the replies led me to this playlist:</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/k08gH2BJUXs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Some of them are a little too obviously pre-planned - the 11-year-old who magically ends up on stage with Carrie Underwood has her own YouTube channel with 30,000 followers - but most of them are genuinely delightful.</p>
<p>For instance, this one where a teenager joins Bruce Springsteen on stage to sing &ldquo;Growin' Up&rdquo;:</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xY3q45EBt8' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Or the college kid here who boldly asks Billy Joel to sing &ldquo;New York State of Mind&rdquo; while the kid plays the piano, and proceeds to win Joel&rsquo;s grudging respect:</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/htZnpnoHGgY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>But hands down, the winner in these has to be anybody singing the &ldquo;For Good&rdquo; duet with Kristen Chenowith. There must be a dozen of these on YouTube. And why not? It&rsquo;s a beautiful song, just challenging enough to let a good vocalist shine, some nice harmonies. And Chenowith is a generous performer, encouraging her amateur counterparts, guiding them along through the song, and seeming to genuinely enjoy the experience. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxKjiJ2qwtU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>I think I love these so much because you see momentary flashes of the true joy of making music together, and you get reminded that while a lucky (and very talented) few make it big, there are talented musicians everywhere who could, on a given night, step in and hold their own with their favorite band.</p>
<p>As a musician myself you can bet I&rsquo;ve had idle daydreams where I was in this sort of scenario myself. But even though I&rsquo;d give my eye teeth to do the Behold the Lamb of God Christmas show with Andrew Peterson and gang, it always seems uncharitable to wish that Ben Shive would break his hand and need an impromptu replacement. (But if he ever does, Andrew, give me a call, eh?)</p>

			 <p>Having read very few black theologians over my past couple decades of reading theology, it was far past time for me to get to the late <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Cone">Dr. James H. Cone</a>’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2QYGcQg"><em>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</em></a>. Dr. Cone, a longtime proponent of black liberation theology, makes a forceful case for the parallel between the cross of Jesus Christ and the hanging trees on which so many black people were lynched throughout American history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until we can see the cross and the lynching tree together, until we can identify Christ with a “recrucified” black body hanging from a lynching tree, there can be no genuine understanding of Christian identity in America, and no deliverance from the brutal legacy of slavery and white supremacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book came with great reviews and reputation, so I was a little bit underwhelmed by the first few chapters. But then came chapter 4, “The Recrucified Christ in Black Literary Imagination”, and Cone introduces us to the vivid poetic imagery that black writers have used to parallel Jesus’ suffering with those of black Americans, and I found myself heading off to the internet to better acquaint myself with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countee_Cullen">Countee Cullen</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hayden">Robert Hayden</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes">Langston Hughes</a>.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter, though, was worth the entire book. Dr. Cone shares his own experience and then explains his beautiful theological conclusions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Christian gospel is God’s message of liberation in an unredeemed and tortured world. As such, it is a transcendent reality that lifts our spirits to a world far removed from the suffering of this one&hellip;<br>
&hellip;And yet the Christian gospel is more than a transcendent reality, more than “going to heaven when I die, to shout salvation as I fly”. It is also an immanent reality - a powerful liberating presence among the poor right <em>now</em> in their midst&hellip; Without concrete signs of divine presence in the lives of the poor, the gospel becomes simply an opiate; rather than liberating the powerless from humiliation and suffering, the gospel becomes a drug that helps them adjust to this world by looking for “pie in the sky”.<br>
And so the transcendent and the immanent, heaven and earth, must be held together in critical, dialectical tension, each one correcting the limits of the other. The gospel is in the world, but it is not <em>of</em> the world; that is, it can be seen in the black freedom movement, but it is much more than what we see in our struggles for justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could quote the whole last chapter but I won’t. It’s really worth picking the book up to read the whole thing.</p>
<p>Or maybe just one last paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I see it, the lynching tree frees the cross from the false pieties of well-meaning Christians. When we see the crucifixion as a first-century lynching, we are confronted by the re-enactment of Christ’s suffering in the blood-soaked history of African Americans. Thus, the lynching tree reveals the true religious meaning of the cross for American Christians today&hellip;<br>
Yet the lynching tree also needs the cross, without which it becomes simply an abomination. It is the cross that points in the direction of hope, the confidence that there is a dimension to life beyond the reach of the oppressor. “Do not fear those who kill the body’s, and after that can do nothing more” (Lk 12:4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply wonderful.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing music in church since high school and as a member of worship bands at least since college, and have played most all the instruments on the team save for electric guitar, but yesterday was a new one for me: I&rsquo;ve never had this view before for a full worship service.</p>

<p>The worship team was short a drummer for the week; with the middle daughter now taking drum lessons I have an electronic kit at home that I can practice on.</p>
<p>It was really a lot of fun. My goal was to practice enough that I didn&rsquo;t embarrass myself, and I think I managed that. To be fair, the songs were relatively easy. Still, I hope they let me do it again sometime.</p>

			 <p>Oh man, I really appreciated <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/escaping-wilderness-changed-theological-positions">this summary from Chaplain Mike</a> over at InternetMonk.com today. While my path isn&rsquo;t exactly the same as his has been, I resonate strongly with several of the moves he describes. He summarizes his move from the left-hand column to the right-hand column in a little table:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/two-theological-columns.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading Mike&rsquo;s little summaries of each of those movements, but I found his concluding thoughts particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is what hit me earlier this week. The differences can be summed up in two letters. “J” and “P”. You may recognize them as the final letters in the Myers Briggs personality type indicator. While Myers Briggs has been somewhat discounted, it got me wondering. Have my theological choices been largely been a product of my personality or personal preferences? Is it just coincidence that many denominations are largely in one column or the other?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Then Wednesday’s Post came along with this humdinger.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Haidt (along with Richard Beck) have convinced me that when we take a stand for “truth” or “morality,” we are primarily revealing deep, fundamental visceral and emotional feelings and then using rational arguments to justify our “righteous” position. Furthermore, those who are on the more “liberal” end of the spectrum react intuitively to different things than those on the “conservative” end. (Chaplain Mike)
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
[I]t makes me wonder if most of my reasons for the theological changes I have made are because of the way I am wired. If I had been wired differently maybe I would have been quite happy to stay in the church of my youth. Conversely, perhaps those who are raised in traditions like the one I am currently in, and who crave certainty in their innermost being end up in those churches that promise more of that. And perhaps there are those who find they do not fit, and chose to chuck the whole church thing altogether.</p>

<p>Lots for me to consider there.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/11/10/a-night-with.html">A night with Bruce Hornsby’s brain</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/11/10/a-night-with.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-10 20:46:14 -0500">Nov 10, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last Friday night my wife and I had the opportunity to go hear Bruce Hornsby play a solo show at the Paramount Theater in Cedar Rapids. Hornsby is an interesting character - a fantastically talented pianist who has made his fame and fortune in rock and jam band genres, but who has made multiple bluegrass records with Ricky Skaggs and drops classical music into the middle of pop tunes.</p>
<p>When I first heard Hornsby&rsquo;s stuff probably 10 years ago, I quickly recognized that my own piano styles and harmonizations aren&rsquo;t too far away from what he plays&hellip; to the point that it was almost uncanny. So the chance to see him play in person was not one I was going to pass up.</p>
<p>Hornsby&rsquo;s current tour is just him with a microphone and a piano (a Steinway concert grand), but with those two tools he commanded the stage for just over two hours. He set the tone by starting the concert with his biggest hit, &ldquo;The Way it Is&rdquo;, into which he dropped a long improvisatory section, morphed it into a couple minutes of a Bach something-or-other, and then morphed it back into the close of the song. Later on in a jam section he dropped in an <em>avant garde</em> &lsquo;perpetual motion&rsquo; piece by American composer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Carter">Elliott Carter</a>. Even if he did spend the majority of his years with The Grateful Dead, the dude has serious piano chops.</p>
<p>When we got to our seats on the right-hand side of the theater, my wife lamented that we should&rsquo;ve gotten seats on the other side so she could see his hands as he played. And I get the fascination with seeing those fingers fly over the keys. But for me the fascination was entirely a mental one.</p>
<p>To sit in the auditorium and engage with Hornsby&rsquo;s brain as he improvised long sections was an amazing experience. I&rsquo;m not a jazz player, but I hear and read jazz players talk about listening to and interacting with other jazz players, and after this Hornsby concert I finally think I understand what they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>When you really understand the playing technique, the harmonies, the nuts and bolts of the music, then you can start to engage at a deeper level - the progressions, the expression, the choice to go around again or branch off somewhere new&hellip; it&rsquo;s really quite a head trip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see Hornsby play again - preferably with a band next time, to experience all of those interactions. Playing good music in a talented group is a intellectually pleasurable exercise for me almost as much as a musical exercise. Sitting in the audience last weekend wasn&rsquo;t as good as being in the band, but it got pretty close.</p>

			 <p>Really <a href="http://www.thomasmckenzie.com/blog/living-as-a-christian-in-our-divided-nation">good piece from Father Thomas McKenzie</a> yesterday about living as a Christian in these divided American times. This bit is worth it alone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Have your political opinions.</strong> Seriously, you have the right to your opinions. You also have the right to voice them. Remember that other people have the same right. <strong>Challenge your own opinion.</strong> Where does your opinion match up with Scripture or the teachings of the Church. How does Jesus inform your opinion? Be humble enough to change your mind to match your faith. <strong>Because someone has a different opinion, they are not your enemy.</strong> They aren’t stupid, heartless, or evil. They are likely a normal person, a sinner, just like you. They may well be someone who loves Jesus, someone you’ll live with forever in Heaven. Treat them as you would like to be treated, remembering Jesus words to “love your neighbor as you love yourself,” and “do to others as you would have them do to you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His call for us to be Christians first, striving for healing and peace above all else, is a challenge to me. Worth reading the whole thing.</p>

			 <p>Social media exhausted me again.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m more self-reflective I guess I have to say I exhausted myself on social media again.</p>
<p>Back a year ago in November I did a <a href="/17/11/a-social-media-fast/">social media fast</a>. For two months I was off Facebook and Twitter altogether. When I came back to it I pared back my Twitter follows, from ~600 to ~300.</p>
<p>In March, after the latest Facebook privacy mess, I decided it was <a href="/18/03/farewell-facebook/">time to be done with Facebook</a>. And so I deactivated my Facebook account.</p>
<p>But over the last few months I&rsquo;ve let them sneak back up on me.</p>
<p>I had the best intentions - my church&rsquo;s online community (mid-week announcements, reminders, prayer requests, etc) are all on a closed Facebook group. I also enjoy the Christ and Pop Culture Facebook group. But it turns out I don&rsquo;t really enjoy Facebook that much, and if I have it on my phone it keeps sucking me in.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Twitter I&rsquo;m more attached to. I have friends that I&rsquo;ve made and kept in contact with almost exclusively on social media, and I keep thinking how much I don&rsquo;t want to lose track of them. But then <a href="http://gfmorris.net/">Geof</a> deleted his Twitter account, and <a href="http://stephen.granades.com/">Stephen</a> and <a href="http://misty.granades.com/">Misty</a> are rarely on it anymore, and <a href="https://twitter.com/danielsdeboer">Dan</a> much more rarely, and <a href="https://twitter.com/crazybutable">John</a> almost never. I feel there&rsquo;s an opportunity here to still have interaction with online and distant friends&hellip; but we&rsquo;ve apparently all decided as a group that Facebook and Twitter aren&rsquo;t the right thing for it anymore. (If you guys are all running some Friends and Family Slack group and you haven&rsquo;t invited me&hellip;)</p>
<p>I still do find some value on Twitter, but I&rsquo;ve gotta cut my follows hard again. The Kavanaugh thing sucked me in again to where politics attained an outsized priority compared to everything else. I know better&hellip; but wow it sucks me in.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s to less frenzy on social media, and more focus on things that matter (acknowledging that some of those things might actually still happen <em>on</em> social media!). Maybe I&rsquo;ll do some more blogging. And if we need to resurrect a phpBB forum or something to interact with distant friends, maybe let&rsquo;s do that, eh?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m reading Matthew W. Bates' <em>Salvation By Allegiance Alone</em> this week, in which he argues that the word the Apostle Paul uses that is usually translated &ldquo;faith&rdquo; (<em>pistis</em> in the Greek) is better understood as &ldquo;allegiance&rdquo; in relationship to salvation. It&rsquo;s an interesting way to look at things.</p>
<p>Bates argues that the essential proclamation of the Gospel in the NT doesn&rsquo;t culminate in Jesus' death and resurrection but rather continues to his ascension and reign as king and lord. He outlines it in eight points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus the king</p>
<ol>
<li>Preexisted with the Father,</li>
<li>Took on human flesh, fulfilling God&rsquo;s promises to David,</li>
<li>Died for sins in accordance with the scriptures,</li>
<li>Was buried,</li>
<li>Was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,</li>
<li>Appeared to many,</li>
<li>Is seated at the right hand of God as Lord, and</li>
<li>Will come again as judge.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty well in line with NT Wright, not an uncommon take. Bates then outlines three &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; of allegiance that he contends are components of salvific allegiance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intellectual agreement - basic assent that those eight components of the Gospel are true statements;</li>
<li>Confession of Loyalty - leaning heavily on Romans 10:9-10 here</li>
<li>Embodied fidelity - what he describes as &ldquo;practical fidelity&rdquo; to Jesus as Lord, referencing heavily to Matthew 7 and the &ldquo;not everyone who says to me &lsquo;Lord, Lord&rsquo;&rdquo; text.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this appears to be hugely controversial at this point, but the reframing is helpful to me to get my head around how we might articulate salvation by grace through faith and yet still say that faith without works is dead.</p>
<p>More to come, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Intersectionality&rdquo; is a concept that has been a popular punching bag of many conservatives, including evangelical Christian ones, in the past year or two. But today, in the midst of <a href="https://americanvision.org/16796/response-to-the-statement-on-social-justice-and-the-gospel/">a post</a> responding to John MacArthur and co&rsquo;s <a href="https://statementonsocialjustice.com/">statement on social justice</a>, Dr. Joel McDurmon provides an example of the principles of intersectionality right out of the book of Acts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, “intersectionality” in its most general form refers to how different classes of people in society experience power or the lack of it differently, and how belonging to multiple classes can compound that one way or another. That may lead to all kinds of Marxist claptrap about class warfare, etc., but it is not an illegitimate idea altogether. If you were a helpless widow in first century Israel, you would not have judged it illegitimate at all. If you crossed multiple social classes and were, for example, a <em>Greek-speaking</em> widow in the first century church, you may have been the first to recognize you were being overlooked, neglected, left out, and you may have complained about it <em>in those terms</em>. This is exactly what happened (Acts 6:1–7). When faced with just such an example of intersectionality in the early church, the Apostles went the extra mile to make sure the marginalized group was cared for. The church met this intersectional social concern directly and ordained six <em>Greek­-named</em> deacons to serve the Greek speaking widows among their Hebrew society.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>My reading has apparently slowed down a bit this summer. Still, there&rsquo;s been some good stuff recently:</p>
<p>Well, first an intro to the first two books. I heard Brad Jersak speak at the Water to Wine Gathering back in June - what a treat. Brad is a Canadian pastor and author, more recent convert to Orthodoxy, and spent many years in pastoral ministry working with the mentally challenged and the poor. He&rsquo;s funny, wise, and kind&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll pick up whatever book he writes next.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2PHXUmx"><em>A More Christlike God: A More Beautiful Gospel</em> by Bradley Jersak</a></strong> If Christ is the truest expression of what God is like, what does that really mean? How should we then think about God? Jersak is no fan of the &ldquo;loving Son protects us from the wrath of the angry Father&rdquo; picture, and instead works through what it looks like to think that Jesus is what God the Father is like.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2M3XF2V"><em>Her Gates Will Never Be Shut: Hell, Hope, and the New Jerusalem</em> by Bradley Jersak</a></strong> Here Jersak takes a careful look at the Biblical texts about heaven and hell and judgment. While it seems he can&rsquo;t quite bring himself to become a universalist, he makes a strong case for the potential that heaven will be much fuller, and hell much emptier, than my traditional evangelical upbringing taught me to expect. And I like the hopeful view. If there&rsquo;s a reasonable case for being hopeful, why not be hopeful?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2NT6eQ5"><em>Ninefox Gambit</em> by Yoon Ha Lee</a></strong> Hugo-winning sci-fi to change things up. A decent story, nothing amazing but entertaining enough.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2NRMUCK"><em>Adjustment Day</em> by Chuck Palahniuk</a></strong> I picked this one off the library shelf on a whim and ended up not really liking it that much. Brutal, pessimistic, dark&hellip; No time for that nonsense.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2NhDC63"><em>Salt: A World History</em> by Mark Kurlansky</a></strong> Kurlansky tracks the usage of salt through history. The book is more interesting when it focuses on ancient times, and progressively less interesting as it reaches the modern day. Also there were far more recipes for salting foods included than I will really ever need.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2NrI9TC"><em>The Fire Next Time</em> by James Baldwin</a></strong> A classic from Baldwin, and the first I&rsquo;ve read of him. What a writer! Beautifully written with a powerful message.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2MPjsRg"><em>The Crimson Petal and the White</em> by Michel Faber</a></strong> Picked this one up after <a href="https://twitter.com/johnthelutheran">@johnthelutheran</a> raved about it. I&rsquo;d previously read Faber&rsquo;s <em>Book of Strange New Things</em> and enjoyed it. <em>The Crimson Petal and the White</em> was something completely different - a Victorian novel that reminded me a good bit of Dickens - but it kept me interested all the way through.</p>

			 <p>Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart takes a break from theology to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dbhartwriter/posts/1094016380751517">talk briefly about his political views</a>; he is, he reveals, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.</p>
<p>His rant on socialism and the popular American distaste for it is too good to not share (though rather long):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that in America, alone among nations with developed economies, the word “socialism” has a sinister ring in many ears. I take this as a symptom of our unique national genius for stupidity. I am well aware of how badly the various parts of a “socialized” economy can at times be managed (the tales I could tell of my experiences with the NHS); but, well managed, they make for a far more humane governing philosophy than ours, and one that comes as close to something like “Distributist” justice in the use of property and wealth as we can hope for under current circumstances. So I find it very odd that, when we look at those nations of northern and western Europe that enjoy the benefits of sane socialist policies, as a result of both their Social Democratic and their Christian Democratic traditions—nations, like Germany or Denmark or France, where the cost of healthcare per capita is far lower and yet coverage is universal, where life spans are longer, where working people are not rendered bankrupt by serious illnesses, where the children of the poor cannot be denied expensive treatments by predatory insurance adjusters, where people have far more savings in bank and endure much lower levels of debt, where wages generally keep pace with inflation, where every worker has decent vacation time each year, where suicide and opioid addiction are not the default lifestyle of the working poor, where homelessness has been nearly abolished, where retirement care is humane and comprehensive, where schools are immeasurably better, where literacy is far higher…—we recoil in horror and thank God that we are free from such things. Surely, we tell ourselves, these are curses, only a few steps away from the gulags. We know that civic wealth is not meant for civic welfare, but is supposed to be diverted into the pockets of the military-industrial complex, by the needless purchase each year of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons systems that will never be used, or is supposed to be squandered through unneeded tax cuts for the very richest of the investment class. We know that when the child of a working family is diagnosed with cancer, that the child should be denied the most expensive treatments, even if they alone can possibly save him or her, and then should probably die, and that his or her family should be utterly impoverished in the process. We call this, I believe, being free. And, as long as we have access to all the guns we could ever need to fight off invasions from Venus, what more can we ask?</p>

			 <p>Former <em>Christianity Today</em> editor Katelyn Beaty has <a href="https://religionnews.com/2018/08/10/beaty-oped/">a great op-ed over on RNS</a> making the case that the #ChurchToo scandal isn&rsquo;t as much a case of <em>sex</em> abuse as it is a case of <em>power</em> abuse. And while the church has spent a lot of time talking about the proper boundaries and exercise of sex, it has spent almost no time talking about the proper boundaries and exercise of power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If money, sex and power are the unholy trinity of spiritual temptation, arguably most Christians have a relatively paltry understanding of the third. Churches teach regular tithing and Dave Ramsey-style financial management. Scads of books and articles are written every year helping Christians practice sexual purity before marriage and sexual fulfillment within it. By contrast, little is taught and written about power and its corrosive effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beaty goes on to suggest three actions for the church if we want to avoid continued scandals like the one with Bill Hybels at Willow Creek. She hits the nail right on the head with the first one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Churches must seek leaders who are accountable and vulnerable, not just charismatic and driven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hybels and Willow Creek have taught the evangelical church culture a lot of lessons over the past two decades about church growth and the megachurch model. Now maybe it&rsquo;s time to start un-learning those lessons. Beaty has some good ideas on where to start.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on work travel this week, visiting Cologne, Germany. It&rsquo;s my second visit to Cologne, which is a lovely European city. Random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jet lag is a weird thing. I&rsquo;ve slept solidly the past two nights here in Germany but I&rsquo;m still dog tired mid-morning and late afternoon. Coffee is only marginally helpful.</li>
<li>One thing I love about Cologne is the number of bakeries with fresh bread and rolls easily available. A croissant and coffee for breakfast is just my speed.</li>
<li>18 people in my meeting today and only 4 women. Which, sadly, is still better representation than our industry overall. We should do better.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m astonished by the number of people out and about to very late hours. 10 pm and it&rsquo;s just twilight, restaurants all still going strong, lots of people hanging out along the river.</li>
<li>Trips to Europe turn into opportunities to do two workdays - just as the workday here is ending, the one back home is cranking up. Lots of stuff popping back at the home office this week.</li>
<li>I wish they did air conditioning better over here. It&rsquo;s HOT.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Economy Comfort +&rdquo; on an old Boeing 767-400 is kind of a joke. It&rsquo;s still expensive and isn&rsquo;t really comfortable.</li>
<li>They have an abundance of beer house restaurants over here that are remarkably the same - get your choice of bratwurst, wiener schnitzel, or schwein haxe (pork knuckle) with potatoes and sauerkraut. They only serve one kind of beer, the house brand. It&rsquo;d be kinda like choosing between the Budweiser Restaurant, the Miller Restaurant, and the Coors Restaurant, all of which served similar burgers and fries.</li>
<li>So much beer, not enough water.</li>
<li>That all being said, it&rsquo;s kinda fun to order 1/2 meter of bratwurst at the restaurant.</li>
<li>I just realized last night that I misplaced a meeting on my calendar for the fall, and since my wife has already scheduled around it, I&rsquo;ll probably just need to miss the meeting. Oops.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if I could keep that trip I might just make it to gold status with Delta for the first time. Two international trips this year and a bunch of domestic travel&hellip;</li>
<li>Oof I&rsquo;m tired. Where&rsquo;s the coffee?</li>

Its absurdly engorged military budget diverts hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the public weal to those who profit from the military-industrial complex. Its plutocratic policies and libertarian ethos are immune to all appeals of human solidarity. It towers over the world, but promises secure shelter only to the fortunate few.&rdquo; &ndash;David Bentley Hart, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/opinion/new-york-yankees-evil.html">&ldquo;The New York Yankees Are a Moral Abomination&rdquo;</a></p>

			 <p>I attended the Water to Wine Gathering at Word of Life Church in St. Joseph, MO a couple weekends ago. WOLC&rsquo;s pastor Brian Zahnd included in one of his talks some discussion of the dangers of biblicism. I had hoped to summarize that talk in a blog post, but happily <a href="https://brianzahnd.com/2018/07/christianity-vs-biblicism/">Zahnd has published a post of his own doing just that</a>. (It&rsquo;s actually the preface to an upcoming book, but he shared it on his blog.) I find his thinking very helpful in how we approach and interpret the Bible.</p>
<p>I particularly enjoy his opening metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As modern Christians we are children of a broken home. Five centuries ago the Western church went through a bitter divorce that divided European Christians and their heirs into estranged Catholic and Protestant families. The reality that the Renaissance church was in desperate need of reformation doesn’t change the fact that along with a reformation there also came an ugly split that divided the church’s children between a Catholic mother and a Protestant father. In the divorce settlement (to push the metaphor a bit further) Catholic Mom got a long history, a rich tradition, and a unified church, but all Protestant Dad got was the Bible. Without history, tradition, or a magisterium, the Bible had to be everything for Protestant Dad — and Protestants have made the most of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to liken the Bible to rich soil out of which grows the tree that is the Christian faith. The Christian faith is rooted in and draws nourishment from the Bible, but Christianity and the Bible are not synonymous. To approach it this way, says Zahnd,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;is both conservative and progressive. Conservative in that it recognizes the inviolability of Scripture. Progressive in that it makes a vital distinction between the living faith and the historic text.</p>

<p>I probably have some readers getting very nervous at this point, but if so I would really recommend reading <a href="https://brianzahnd.com/2018/07/christianity-vs-biblicism/">the whole thing</a>. Zahnd and others like him are pointing the way to embrace Scripture while at the same time moving past reading it in a flat, biblicistic way.</p>

			 <p>What I&rsquo;ve read the past month or so:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2L0hl89"><em>Head On</em> by John Scalzi</a></strong> A sequel in Scalzi&rsquo;s series from the near future where some humans are afflicted by a disease that causes &ldquo;lock in&rdquo;, where their bodies are vegetative but their minds are able to interact with the outside world via a neural interface and proxy robot-like bodies. An entertaining read.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2J5iOIB"><em>The Seven Mountains of Thomas Merton</em> by Michael Mott</a></strong> Interesting to read a biography of Merton written by someone other than himself. (While <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em> is well worth a read, it&rsquo;s clearly pretty one-sided.) Merton remains a fascinating character to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2ukhU5R"><em>Finding Darwin&rsquo;s God: A Scientist&rsquo;s Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution</em> by Kenneth Miller</a></strong> I found Miller&rsquo;s name when looking at biology textbooks - he&rsquo;s the author of a very popular one used by our public high school. Turns out he&rsquo;s a professing Christian who has spent a bunch of time thinking and writing about how he makes sense of his faith in light of his life-long study of evolution. I found the book thoughtful and very reasonable. Worth a read.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2J8Rt8n"><em>On Reading Well: Finding the Good Life Through Great Books</em> by Karen Swallow Prior</a></strong> This one isn&rsquo;t out yet, but I snagged a review copy and will write a full post later. Prior uses each chapter in this book to highlight a virtue and a great book that illustrates the virtue. I now have a bunch more books on my list that I&rsquo;ve somehow failed to read thus far.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2u6TpK6"><em>How Right You Are, Jeeves</em> by P.G. Wodehouse</a></strong> Light-hearted fluff&hellip; perfect for reading on vacation next to a swimming pool&hellip; which was exactly what I did.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2zqYH8k"><em>Warning Light</em> by David Ricciardi</a></strong> Highly forgettable spy thriller. Something about a guy who may or may not have been spying on an Iranian nuclear site and then is trying to escape. Yawn.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2m6dOKK"><em>The Patient Ferment of the Early Church: The Improbable Rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire</em> by Alan Kreider</a></strong> Now <em>this</em> was a good one. Kreider was a Professor of Church History at Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana. He spends most of this volume examining primary sources from the first few centuries A.D. (basically 1st century up through Constantine) and looking at what those Christians viewed as important. Notably important: patience and longsuffering. It becomes clear reading Kreider how much the tenor of the early church changed when Constantine brought them out of the</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2u6TH3L"><em>Bed and Board: Plain Talk About Marriage</em> by Robert Farrar Capon</a></strong> This one was in urban legend status for a while - an old, out-of-print title from a beloved (if somewhat niche) author that supposedly was very good. And hey, it got reprinted, and it&rsquo;s not even that expensive! Capon is his familiar crusty self, and honestly the chapters on marriage fell a little short in my mind. But the chapter on Things and our approach to them was golden. Completely worth the price of the book. Merits a blog post later.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2m1Hgl8"><em>Eisenhower vs. Warren: The Battle for Civil Rights and Liberties</em> by James F. Simon</a></strong> A nice overview of Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren and President Dwight Eisenhower and how they interacted specifically around civil rights issues in the 1950s. Most striking to me was how different a time it was politically - Warren and Eisenhower were centrist and courted as presidential candidates by <em>both</em> political parties. We could use some more of that today. Warren particularly was an interesting story to me. Second-generation European immigrant, son of blue-collar parents just scraping by, had fairness as an overriding political objective, and championed both social programs and fiscal responsibility, and somehow made it all work as governor of California.</p>

			 <p>Whatever you want to say about <em>The Greatest Showman</em>, it&rsquo;s not subtle. I know I&rsquo;m late to the party discussing this movie musical. Hugh Jackman reminds us he can sing and dance while telling a story that in all likelihood bears little resemblance to the actual life of P.T. Barnum. What&rsquo;s striking to me after watching it a couple times, though, is how the songwriters, performers, and director are expressing some very Christian themes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjxugyZCfuw">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Barnum is unashamedly putting together his &ldquo;circus&rdquo; (a critic&rsquo;s derogatory term that Barnum chooses to embrace) of oddities and &ldquo;freaks&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s the very tall man, the very short man, the very fat man, the very tattooed man, the trapeze artists, and (most notably in the show) the bearded lady. They are living in the shadows, mocked for their differences by the people around them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not a stranger to the dark Hide away, they say &lsquo;Cause we don&rsquo;t want your broken parts I&rsquo;ve learned to be ashamed of all my scars Run away, they say No one will love you as you are But I won&rsquo;t let them break me down to dust I know that there&rsquo;s a place for us For we are glorious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes these people receptive to Barnum&rsquo;s invitation to perform, though, is that he doesn&rsquo;t see them as freaks or mistakes but as <em>people</em> who need to be seen and loved and appreciated for who they are.</p>
<p>As a follower of Jesus I can affirm and need to be reminded of this attitude. Each person I encounter, even (especially?) if unseemly, <em>is</em> glorious, because they are a human who bears God&rsquo;s image. They are deserving of love and embrace, not <em>in spite</em> of who they are but <em>because</em> of who they are.</p>
<p>The movie goes on a fairly predictable story arc from there - Barnum&rsquo;s ambition drives him to pursue greater and greater success. His desire for the approval of the wealthy and elite drives him to be ashamed of his family of misfits. He chases high culture and leaves his wife and children behind to tour the country with a <em>prima donna</em>. He has his moment of realization, heads back home to try to reconcile with his wife and circus family, loses everything in a fire, and is finally brought back from despair by his circus family who have been there all along.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very on the nose. There are no real surprises. But it rings true, maybe not in a &ldquo;that&rsquo;s realistically how it could&rsquo;ve happened&rdquo; sense, but more in a &ldquo;this is what the redemption arc should look like&rdquo; sense.</p>
<p>And the gospel themes are present even right there in the finale. As Hugh Jackman is belting out the message that he has learned his lesson and will not, in the future, be blinded by the bright lights of fame, the circus performers have their own hopeful chorus in response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we will come back home And we will come back home Home again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there is the cry of every heart, though it manifests in diverse ways: a cry for redemption and for restoration. A cry that we could be home, loved for who we are, embraced by a family.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfGlq9Bz5-Y">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no obvious sign that <em>The Greatest Showman</em> was intended to bring any sort of Christian message. But it highlights to me how direct and relevant the message of Jesus is, even for those who may not be looking for it: that God is love, that we are created gloriously in His image, that He is working in our brokenness for redemption, and that He calls us to follow Jesus and be a part of that restoration.</p>
<p>This is the greatest story.</p>

			 <p>Matthew Lee Anderson has <a href="https://medium.com/@mattleeanderson/what-faithful-presence-demands-55fdc60325f7">published over on Medium</a> a transcription of a great little talk he gave recently at the Evangelical Theological Society. <em>[Aside: I cringe every time I see good authors publishing stuff at Medium&hellip; it&rsquo;s not hard to own your own words on a site of your own, come on, folks!]</em></p>
<p>Anderson makes the point that, as much as anything, it&rsquo;s evangelicals' <em>attitude</em> that needs to change - an approach that Andrew Wilson, picking up from Anderson and riffing off Rod Dreher, describes as <a href="https://thinktheology.co.uk/blog/article/the_taylor_swift_option">The Taylor Swift Option</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he conservative evangelical political witness has been fueled by a narrative of decline and of its own precarious position in the world. This narrative, that to be an evangelical means to be an embattled minority fighting the dark forces of an oppressive secularism lurking in every public school and in every corner of Hollywood, empowered evangelicals to be adept users of the grievance politics we are now so familiar with from other communities&hellip; Every response by evangelicals to contemporary events happens against this backdrop, whether we like it or not, or were responsible for it or not. <strong>Regardless of our intentions, our denunciations of the spirit of our age invariably take on the atmosphere of fear, anxiety, and resentment that has suffused evangelicalism’s political life for the past 30 years. The first task, then, is to purge ourselves of such affections and passions and establish the evangelical political witness on a new foundation.</strong> Such fear and resentment cannot be simply verbally repudiated; they must be expunged, rooted out and replaced by a hope that is less spoken of directly and more felt, a hope that we do not name but that permeates and suffuses our response to culture war conflicts. Such good cheer must be hearty, for Christ hath made our hearts glad—and he is waiting for our political discourse to someday catch up. Second, with this gladness <strong>I would commend a deflationary attitude toward those grand narratives of decline and to the day-to-day disputes and dramas that we think embody them.</strong> If the West is dying….so? If we are all going to be bigots, well, we might as well get on with it and become likeable bigots. If “marginalization” or “dhimmitude” are the new form of persecution, I for one will happily take it over many of the alternatives. The sooner we turn such instruments of stigma into pieces of art, the sooner we will begin actually resisting the very ideology we claim to be. As the prophet Taylor Swift hath said unto us, “haters gonna hate, hate, hate….you just gotta shake, shake, shake…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much for claiming the evangelical label myself these days, but I think Matt&rsquo;s put his finger on changes that have to be made if the evangelical church is ever to regain its witness in America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of the subtle dig thrown by Metropolitan Tikhon Mollard in the <a href="https://oca.org/holy-synod/statements/his-beatitude-metropolitan-tikhon/statement-concerning-june-26-us-supreme-court-decision">statement from the Orthodox church after the <em>Obergefell</em> ruling back in 2015</a>. His opening paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent ruling by the US Supreme Court on the legality of “same-sex marriages” has received much press coverage and has already caused some consternation about its implications and ramifications. But we Orthodox Christians must rest assured that the teaching of our Holy Church on the Mystery of Marriage remains the same as it has been for millennia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what&rsquo;s that, a &ldquo;recent ruling&rdquo;? The church has been around for <em>millennia</em>. We&rsquo;ll survive this. &quot;</p>
<p>Regardless of your feelings about <em>Obergefell</em>, this is the sort of attitude the evangelical church should be taking more often.</p>
<p>Now if I could just get that Taylor Swift song out of my head&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been chewing on Dr. Albert Mohler&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://albertmohler.com/2018/05/23/wrath-god-poured-humiliation-southern-baptist-convention/">The Humiliation of the Southern Baptist Convention</a> for the past several days. If you&rsquo;re interested in the topic of the #MeToo movement and the evangelical church, it&rsquo;s worth a read. In it Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, recognizes the rot of sexual misconduct and misogyny that is being brought to light in the Southern Baptist Church and more broadly in evangelicalism, and does what looks like some soul-searching for answers why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the problem theological? Has the Conservative Resurgence in the Southern Baptist Convention come to this? Is this what thousands of Southern Baptists were hoping for when they worked so hard to see this denomination returned to its theological convictions, its seminaries return to teaching the inerrancy of the Holy Scriptures, its ministries solidly established on the Gospel of Jesus Christ? Did we win confessional integrity only to sacrifice our moral integrity? This is exactly what those who opposed the Conservative Resurgence warned would happen. They claimed that the effort to recover the denomination theologically was just a disguised move to capture the denomination for a new set of power-hungry leaders. I know that was not true. I must insist that this was not true. But, it sure looks like their prophecies had some merit after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this is a pretty stunning bit of realization for Mohler. But on the other hand, I don&rsquo;t think he really goes far enough. Because he doesn&rsquo;t have any particular change to propose, other than &ldquo;people should stop doing that stuff, and we should stop covering it up&rdquo;. As Jake Meador says in <a href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/paige-patterson-abuse-scandal/">his brilliant piece on this topic</a>, &ldquo;I can’t help wondering: Where do Mohler and a few other prominent evangelical leaders go from here?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="a-few-cautious-words-of-critique">A few cautious words of critique&hellip;</h3>
<p>It feels like Mohler gets <em>this close</em> to having a more eye-opening realization, but just can&rsquo;t get there. Sure, people warned that this patriarchal complementarian theology would lend itself toward such abuses. And those warnings &ldquo;had some merit&rdquo;. But&hellip; that can&rsquo;t possibly mean that those people were right, can it?</p>
<p>Though it sounds like a jest, I&rsquo;ve frequently said quite seriously that I imagine at least 20% of my theological beliefs are wrong&hellip; I just don&rsquo;t know which 20% those are. And so while I clearly think my current beliefs are correct (because if they weren&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d change them), I remind myself to try to have the humility to realize that unquestionably some of them are wrong.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll allow that for someone as erudite as Dr. Mohler we might lower his likely percent-wrong-ness to something smaller than my own - 10%? Single digits? But it&rsquo;s still folly to suggest that it approaches 0%. What I wish we would see from Mohler is that next step to acknowledge even just the hint of a possibility that patriarchalism/complementarianism might be in that small percentage he could admit might be up for grabs - not to full-up change his position on it, but just to admit that maybe it&rsquo;s worth some open discussion.</p>
<h3 id="an-alternate-approach">An alternate approach</h3>
<p>I really appreciated <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/05/on-gender-power-and-sin-evangelical.html">Richard Beck&rsquo;s analysis of the situation today</a>. (I almost just linked to it instead of writing this post&hellip;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate [Mohler&rsquo;s] both/and balancing act here, trying to keep the complementarian structure yet speak a strong word for protecting the abused. And yet, this is the exact same balancing act that evangelicals and the SBC have been preaching and attempting for generations. And by Mohler&rsquo;s own admission, it has brought the judgment of God down upon them. In short, Mohler seems genuinely anguished and searching for answers, but he can&rsquo;t offer an accurate diagnosis of what went wrong. He seems legitimately perplexed. He says nothing beyond the same old, same old: Men are in charge, but they shouldn&rsquo;t abuse the women under their leadership. But clearly, that&rsquo;s been a disaster. And it&rsquo;s not really hard to see why. I think the problem evangelicals are having here is the same problem they always have. They only look at the Bible and they ignore human experience. Evangelicals always make man serve the Sabbath, rather than having the Sabbath serve man. In this instance, the Sabbath is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s plan for marriage and the church,&rdquo; and men and women must conform to that plan. Come hell or high water. Well, they&rsquo;ve found hell and high water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beck goes on to make the case that the Scripture is not conclusive as to either complementarianism or egalitarianism, and that with freedom in where we land on the question, we should consider the <em>results</em> of the positions as we look for a landing place. Egalitarianism, Beck argues, provides more concrete, structural ways of protecting women. (It&rsquo;s worth reading <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/05/on-gender-power-and-sin-evangelical.html">Beck&rsquo;s whole piece</a> - I&rsquo;ve summarized about 6 paragraphs of his here.)</p>
<h3 id="time-to-wrap-this-up">Time to wrap this up&hellip;</h3>
<p>The position and argument that Beck describes is more or less where I find myself these days. While I know and respect many who would disagree (on both ends of the spectrum!), I think there&rsquo;s plenty of room to argue the topic, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s essential to the gospel message. I think it is reasonable and helpful to look at the fruit these positions have produced over the past few decades, too. And I pray that, regardless of where churches and pastors land on complementarianism / egalitarianism, concrete, structural safeguards are in place to ensure that women are not just protected but lifted up as equals and co-heirs of the Kingdom.</p>

			 <p>Books I&rsquo;ve read the past couple months:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2LjPNLB"><em>Waypoint Kangaroo</em> by Curtis C. Chen</a></strong></p>
<p>A fun little sci-fi story I discovered on the library shelf. A sort of space-based adventure / mystery story where the main character has a special ability that comes in quite handy at times.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2s1chIs"><em>Traitor</em> by Jonathan de Shalit</a></strong></p>
<p>A not-so-memorable spy novel.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2GBlGM9"><em>Immeasurable: Reflections on the Soul of Ministry in the Age of Church, Inc.</em> by Skye Jethani</a></strong></p>
<p>A hit-and-miss collection of essays. When Jethani is on, his insight into the issues in evangelicalism are really good.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2kdWO4s"><em>Kangaroo Too</em> by Curtis C. Chen</a></strong></p>
<p>Hey, I liked the first book in the series&hellip; The second one was pretty good, too.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2LjsKAv"><em>The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve</em> by Stephen Greenblatt</a></strong></p>
<p>An overview of the various historical perspectives on Adam and Eve. Easy to read, fairly interesting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2GzR9OU"><em>City of Endless Night</em> by Douglas Preston</a></strong></p>
<p>I have always enjoyed the Agent Pendergast series from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. This one was no exception.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2KJZtya"><em>What Are We Doing Here?</em> by Marilynne Robinson</a></strong></p>
<p>I typically love Robinson&rsquo;s essays, but this book left me a bit cold. Its themes are more repetitive than her previous books of essays - perhaps because they&rsquo;re condensed from various talks she&rsquo;s given?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2GzRwcg"><em>Educated: A Memoir</em> by Tara Westover</a></strong></p>
<p>A fascinating account of growing up as an unschooled Mormon survivalist in Idaho and the journey out to the real world. And it has some really great cover art.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ize7Yk"><em>Streams of Living Water: Celebrating the Great Traditions of Christian Faith</em> by Richard J. Foster</a></strong></p>
<p>Foster reviews key contributions to the Christian faith from various Christian traditions. Encouraging precisely because it recognizes first that these truly are all strands of the Christian faith (an angle that too many in my current flavor of evangelicalism would dispute) and second, that they provide rich value to believers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2rVqN4y"><em>The Night Trade</em> by Barry Eisler</a></strong></p>
<p>Eisler knows how to write a thriller.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2kcDPY3"><em>The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World</em> by Catherine Nixey</a></strong></p>
<p>I picked this one up from the library against my better judgment, but thought the topic was interesting and that I&rsquo;d go into it with an open mind. The author admits in the preface that she is telling a one-sided story, and then she grinds that axe for the entire book. Sure, Christianity has a checkered history, but to hear Nixey tell it the world would be a rich nirvana of love and learning were it not for centuries of hateful narrow-minded Christians.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2LkYNQS"><em>The Deceivers</em> by Alex Berenson</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never read Berenson before. This one&rsquo;s a passable spy thriller adopting a ripped-from-the-headlines plot of Russian interference in a US presidential election. They just don&rsquo;t make spy novels anymore like Tom Clancy used to.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2Li3smx"><em>The Right Stuff</em> by Tom Wolfe</a></strong></p>
<p>Following my sad pattern of being prompted to read famous authors after hearing of their deaths, I picked this one up after Tom Wolfe passed away last week. Now I&rsquo;m gonna have to go find some of his other books. While the story of the test pilots who became the first round of US astronauts in the late 1950s is interesting enough on its own, what&rsquo;s truly memorable is Wolfe&rsquo;s voice and style.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written something on positive politics. Let&rsquo;s dive in to another completely non-controversial topic: health care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted a little bit to say &ldquo;just read <a href="https://matthewandmaggie.org/writing/">everything Matthew Loftus has written</a> on the topic&rdquo; and leave it at that. But that would be cheating, so I&rsquo;ll leave that as a secondary recommendation.</p>
<p>Maybe this&rsquo;ll be easier if I just state some positions first, then I&rsquo;ll try to justify them.</p>
<ul>
<li>A modern, first-world society should have among its goals that its people have the ability to get health care, including medical and mental health.</li>
<li>This ability should largely be independent of a person&rsquo;s individual income level.</li>
<li>The only practical way this will happen is via government involvement including taxation and funding for care.</li>
<li>Provision of some sort of universal coverage would benefit the American people and society in measures other than just physical health.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, let&rsquo;s dig in.</p>
<h4 id="a-modern-first-world-society-should-have-among-its-goals-that-its-people-have-the-ability-to-get-health-care-including-medical-and-mental-health">A modern, first-world society should have among its goals that its people have the ability to get health care, including medical and mental health</h4>
<p>This seems like it should be almost self-evident. Government should exist to promote human flourishing. And humans will flourish much more when they have access to medical and mental care than when they don&rsquo;t.</p>
<h4 id="the-ability-to-get-health-care-should-largely-be-independent-of-a-persons-individual-income-level">The ability to get health care should largely be independent of a person&rsquo;s individual income level.</h4>
<p>Again, because it encourages flourishing. Because poor people are currently forced to make bad choices about health care because they don&rsquo;t have the income to make better choices.</p>
<p>Preventive care isn&rsquo;t freely available, so treatable issues get ignored until they become emergencies. Emergency care gets used and abused for all sorts of inappropriate situations because it&rsquo;s legally more available to the poor.</p>
<p>Health issues snowball and drive other societal issues. Lack of basic preventive care leads to more serious health issues. Which can lead to lack of employment, which makes it even harder to afford any care. Repeated or chronic health issues can lead to self-medicating with tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Which leads to other health issues, and to deterioration of social relationships, and to crime.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no just reason that only wealthy people should have medical care. And poor people might find it easier to work their way up the ladder if they had health care available to them.</p>
<h4 id="the-only-practical-way-this-will-happen-is-via-government-involvement-including-taxation-and-funding-for-care">The only practical way this will happen is via government involvement including taxation and funding for care.</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard lots of arguments for why this isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>A lot of right-wing Christians will say that the church should provide for these needs. To which I say great, but that solution doesn&rsquo;t scale. There are by rough estimates <a href="http://hirr.hartsem.edu/research/fastfacts/fast_facts.html">about 350,000 churches or other religious communities in America</a>. American health care spending is roughly <a href="http://www.crfb.org/papers/american-health-care-health-spending-and-federal-budget">$3.5 trillion per year</a>. That means each church in America would need to put $10 million per year toward health care. It doesn&rsquo;t scale.</p>
<p><em>Update: a friend pointed out that church giving might only need cover the gaps, not the whole medical cost for the country - an excellent point that I missed here. But in 2016, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html">per the Census Bureau</a>, about 9% of the country was without health insurance coverage. So maybe the cost of the gap is only $1M per church instead of $10M&hellip; still doesn&rsquo;t scale.</em></p>
<p>But there are other collaborative ways that people can band together to fund medical care! I know people who have been in faith-based health care cooperatives where everyone sends in their bills and the costs are split among all members. Great as far as it goes, but at the macro level it still fails the care-for-neighbor test.</p>
<p>Over the past few years we&rsquo;ve seen a proliferation of social media campaigns for health care help. Donate to this GoFundMe to pay for my uncle&rsquo;s kidney transplant! Or my sister&rsquo;s cancer treatment! Or my friend&rsquo;s medical expenses from his car accident! Seeing successful responses to campaigns can be heartwarming, but how many are there that go unfilled and wither in quiet desperation?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/igerner/status/915240389812129794">twitter.com/igerner/s&hellip;</a></p>
<h4 id="provision-of-some-sort-of-universal-coverage-would-benefit-the-american-people-and-society-in-measures-other-than-just-physical-health">Provision of some sort of universal coverage would benefit the American people and society in measures other than just physical health.</h4>
<p>This is closely tied to the point about coverage not being tied to income. How many people would take an entrepreneurial plunge or feel freedom to pursue some other dream if they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about keeping a standard job at a corporation just so their family could keep health insurance?</p>
<p>How many people would have their mental, social, and community lives significantly enhanced simply by being healthier? How many people&rsquo;s lives would improve from eliminating the mental stress associated with wondering how a loved one will get care?</p>
<h4 id="but-isnt-this-gonna-cost-a-lot-and-isnt-the-government-super-inefficient-at-managing-things">But isn&rsquo;t this gonna cost a lot? And isn&rsquo;t the government super-inefficient at managing things?</h4>
<p>Well, yeah, it&rsquo;s gonna cost a lot. But the current system isn&rsquo;t cheap or super-efficient, either. Multiple levels of for-profit for corporations involved ensure that everyone involved gets a cut. It doesn&rsquo;t take much more than looking through a single hospital bill detailing hundred-dollar Tylenol, thousand-dollar titanium screws, billed costs vs. negotiated costs, and on and on, to recognize that the current system has significant issues.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s not a simple problem to solve, but the rest of the first world has found ways to address it, and America should too.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h4>
<p>So let’s evaluate these against the five-principle framework.</p>
<p><em>1. Is it good for the poor?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>2. Is it good for the planet?</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that it affects the planet one way or another.</p>
<p><em>3. Does it promote peace?</em></p>
<p>More broadly available health care should, in the end, help promote peace, since healthier people will be happier and more stable people.</p>
<p><em>4. Does it challenge the powerful?</em></p>
<p>If more equality in this area challenges the powerful, then yes.</p>
<p><em>5. Does it let the marginalized have a seat at the table to speak for themselves?</em></p>
<p>Indirectly, more available health care would help the marginalized be in a better place to be able to speak for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a balance to be struck where it comes to work and rest, but in the United States, values and laws are already slanted drastically in favor of work. I would advise those concerned about Americans’ dignity, freedom and independence to not focus on compelling work for benefits or otherwise trying to marshal people into jobs when what they really need are health care, housing assistance, unemployment benefits and so forth. Instead, we should focus more of our political energies on making sure that American workers have the dignity of rest, the freedom to enjoy their lives outside of labor and independence from the whims of their employers.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/04/on-tribes-and-community-part-6-our-kids.html">Richard Beck has an insightful piece up</a> on a topic that&rsquo;s had me thinking. While he&rsquo;s a decade older and from a different denominational background than I am, he and I have traveled a similar path from a strict conservative Christianity into a progressive post-evangelicalism. But what impact, he asks, does this have on our children?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, we were talking about how our kids now view the church. We&rsquo;ve become liberal in our views and so we&rsquo;ve raised our kids as liberals. We&rsquo;ve preached messages of tolerance and inclusion. And we&rsquo;ve been successful. Our kids don&rsquo;t look on the world with judgment and suspicion. They welcome difference. But we&rsquo;ve noticed that this comes with a price. Our kids don&rsquo;t have the same loyalty to the church as we do. We were raised conservatively, so going and being loyal to a local church is hardwired into us. We can&rsquo;t imagine not going to church. It&rsquo;s who we are. But our kids weren&rsquo;t raised by conservatives, they were raised by us, post-evangelical liberals. Consequently, our kids don&rsquo;t have that same loyalty toward the church. So we were talking about this paradox in our small group, how our kids weren&rsquo;t raised by our parents, they were raised by us, and how that&rsquo;s made our kids unlike us. Especially when it comes to how we feel about church. Basically, our kids aren&rsquo;t post-evangelicals. They are liberals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that he doesn&rsquo;t mean that being a liberal is a bad thing, but that he wonders if his children will have a rootedness in a community and deep sense of belonging that he experienced growing up in a more conservative environment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had similar questions about raising my own children. While I consider myself pretty solidly post-evangelical, as a family we have spent the last decade as committed members of a fairly conservative evangelical church. My kids attend Sunday School and youth group and get taught many of the same things I did when I was their age. Then they come home and I feel the tension keenly when we have discussions about hot topics that have come up - things like evolution, gender roles, religious tolerance, and historical and textual criticism of the Bible.</p>
<p>Maybe my willingness to stay committed to a conservative church gives lie to the claim that I&rsquo;m post-evangelical. I guess that&rsquo;s ok with me - it&rsquo;s not like post-evangelicalism is a club for which I need to establish my bona fides. What I&rsquo;m really hoping for my kids is that we can find a sweet spot in the middle - one that doesn&rsquo;t view orthodox doctrine and social responsibility as an either/or proposition but rather a both/and, one that sees questions as a sign of a strong faith rather than a weak one about to shatter.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s truly the journey that has shaped my theology and Christian outlook into what it is today, but I&rsquo;m holding onto hope that my children can find their path to a confident faith even through being raised by a meandering post-evangelical.</p>

<p>I just posted this to Facebook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So let&rsquo;s review what we&rsquo;ve learned about Facebook in the past couple of weeks:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>They allowed an app to do mass scraping of user data, including the data of friends of app users, and then didn&rsquo;t reveal that information disclosure for years afterward.</li>
<li>The combination of that user data, along with the targeted advertising Facebook sells, allowed foreign entities to manipulate the electorate in unprecedented ways leading up to the 2016 US elections and the 2016 Brexit referendum in Britain.</li>
<li>They have regularly scraped up user&rsquo;s phone data wherever possible, including location history, phone call logs, and the contents of text messages - including even those sent outside of the Facebook application.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
At this point I think it&rsquo;s fair to ask: is it really worth it? Am I getting benefit from Facebook that outweighs the cost of enabling this sort of corporate behavior and community effect? There&rsquo;s a truism in the online world: if you&rsquo;re not paying for the product, chances are that you <em>are</em> the product. That&rsquo;s certainly true with Facebook. And Google. And probably a lot of other online products and services. (It&rsquo;s no accident that the products you search for on Amazon suddenly show up in ads on Facebook!) While we may never be able to get out of this model completely, there are steps I can take to do my part.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>I&rsquo;m switching over to use <a href="http://www.duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> instead of Google for my web searches. DuckDuckGo doesn&rsquo;t track users, making their money only via untracked advertising and untracked affiliate links.</li>
<li>I pay for email service from <a href="http://www.protonmail.com">ProtonMail</a>. It&rsquo;s not as shiny and slick as Gmail, but they also don&rsquo;t scan my email to target ads. (I still have a Gmail account as a backup&hellip; but I&rsquo;m trying to not use it regularly.)</li>
<li>I pay for <a href="http://www.newsblur.com">Newsblur</a> as an RSS feed reader. I subscribe to ~500 blogs and websites via their RSS feeds&hellip; this provides me the bulk of my news on a daily basis.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve written before about <a href="/14/03/my-swedish-doppelganger/">my Swedish Doppelganger</a> - the botanist Carl Skottsberg in his younger years, at least according to my sister-in-law. Yesterday I was alerted to another one.</p>
<p>Information on this alleged doppelganger comes to me from an older lady at church. She approached me yesterday to say that she watches the Jimmy Swaggart (eek!) TV program, gave me the DISH Network channel that she sees it on, and that Jimmy has a pianist who looks &ldquo;just like&rdquo; me and plays the piano &ldquo;just as well&rdquo; as I do.</p>
<p>I had to know more.</p>
<p>It turns out the pianist and band leader at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries is a guy named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIoEdmpoD60G2mluWUABoAcG8UunX-GZC">Brian Haney</a>. And, well&hellip; I see the resemblance.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Brian again:</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><strong>Me again:</strong>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If I had the time to dig up a few more pictures I&rsquo;m sure I could find one of me at a piano that has eerie similarities to that one of Brian. I get that the white guy with the shaved head and beard is probably enough to trigger the churchgoing lady&rsquo;s awareness, but I think there&rsquo;s a little more than that.</p>
<p>I watched a few of Brian&rsquo;s YouTube videos and the dude is a talented musician. I might be able to match his Southern Gospel piano riffs, but he&rsquo;s got a voice that I sure don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>He does seem to have a tendency for unfortunately-named songs, though&hellip; &ldquo;I Found The Lily In My Valley&rdquo; and &ldquo;When God Dips His Pen Of Love In My Heart&rdquo; make me realize CCM doesn&rsquo;t have an exclusive on unintended innuendo.</p>
<p>If you know of other doppelgangers of mine feel free to mention them&hellip; but really, the world probably has enough guys that look like me already. We don&rsquo;t need to overdo it.</p>

			 <p>Books I&rsquo;ve read over the past month or so:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2HNA6df"><em>A Gentleman in Moscow</em> by Amor Towles</a></strong> An utterly charming novel about a Russian nobleman confined to hotel &ldquo;house arrest&rdquo; after the 1917 revolution. His adventures interacting with hotel staff (which he soon becomes) and guests are full of wit and grace and humor. I don&rsquo;t recall who recommended this one to me but I owe them my thanks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2IDb2Xt"><em>The People Are Going to Rise Like the Waters Upon Your Shore: A Story of American Rage</em> by Jared Yates Sexton</a></strong> A memoir from a liberal writer who covered the 2016 US presidential election. Heartfelt, but not as interesting or memorable as I had hoped it might be.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2FVv8L3"><em>House of Spies</em> by Daniel Silva</a></strong> OK, the Gabriel Allon series is getting old. I probably should&rsquo;ve figured that out seeing as this is book #17 in the series.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2IAUgYU"><em>1Q84</em> by Haruki Murakami</a></strong> I first became acquainted with Murakami through his <em>Absolutely on Music</em> book that I read a couple months ago. Having discovered he was a novelist I figured it was worth reading one. <em>1Q84</em> was just interesting enough to keep me going through its 900 pages. I guess it&rsquo;s a love story at heart, albeit one with some odd and unexplained sci-fi twists.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2HK1fh2"><em>An Unkindness of Ghosts</em> by Rivers Solomon</a></strong> A YA sci-fi novel with strong race / slavery / gender themes. Interesting in that it tried hard to represent a lot of racial and gender diversity. Managed to do it while only a little bit heavy-handed with the message.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2FVx1Y9"><em>We the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights</em> by Adam Winkler</a></strong> Heard about this one on an episode of NPR&rsquo;s <em>Fresh Air</em>. Fascinating (to me, a bit of a con law nerd) history of how American law has treated corporations with regard to rights and freedoms. Some cases, it seems, have had unintended consequences as the years went by; Ralph Nader&rsquo;s efforts to win corporate speech rights back in the 1970&rsquo;s seemed meant to benefit ordinary people by freeing up information that the government had restricted. Those same rights were used as the basis 30 years later for deciding in <em>Citizens United</em> that corporations could dump unlimited money into political campaigns.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pnj6DK"><em>Crimes of the Father</em> by Thomas Keneally</a></strong> The author of the novel <em>Schindler&rsquo;s List</em> takes on the Catholic church abuse scandal. Pleasant yet forgettable prose.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2HKsxDY"><em>Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention</em> by Manning Marable</a></strong> Realized I didn&rsquo;t know much about Malcolm X, and this particular biography was recommended by Ta-Nehisi Coates somewhere. A very readable picture of a fascinating man.</p>

<li>Video streams load smoothly, don&rsquo;t often buffer</li>
<li>YouTubeTV includes streams of local TV channels, which is awesome since a couple of our local channels have weak over-the-air signals</li>
<li>very intuitive live TV guide grid (this is notably missing from Hulu)</li>
<li>Cloud DVR function is intuitive and feels like you&rsquo;d expect a DVR to behave (mostly. we&rsquo;ll get to that)</li>
<li>Cost is similar to Hulu and Sling</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all good stuff. No real complaints here.</p>
<h4 id="the-bad">The Bad</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cloud DVR doesn&rsquo;t seem to differentiate between new episodes and re-runs. This is such an obvious oversight I can&rsquo;t really believe they shipped it this way. If I&rsquo;m interested in The Big Bang Theory, I want to record and watch the new episodes, but not the re-runs that are in syndication. YouTubeTV DVR doesn&rsquo;t have a way to say &ldquo;new episodes only&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s pretty much a dealbreaker.</li>
<li>No Food Network or HGTV. Apparently Google doesn&rsquo;t have a contract with Scripps yet for those channels. For my family, that&rsquo;s a dealbreaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only have a couple things listed here, but they&rsquo;re biggies. I assume Google is working to fix those, but until they are corrected, YouTubeTV is really a non-starter for me.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>For the moment I&rsquo;m sticking with Hulu Live. Their stream quality has been good, they have all the channels we want, and the DVR-type function is sufficient. They have promised that they have a major app update coming that&rsquo;ll help navigate the live TV. If they implement a grid-type guide system and keep or improve their DVR function, they&rsquo;re the right choice for me right now. But YouTubeTV is close enough that with a few improvements they could jump up to the top of the list.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/02/my-fasting-routine.html">Richard Beck describes</a> one of his concerns with traditional Lenten fasting and his rationale for working within it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a rule of thumb I like to keep: Don&rsquo;t let your pursuit of holiness pull you away from your family. As a part of this, I&rsquo;ve always disliked how fasting pulls me away from family meals. Sure, I can sit at the table and talk while everyone is eating, but that&rsquo;s just weird. Eating&ndash;actually eating&ndash;with my family is a profoundly important experience. I also don&rsquo;t like how fasting affects my ability to accept hospitality when offered. When someone invites you to a table you should eat. Even if you&rsquo;re fasting. So my normal fasting routine is this: Eat only one meal a day, family dinner at night. If you&rsquo;re invited to eat with someone, accept, don&rsquo;t decline because you are fasting. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t eat during the week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impact to family meals has always been a big hesitation for me when thinking about this kind of fasting. I appreciate Beck&rsquo;s reasoning here&hellip; makes sense and seems like something I could adopt.</p>

<p>The other night we were playing &ldquo;Name that Disney movie&rdquo; while shuffling soundtracks on Spotify. The question I have rattling around in my head two days later is this:</p>
<p>Do I like the <em>Moana</em> songs so much because I like their distinctive style? Because I <em>do</em> think that Lin-Manuel Miranda&rsquo;s approach feels and sounds very different than what, say, Robert Lopez and Kristin Anderson-Lopez do in <em>Frozen</em> or what Randy Newman does in half the Pixar movies ever made&hellip;</p>
<p>Or am I just drawn to them because I love Lin-Manuel so much that I will irrationally support and be attracted to whatever he produces?</p>
<p>This question bothers me more than I&rsquo;d like.</p>

<li>Where do the guns get stored? How do we prevent children from getting them?</li>
<li>Are teachers allowed to shoot first? Or only after they hear gunfire?</li>
<li>How do teachers know who the good guy is, and who the bad guy is? How do we ensure there’s no friendly fire?</li>
</ul>

			 <p>How long must we continue to sacrifice children on the altar of the Second Amendment?</p>
<p>As Christians, being &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; must extend beyond the unborn life to care for <em>all</em> of life. Do we love our guns so much that we are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/04/gun-violence-research-has-been-shut-down-for-20-years/">unwilling to even allow studies of gun violence</a>?</p>
<p>We must be Christians first and Americans later. Do we really think Jesus would say <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/21/us/connecticut-school-shooting/index.html">the solution is <em>more</em> guns</a>?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say that we shouldn&rsquo;t get political with our Christianity. Christian beliefs have political implications. As N. T. Wright says, to declare &ldquo;Jesus is Lord&rdquo; is to inherently say that &ldquo;Caesar is not&rdquo;. Our priorities and attitudes should be shaped by the Sermon on the Mount before the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Enough is enough. I&rsquo;m not saying there is an easy solution, but allowing the unchecked proliferation of guns cannot be the answer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I start each year with the intent of writing up Finished Reading posts on a book-by-book basis. Then I find myself in the first week of February and realize I&rsquo;m nine books behind already. So it&rsquo;s compendium time. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve ready in 2018 so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2GTcBzV"><strong><em>The Bomb Maker</em> by Thomas Perry</strong></a> - A fairly nondescript detective story, but an entertaining way to spend the end of my Christmas break.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2nOmgyL"><strong><em>Slow Church: Cultivating Community in the Patient Way of Jesus</em> by C. Christopher Smith</strong></a> - A call to build church community slowly and faithfully in an era when we want everything to have a formula.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2GTXq9w"><strong><em>Imagining the Kingdom: How Worship Works</em> by James K. A. Smith</strong></a> - the second book in Smith&rsquo;s <em>Cultural Liturgies</em> trilogy, reminding us that we are formed by our bodies and daily physical practices in deeper ways than the mental/intellectual formation activities we undertake. I didn&rsquo;t find this one as readable or interesting as <em>Desiring the Kingdom</em>, but I&rsquo;m definitely sticking around for the third book of the series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2BcrBIt"><strong><em>Breeder</em> by K. B. Hoyle</strong></a> - a fun little dystopian YA story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2ELkCpW"><strong><em>To Sin Against Hope: Life and Politics on the Borderland</em> by Alfredo Gutierrez</strong></a> - a memoir of a Mexican American activist and politician. A good bit of history that I was unfamiliar with - the Mexican American experience in the US southwest in the 1960s - 1980s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2Bb9z9s"><strong><em>The Take</em> by Christopher Reich</strong></a> - I&rsquo;ve enjoyed a bunch of Reich&rsquo;s other thrillers, but this one didn&rsquo;t really do it for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2nPuYN9"><strong><em>Death Before the Fall: Biblical Literalism and the Problem of Animal Suffering</em> by Ronald E. Osborn</strong></a> - Really enjoyed this one. Osborn comes from a denomination (Seventh Day Adventist) that requires a strict literalist view of the Genesis 1-2 creation account. He gives that account a close reading and grapples with what philosophical problems such a view can give us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2BJp6hV"><strong><em>Absolutely on Music: Conversations with Seiji Ozawa</em> by Haruki Murakami</strong></a> - a Japanese author (and music lover) sat down and had several conversations with the noted conductor. These are presented as an edited transcript. I am fascinated by the insights into the mind of a musician.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2GRLipx"><strong><em>At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance - A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power</em> by Danielle L. McGuire</strong></a> - Oof, this one was a challenge. Not from a readability perspective, but because it forces the reader to grapple with the blanket acceptance of white-on-black violence, including sexual violence, that was prevalent in the American south up through the 1960s and even into the 1970s. White men would routinely kidnap and rape black women, knowing that they would likely not even be arrested, and that if they were tried they would be acquitted. What an evil history, and so recent. Terrifying.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/02/01/the-gospel-coalition.html">The Gospel Coalition has its #MeToo moment</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/02/01/the-gospel-coalition.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-02-01 09:15:50 -0500">Feb 1, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The pace of sexual abuse allegations and resignations / firings in the wake of the #MeToo movement has been stunning. Since early October when Harvey Weinstein was deposed from his organization, executives, journalists, actors, athletes, and doctors with patterns of abuse have been uncovered and summarily fired, retired, and replaced.</p>
<p>Last week, the trial of US Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar provided the most heartbreaking story yet as <a href="http://time.com/5116275/gymnasts-victim-statements-lassar-nassar-sentencing/">160 women gave victim impact statements</a>, confronting a man who had abused each of them under the guise of providing medical treatment. (As many as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/larry-nasser-abuse-sentence-victims-latest-court-judge-michigan-judge-janice-cunningham-a8187926.html">265 people have now come forward</a> accusing Nassar of abuse.) Rachael Denhollander, a victim of Nassar&rsquo;s as a teen, was the key witness in his prosecution and provided the capstone victim impact statement last Friday. In a 30-minute address in the courtroom, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/24/us/rachael-denhollander-full-statement/index.html">Denhollander spoke bluntly</a> about the systems that had failed her and Nassar&rsquo;s other victims, about her struggles to advocate for abuse victims, and then about the good news of the Gospel.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wehpkiflXMs' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Denhollander&rsquo;s statement went viral. My Facebook and Twitter feeds were full of Christians, from leaders to laymen, lionizing her courage and willingness to share the Gospel so publicly. But from a close reading of her statement, there was a question stuck in my head: she said that her victim advocacy &ldquo;cost me my church&rdquo;. What was that all about?</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html">fantastic interview with Christianity Today</a>, the other shoe dropped. Rachael revealed that the church she lost was a church &ldquo;directly involved in restoring&rdquo; Sovereign Grace founder C. J. Mahaney, who left his pastorate after being <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/02/14/the-sex-abuse-scandal-that-devastated-a-suburban-megachurch-sovereign-grace-ministries/">accused of covering up sexual abuse within his church network</a>. She says that she and her husband were told by multiple church elders that this church &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t the place for them&rsquo; if they were going to speak out for abuse victims that way.</p>
<h3 id="this-hits-close-to-home">This hits close to home.</h3>
<p>Mahaney was a council member of <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/">The Gospel Coalition</a> (TGC), a group that is strongly influential in the evangelical circles I&rsquo;ve been in all my life. TGC leaders have consistently supported Mahaney, with Southern Baptist Theological Seminary president Albert Mohler <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pastor-accused-of-covering-up-abuse-returns-to-spotlight">making jokes about the accusations against Mahaney</a> while introducing him as a &ldquo;guest speaker&rdquo; at the &ldquo;Together for the Gospel&rdquo; (T4G) conference in 2016. Mahaney <a href="https://world.wng.org/2014/05/mahaney_harris_leave_gospel_coalition_council">resigned from the TGC council</a> after the abuse scandal broke, but has slowly, without publicly addressing the allegations, worked his way back into good standing with the group. He is now back as a regular headline plenary speaker at <a href="http://t4g.org/">T4G 2018</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Mahaney isn&rsquo;t the only T4G plenary speaker in the penumbra of this kind of allegations. A former student at The Master&rsquo;s College, founded by John MacArthur, has <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2017/09/25/janes-story-leaders-failed/">come forward to allege</a> that the leaders of that college forced her into a &ldquo;biblical counseling&rdquo; session with her abuser, and then threatened church discipline if she refused to drop charges, eventually kicking her out of the school.</p>
<h3 id="its-time-for-the-gospel-coalition-to-come-to-grips-with-their-own-metoo-moment">It&rsquo;s time for The Gospel Coalition to come to grips with their own #MeToo moment.</h3>
<p>TGC is filled with men (and yes, it&rsquo;s only men) who have served long in ministry and been helpful to many. I&rsquo;ve personally benefited from the teaching of MacArthur and Matt Chandler and TGC founder Don Carson over the years. But in this cultural moment, their willing blindness to these issues is inexcusable, and their silence is deafening. Indeed, this planned T4G 2018 seminar leads me to believe they still really don&rsquo;t get it:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="we-can-do-better">We can do better.</h3>
<p>How loudly would it speak to the watching world if Rachael Denhollander were invited to be a plenary speaker at T4G18? For the leaders of the theological movement that Rachael and her husband are a part of to recognize their failures in the area of addressing abuse, to repent, and to hear the truth spoken by their sister?</p>
<p>Rachael is a survivor of abuse and mistreatment from the hands of both a despicable doctor and a group of church leaders more intent on protecting themselves than their sheep. Her words cry out to them like the blood of Cain&rsquo;s brother calling from the ground. From the end of <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/january-web-only/rachael-denhollander-larry-nassar-forgiveness-gospel.html">her interview with CT</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the gospel of Jesus Christ does not need your protection. It defies the gospel of Christ when we do not call out abuse and enable abuse in our own church. Jesus Christ does not need your protection; he needs your obedience. Obedience means that you pursue justice and you stand up for the oppressed and you stand up for the victimized, and you tell the truth about the evil of sexual assault and the evil of covering it up. Second, that obedience costs. It means that you will have to speak out against your own community. It will cost to stand up for the oppressed, and it should. If we’re not speaking out when it costs, then it doesn’t matter to us enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rachael Denhollander is a hero and example to us all. It&rsquo;s time for The Gospel Coalition to admit their complicity in these things and show true repentance. Come on, guys, set an example for us. Invite Rachael to speak at T4G. Let&rsquo;s show the world what it can really mean to be together for the Gospel.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/01/23/positive-politics-religious.html">Positive Politics: Religious Liberty</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2018/01/23/positive-politics-religious.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-01-23 09:46:02 -0500">Jan 23, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s been too long since I&rsquo;ve written in this series. So let&rsquo;s tackle something that I&rsquo;m sure isn&rsquo;t controversial <em>at all</em> - religious liberty.</p>
<h3 id="free-exercise">Free exercise</h3>
<p>I think this part is actually pretty straightforward. As guaranteed by the First Amendment, each person should have free exercise of their religion. This will feel strange at times as our country, which has traditionally been majority Christian, becomes more diverse. But at the basic level, we should welcome and spend time getting to know our neighbors of other faiths, and encourage the building and protection of mosques and temples in the same way we care for Christian churches.</p>
<h3 id="congress-shall-make-no-law">&ldquo;Congress shall make no law&hellip;&rdquo;</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets a little more challenging. What does it look like to respect an establishment of religion? What about this &ldquo;separation of church and state&rdquo;?</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/religious-symbols.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From a Christian standpoint, we first need to have a clear recognition of how closely tied our American governments have been to the Christian church and Christian principles. This isn&rsquo;t inherently a bad thing. However, it gets more and more difficult as our country becomes more diverse and as the general population becomes less and less devotedly (or at all) Christian.</p>
<p>The positive influence that Christianity can bring to this country must come from the church, not from the government. People will be drawn to Christ through the beauty and love of the Gospel message, not because Christians win legal battles to have school-sponsored Christian prayers and exclusive access to the city park for a Christian nativity scene.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about">But what about&hellip;</h3>
<p>The current sticky places in the religious liberty discussion are where evolving cultural views of civil rights and protected classes come into conflict with sincerely held religious convictions. So let&rsquo;s talk about just a couple of them.</p>
<h4 id="the-gay-wedding-cake">The Gay Wedding Cake</h4>
<p>This one is currently before the Supreme Court. Gay couple wants to order a custom wedding cake. Christian baker refuses. State prosecutes the baker for violating anti-discrimination laws. What&rsquo;s a man to do?</p>
<p>If it were me personally, I think I would&rsquo;ve been OK baking the cake. I&rsquo;m not a professional baker, but I <em>am</em> a musician who has occasionally been paid for playing at weddings, receptions, and the like. And I would be OK with providing my musical services at the reception after a same-sex wedding. But that really just speaks to the state of my convictions, not the overall principle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on board with <a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2017/12/08/andrew-sullivan-on-the-gay-wedding-cake-case/">Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s summary statement</a> from last month: if the Christians had been more Christian, or the liberals more liberal, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation. There&rsquo;s no question that our societal views are changing. What we need in an age of significant shifts is time for adjustment. Bend a branch too hard and too quickly and it will snap and cause significant damage. Apply pressure gently over time and it will accommodate the changes.</p>
<h4 id="contraceptive-coverage">Contraceptive Coverage</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_v._Hobby_Lobby_Stores,_Inc.">Hobby Lobby case</a> is the exemplar here. The law requires employers to provide a basic level of health insurance, including contraceptive coverage for women. The owners of Hobby Lobby have a religious objection to the use of some forms of contraception and refuse to provide the coverage. Slightly more challenging is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubik_v._Burwell">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> case, in which a Catholic order that runs a group of homes for the low-income elderly similarly refuses to participate in providing contraceptive coverage, even to the point of refusing to sign a form saying they won&rsquo;t provide it, because that form would then trigger government coverage, which the Little Sisters believe would make them complicit in the sin.</p>
<p>In these cases I&rsquo;d like to sidestep things a little bit.</p>
<p>First, we need to take a long look at the rights of corporations. While corporate entities are necessary for the economy, the pattern of extending the rights of persons to corporations has a weakening effect on our democracy. When corporate entities are entitled to free political speech (spending), the richest can quickly overwhelm the political messaging arena in ways that ensure they get richer. With the Hobby Lobby case, the court allowed for corporations to exercise the religious rights of their owners. As a basic principle I would suggest that for-profit corporations should not receive all of these rights reserved for the people.</p>
<p>Second, the United States should get away from the employer-provided health care system altogether. Having health coverage tied to employment makes less and less sense in an economy that is moving toward more fluid employment situations and more self-employment / freelance work. While that discussion belongs in another post focusing specifically on health care, I bring it up here just to note that in a system where health coverage was not tied to employment, Christian employers would not be put in the position of needing to make decisions on covering procedures that conflict with their beliefs.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>So let’s evaluate these against the five-principle framework.</p>
<p><em>1. Is it good for the poor?</em></p>
<p>Well, yeah, on principle free exercise of religion is good for everybody, including the poor.</p>
<p><em>2. Is it good for the planet?</em></p>
<p>Same answer.</p>
<p><em>3. Does it promote peace?</em></p>
<p>A focus on true religious tolerance would indeed help promote peace.</p>
<p><em>4. Does it challenge the powerful?</em> <em>5. Does it let the marginalized have a seat at the table to speak for themselves?</em></p>
<p>If we follow the line of thinking that free exercise and free speech are rights that properly belong to individuals and not all corporations, then yes, it would be a challenge to the powerful.</p>

<p>The trouble with the incessant deconstruction at work within progressive Christianity is that, left unchecked, all it tends to produce are agnostic Democrats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong words from one of my favorites, <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2018/01/journal-week-3-losing-interest-in.html">Richard Beck</a>, this morning. Beck observes that the continual deconstruction of progressive Christianity doesn&rsquo;t necessarily end, well, Christianly. And he does so in his typical relaxed fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remain very sympathetic to progressive Christianity. But a Christianity that doesn&rsquo;t believe in anything&ndash;a Christianity that dilutes and dilutes and dilutes until you have a &ldquo;Church of Christ Without Christ&rdquo;&ndash;that Christianity just doesn&rsquo;t interest me anymore. I&rsquo;ve made a long and hard journey carrying my doubts, and now I&rsquo;m just bored by them.</p>

<p><em>The Punch Escrow</em> is a sci-fi thriller that takes one reasonable conceit and runs with it to great effect. A really fun novel to close out the year.</p>

<li><em>Nevertheless: A Memoir</em> - Alec Baldwin</li>
</ul>
<p>I started off the year with a bang reading Ibram X. Kendi&rsquo;s <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em>. Stunning writing about the history of racism in America. So much that we as middle-class white Americans aren&rsquo;t familiar with. But the one that will likely stick with me even more and provoke some re-reads came late in the year: Alan Jacobs' <em>How to Think</em>. In this time of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and incessant online argument, Jacobs provides some much-needed sanity and advice.</p>
<h3 id="theology">Theology</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>How to Survive a Shipwreck</em> - Jonathan Martin</li>
<li><em>Introduction to the Old Testament</em> - J. Alberto Soggin</li>
<li><em>The Day the Revolution Began: Reconsidering the Meaning of Jesus&rsquo;s Crucifixion</em> - N.T. Wright</li>
<li><em>Faithful Presence: Seven Disciplines that Shape the Church for Mission</em> - David E. Fitch</li>
<li><em>Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life</em> - Tish Harrison Warren</li>
<li><em>The Imperfect Disciple: Grace for People Who Can&rsquo;t Get Their Act Together</em> - Jared C. Wilson</li>
<li><em>People to Be Loved: Why Homosexuality Is Not Just an Issue</em> - Preston Sprinkle</li>
<li><strong><em>The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?</em> - David Bentley Hart</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony</em> - Richard Bauckham</strong></li>
<li><em>A People&rsquo;s History of Christianity: The Other Side of the Story</em> - Diana Butler Bass</li>
<li><em>The Art of Curating Worship: Reshaping the Role of Worship Leader</em> - Mark Pierson</li>
<li><em>Sinners in the Hands of a Loving God: The Scandalous Truth of the Very Good News</em> - Brian Zahnd</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Jesus and the Eyewitnesses</em> by Richard Bauckham will permanently change how I read the Gospels. His case that most people named by name in the Gospels were specifically named because they were known eyewitnesses puts the accounts in a new light.</p>
<p>And I had heard good stuff about D.B. Hart&rsquo;s little volume <em>The Doors of the Sea</em> for a long time but just never gotten to it. In it he uses the Boxing Day Tsunami of 2004 to frame his response to the age-old question of how a good, omnipotent God can allow such evil and suffering. My theological upbringing has been pretty Calvinist, but Hart&rsquo;s very non-Calvinist approach (he&rsquo;s Orthodox) provided a more compelling and beautiful explanation than anything I&rsquo;ve previously read.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>On the whole, I feel like I got a lot of variety this year and read a lot of interesting books. I do have a handful that I started and for some reason bogged down in and need to come back to - Greg Boyd&rsquo;s <em>Crucifixion of the Warrior God</em> is on that list&hellip; to be picked up sometime soon.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in November I decided it was time for a <a href="/17/11/a-social-media-fast/">social media break</a>. Facebook and Twitter were turning into frustrations that caused me more to feel fractured than to be too helpful. So I deleted the apps from my phone, closed the usually-open tabs in my browser, and decided to abstain until Christmas.</p>
<p>There were a few things I was afraid I’d miss - things that had dissuaded me from doing a fast like this before now - chiefly updates and photos from family members on Facebook, and staying in touch with a handful of friends for whom Twitter is our primary communication means. But for a month, it was definitely time to give it a try.</p>
<p>A month later it turns out that I didn’t miss all that much. Yeah, there were a few pictures from family members. I was able to catch up with those pretty quickly. The biggest miss was indeed the Twitter friends. There were a handful of times when I had the itch to post something to Twitter or FB and felt like I had no place to put it&hellip; but then I remembered my blog.</p>
<p>There were some unexpected positive aspects to the fast. Within the first few days I got text messages from friends who never otherwise text me. That was fun. And I spent some more time actually writing stuff on my blog. I kicked off <a href="/17/12/thinking-in-more-positive-terms-about-political-issues/">a topic series</a> that could eat up far more time than I have to actually do it justice. And for family pictures I set up an iMessage thread with my parents and all my siblings and it’s been a lot of fun, too.</p>
<p>On December 26th I reinstalled Tweetbot on my phone. My first step was to unfollow a lot of accounts. I had been following nearly 600; I cut out nearly half of them, trying to retain only real people I know personally or through one of my online communities. I may still need to cut down a few more noisy accounts, but it’s a little easier to tolerate being a Twitter completionist when I pull it up after a few hours’ break and there are only a hundred or so tweets to read through.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I really want to get back on to Facebook. I will stick around the Christ and Pop Culture group at least, but if it were to have a separate platform (which it won’t, for reasons that I understand), I would probably just jettison FB altogether.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> want to spend more time writing on my blog - something that seems far more productive than being endlessly distracted by social media. Hopefully this taste of social media absence will help me set more reasonable levels of interaction in 2018.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well I&rsquo;m not ready to jump into one of the big ugly topics yet, so maybe this one will be a little easier. (Maybe.) Let&rsquo;s talk about the internet and overall technology policies.</p>
<h3 id="access--control-of-internet">Access / Control of Internet</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a current debate about a concept called &ldquo;net neutrality&rdquo; that, as typical, is highly spun by both sides on the issue. So I&rsquo;m going to avoid that term in my discussion. I&rsquo;ll try to make this one fairly simple.</p>
<p>Access to the Internet should be thought of and regulated like a public utility, analogous to water, gas, and electric. Market competition is difficult here because the cost for infrastructure development is relatively high and a physical connection is required to each home and business. (We don&rsquo;t expect that we&rsquo;ll have three electric companies run lines to our house so we can choose the one with the best rates!) Pricing should be overseen and controlled just like it is for other utilities. Access to the internet should be unrestricted - no paid &ldquo;fast lanes&rdquo;, no filtering, no blocking.</p>
<p>Once that level of utility access is in place for the internet, I&rsquo;m more open to allowing mobile providers to offer variation and experiment within the market space, because there is more room for genuine competition within the mobile internet (aka cell phone) market.</p>
<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<p>The government should not restrict the use of encryption or push for the inclusion of &ldquo;back doors&rdquo; into encryption systems. From a technical standpoint, if a back door exists, the probability is 100% that at some point the bad guys will figure out how to get through it. The FBI may complain that good encryption slows their investigations down, and may dream up scenarios where they suggest having a backdoor would help avert some impending attack; I don&rsquo;t believe that because we can imagine such a scenario that it justifies crippling our encryption systems. Encryption helps enable the right to digital privacy. We need it.</p>
<h3 id="consumer-data-and-privacy">Consumer Data and Privacy</h3>
<p>Big data analytics, whether by the government or by corporate interests, are affecting our lives in ways we struggle to understand (or are hidden from us). While it&rsquo;s folly to think we can get the genie back in that bottle, I&rsquo;d be interested to explore the idea of a Consumer Data Protection agency similar to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was created after the 2008 financial crisis. We need awareness of what&rsquo;s being done with our personal data, and we need real penalties for companies that mismanage or abuse it.</p>
<h3 id="social-media-transparency">Social Media Transparency</h3>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Facebook. And #FakeNews. And election meddling by way of Facebook propaganda. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;ll take for the giants like Facebook to get serious about trying to patrol that type of obviously fake material - maybe they shouldn&rsquo;t. But what we <em>do</em> need is a populous that is more educated about how to identify fake news stories so they can evaluate things on their own.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>So let’s evaluate these against our five-principle framework.</p>
<p><em>1. Is it good for the poor?</em></p>
<p>When compared with the possibility of pay-for-access, a Net Neutrality position is good for everyone, and benefits the poor who otherwise might be shut out of the benefits that internet access provides.</p>
<p><em>2. Is it good for the planet?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll rate this one as neutral.</p>
<p><em>3. Does it promote peace?</em></p>
<p>The internet can be used for peaceful ends&hellip; or for not so peaceful ends. Better consumer education about how and what to consume would help us learn to ignore propaganda, which would be a positive and usually peaceful improvement.</p>
<p><em>4. Does it challenge the powerful?</em></p>
<p>Net Neutrality and awareness / limitation of big data collection would serve to at least give us awareness of what the powerful are doing with all that information&hellip; and knowledge is the first step toward taking action.</p>
<p><em>5. Does it let the marginalized have a seat at the table to speak for themselves?</em></p>
<p>Free and neutral access to the internet would provide each user, regardless of wealth or status, the same ability to distribute their message as anyone else. While access to already-popular channels isn&rsquo;t automatic, the internet provides more ability than ever before in history for an unknown person with a notable message to spread virally.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/12/11/positive-politics-education.html">Positive Politics: Education</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>None of the topics I&rsquo;ve teed up for my Positive Politics discussions are easy ones, but in the interests of easing into things I&rsquo;ll try to take one that&rsquo;s maybe not super-controversial to start. (Of course, as with anything political, I may be surprised by what becomes controversial.) So let&rsquo;s talk about education. For my own organizational purposes, I&rsquo;m going to break this down into three pieces: early childhood, K-12, and college.</p>
<h3 id="my-background">My Background</h3>
<p>My background is probably relevant here. After attending two different public schools for kindergarten, I was homeschooled as a child from grades 1 - 12. My maternal grandmother spent her entire career as an elementary school teacher. My parents, after some years as public educators, blazed the homeschooling trail when it was not quite and just barely legal. Thanks in large part to their efforts I did well on the college admissions tests, was named a National Merit Scholar, and graduated with an engineering degree from a private university. My wife and I are now on year 8 of homeschooling our three children, which we anticipate continuing with them through their high school years.</p>
<h3 id="early-childhood-education">Early Childhood Education</h3>
<p>Gone are the days when we could expect that preschool-age children would be cared for by a parent at home. Our modern society is nearly based on the assumption that even if both parents are present in the home - that itself a less frequent condition than it used to be - that both parents are working outside the home to make ends meet. For those with means, children may be left in educational day-care facilities and preschools, but poorer children may more usually get left in a less beneficial environment. <a href="http://www.nea.org/home/18226.htm">Research shows us</a> that these early years are critical to a child&rsquo;s intellectual and emotional formation.</p>
<p>So what should we do? I suggest that the government should fund early childhood education opportunities. These need not be mandatory - parents should be welcome to choose their own option such as a stay-at-home parent, family member, or private setting - but it should be available for those who would need and use it. Yes, these programs would cost money, but as an investment in the good of those individual children and in society as a whole, they would be a wise choice.</p>
<h3 id="k-12-education">K-12 Education</h3>
<p>When compared with the benefit they provide society, I believe teachers are one of the most underpaid groups of workers in America. We require advanced college degrees, often expect that to a great extent the teachers will self-supply their classrooms, and then pay them a barely middle-class salary. I guess then I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised - just appreciative - when I see so many teachers with such strong altruistic desire to teach. Why else would they do it?</p>
<p>I suggest that we should significantly increase our commitment to public education, while allowing alternative options with appropriate safeguards in place. We should pay teachers at a rate more commensurate with other professional career paths and should fund associated school programs similarly. While I think local control and direction of the school system is important, schools should be funded from a broader pool - say, at the state level rather than the municipal level - so that we don&rsquo;t forever build bigger and bigger rich suburban schools while having no funding available for poor districts.</p>
<p>Alternative options such as home schools and private schools should be allowed, but I&rsquo;m skeptical of the case for routing funds to those schools via things like voucher programs. While on the face of the argument, vouchers seem like a reasonable idea - pay for results, regardless of where the results come from - the metrics make it very tricky. The example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act">No Child Left Behind Act</a> over the past 15 years should be enough for us to seriously consider whether we really want to couple educational funding to test-based outcomes. Should assessment tests be a part of an overall institutional evaluation? You bet. But funding contingent on those specific outcomes is problematic. Metrics are tricky things - design the wrong one and you get the wrong behavior.</p>
<h3 id="college-education">College education</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably a whole separate post to be written on this topic, but I&rsquo;ll try to restrain myself. I see two primary problems with our higher education system at present: first, that the costs are increasing exponentially, resulting in college graduates with huge piles of debt; second, that a college diploma is considered nearly a <em>de facto</em> requirement for most jobs.</p>
<p>My grades and test scores helped when I went to college in the mid-90&rsquo;s. I passed up several full-ride scholarship offers at public universities to attend a private school that offered more minimal scholarships. After graduating in four years, I still had enough college debt that I was writing significant checks every month for 10 years to pay it off. Now 20 years later, the College Board reports that, even adjusted for inflation, <a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-fees-room-and-board-over-time">public school tuition and fees have more than doubled</a> since I was in college. I&rsquo;ll guarantee you that inflation-adjusted salaries for parents and students haven&rsquo;t doubled accordingly! The result: even more debt for students and parents.</p>
<p>Unemployment rates make the story clear: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/unemployment-rate-2-point-5-percent-for-college-grads-7-point-7-percent-for-high-school-dropouts-january-2017.htm">for college graduates, the unemployment rate is nearly zero</a>. (2.5% in January 2017, which is in practice full employment.) For high school graduates, unemployment is more than twice that - 5.3% - and for high-school dropouts, the unemployment rate nears 8%. So the most job opportunities would seem to be available for those who have a four-year diploma. But need this really be the case? Sure, in some disciplines a significant professional education is a must. (I&rsquo;d like the guy designing my bridge or the woman operating on my heart to have the best education they can get!) But many blue collar and even white collar job fields shouldn&rsquo;t require four or five years and a mound of debt just to buy entry to the field. <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/top_performers/2012/01/the_death_of_vocational_education_and_the_demise_of_the_american_middle_class.html">Vocational training programs</a> should be developed and encouraged for job areas that can reasonably be done without a four-year degree.</p>
<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>So let&rsquo;s evaluate these against our five-principle framework.</p>
<p><em>1. Is it good for the poor?</em></p>
<p>Increased funding for the education system, with funding spread more broadly, should work to help improve education for the poor.</p>
<p><em>2. Is it good for the planet?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the education system has a direct ecological impact - other than that ecological education could be part of a well-balanced system.</p>
<p><em>3. Does it promote peace?</em></p>
<p>Similar answer as to #2, though I would add here that education practices that lead to more diversity in our school populations should in the long term encourage more tolerance among diverse groups, which should promote peace.</p>
<p><em>4. Does it challenge the powerful? 5. Does it let the marginalized have a seat at the table to speak for themselves?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what all powerful groups need to be challenged in this area, but I would hope that the combination of more broad-pool funding combined with local control would help restrain more impersonal national forces in favor of more accessible local ones, and would empower even those in poor districts to make decisions that are beneficial for their children and communities.</p>

			 <p>I miss Andrew Sullivan. I&rsquo;m glad the guy detached a bit - the pace of his daily blogging was incredible, no surprise it wasn&rsquo;t sustainable - but he has a unique and important voice on issues of our time. So it was no surprise to me that his weekly column addressing the Gay Wedding Cake case is a must read.</p>
<p>I find myself pretty much in alignment with Andrew&rsquo;s conflicted take. I&rsquo;d highly recommend reading <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/12/andrew-sullivan-let-him-have-his-cake.html">the whole thing</a> - it&rsquo;s not too long - but I&rsquo;ll quote just one pithy paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, if the liberals were more liberal, and the Christians more Christian, this case would never have existed. It tells you a great deal about the decadence of our culture that it does.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/12/07/positive-politics-a.html">Positive politics: a little bit of foundation</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/12/07/positive-politics-a.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-12-07 17:00:52 -0500">Dec 7, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Before I start in on specific political topics, I want to lay out some foundation that will lie under the specifics.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I&rsquo;m a Christian, so my approach is necessarily rooted in Christian values and a belief that the Bible gives us God&rsquo;s direction for what is best for human flourishing.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, the Bible provides very little direct instruction on what a government should look like other than some basics like punishing evil, encouraging good, being righteous and just. There has been a lot of teaching and assumption in the American evangelical church over the past 40 years that &ldquo;Christian values&rdquo; are closely aligned with Republican party positions. I&rsquo;m going to challenge that assumption while hopefully not irrationally rebelling against it.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, politics is the art of the possible, and inherent in good politics is compromise. If all stakeholders are a little bit happy and a little bit unhappy with an outcome, it&rsquo;s probably a good result from a political viewpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I believe that tolerance and freedom are values that should be promoted in our society. While I am a Christian, I do not believe that the best government would promote the Christian faith over other faiths. This includes not compelling uniquely Christian rules or practices simply because they are Christian. The government should foster a society that encourages the flourishing of all its members, regardless of their faith.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, while I would hope the evaluation framework I&rsquo;m borrowing from Brian Zahnd (as amended by my friend Misty Granade) is rather self-evidently good, I&rsquo;d like to briefly outline my justification for each principle.</p>
<p><em>1. Is it good for the poor?</em></p>
<p>God cares deeply for the plight of the poor, as is demonstrated across the full sweep of Scripture. Old Testament laws command farmers to leave food on the edges of their field for the poor to glean and define jubilees that revert bought/sold property wealth. The New Testament gives instruction to provide for the poor and examples of offerings being taken up for them. This one seems pretty clear.</p>
<p><em>2. Is it good for the planet?</em></p>
<p>God is the creator. The earth displays His handiwork. Man&rsquo;s first task is to care for the garden in which he was placed. God&rsquo;s ultimate plan is for restoration of all things, including creation. In the same way the government should promote human flourishing, it should also promote the flourishing of all creation.</p>
<p><em>3. Does it promote peace?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to hope this one is self-evident. While peace is not always possible, it is always the goal.</p>
<p><em>4. Does it challenge the powerful?</em> <em>5. Does it let the marginalized have a seat at the table to speak for themselves?</em></p>
<p>These two are closely related. It&rsquo;s a given that there will always be power imbalances, and this isn&rsquo;t inherently wrong or unreasonable. But power corrupts. Look at any government and you&rsquo;ll see too many in power who are using that power not as good stewards promoting general flourishing but instead as selfish stewards out for their own gain.</p>
<p>James Madison summed it up brilliantly in <a href="http://constitution.org/fed/federa51.htm">Federalist #51</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, having systems designed to challenge the powerful and let the marginalized have a voice are good because they put an elements of self-regulation into the system.</p>
<p><strong>Onward!</strong></p>
<p>With that set of background and caveats in place, I think it&rsquo;s time to start writing on specific topics.</p>

			 <p><img src="/images/2017/politics-150x150.jpg" alt="">From time to time over the past year when I&rsquo;ve been tempted to write political rage posts, it has seemed to me that even though they&rsquo;d be cathartic, that wouldn&rsquo;t be all that constructive. And while I haven&rsquo;t studied political theory or public policy much, writing helps me work through my thinking on issues. So, my thought goes, maybe I should spend some time thinking through and writing constructive opinions on various political topics.</p>
<p>Then I came across this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianZahnd/">Brian Zahnd</a> (this was before my social media fast, honest!) that seems like a good framework to work from:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BrianZahnd/status/934181592607715329">twitter.com/BrianZahn&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Off the top of my head, some topics I&rsquo;d like to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxation</li>
<li>Religious Liberty</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Gun control</li>
<li>Foreign trade policy</li>
<li>Foreign military presence</li>
<li>Middle East policy / terrorism</li>
<li>Racial justice issues</li>
<li>Social programs / social safety net</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Internet / technology policy</li>
<li>Campaign finance</li>
<li>Term limits</li>
<li>Science &amp; space</li>
<li>Environmental issues</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not working through this all to get Brian Zahnd&rsquo;s vote - I&rsquo;d need to run for office first! But it might be constructive to think positively about what policy should be instead of just saying &ldquo;well, <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a bad idea&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Some really <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2017/11/jesus-and-wesleyan-quadrilateral.html">fascinating thoughts from Richard Beck this morning</a> on Jesus' appeal to human emotion and reasoning as a part of His teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus also used human experience as a hermeneutical and theological tool. In Matthew 12 Jesus enters a synagogue on the Sabbath and finds a man with a withered hand. The way the Pharisees interpreted the Sabbath laws prohibited Jesus from healing the man. But Jesus disagrees, and he makes an appeal to human experience to argue for a different hermeneutical approach to Sabbath keeping. Jesus doesn&rsquo;t appeal to Scripture or tradition, he asks a question about how something would feel. &ldquo;How many of you,&rdquo; Jesus asks, &ldquo;if a sheep of yours fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn&rsquo;t pull it out?&rdquo; Jesus asks the Pharisees <em>to imaginatively place themselves in this situation</em>, asking them to consult their feelings, experiences and reactions. Jesus expects this appeal to experience to lead to an affirmative answer: They would grab the sheep out of the ditch, even on the Sabbath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This intrigues me. The conservative circles I inhabit are fond of dismissing claims to human emotion and reason as a hermeneutical tool. (Or at least when that emotion and reason doesn&rsquo;t challenge the conclusions of the existing theological framework.) If we are totally depraved, the reasoning goes, our emotions and reasoning are also totally depraved and therefore untrustworthy.</p>
<p>I tend to think that our intrinsic moral reactions, while fallen, still hold the echoes of what it means to have been created in the image of God, and as such, they shouldn&rsquo;t be easily dismissed. Beck gives me another angle here to consider that thought.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/11/28/a-social-media.html">A Social Media Fast</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The holidays aren&rsquo;t typically a time we think of fasting&hellip; but it was time. I&rsquo;ve been a perpetual user of social media for just about as long as that media has existed. I had an account on Facebook they day they opened it up to more than just college students. I was an early adopter and evangelist of Twitter, and while I don&rsquo;t tweet as much as some people do (maybe 32k tweets in 10 years&hellip; which is still 10 a day, I guess) I&rsquo;ve had a Tweetdeck window perpetually on my computer desktop and Tweetbot on the front page of my iPhone.</p>
<p>But social media has been wearing on me this year. I&rsquo;m sure our current political situation hasn&rsquo;t been helping. Twitter seems mostly to be about immediate response and angst these days, and while it&rsquo;s helped propel some valuable trends (#MeToo comes to mind), it got exhausting feeling like I needed to keep up. For a while I thought I was doing good things by posting strong opinions on Facebook. Eventually I think though everybody that might&rsquo;ve disagreed (who I was hoping I would reach) likely unfollowed me or the news sources I was sharing. And so it became mostly just an echo chamber. So Monday morning I closed my Twitter and Facebook tabs, deleted the Facebook and Twitter apps from my phone, and decided it was time for a fast.</p>
<p>This decision is not without trepidation. I&rsquo;ve had many social media relationships turn into real friendships over the past decade, and many local friendships enhanced by the online communication. I&rsquo;d hate to lose that. (I am keeping Slack installed, which provides a lower-intensity communication path to several of my closest friends.) Maybe after a detox I&rsquo;ll be able to find healthier ways to get my fix of online debate and pictures of the nieces and nephew without feeling tied to it.</p>
<p>So in the mean time, if I have something I want to post, it&rsquo;s going to go here on my blog instead of Facebook or Twitter. The blog will automatically cross-post to those services, but I won&rsquo;t be responding there. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes. Mainly I need less mental distractions&hellip; and these are the ones that need to go. Here&rsquo;s hoping.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The familiarity of yesterday&rsquo;s breaking news alerts almost muted the shock. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/06/us/texas-church-shooting/index.html">Half a church dead, the other half wounded.</a> I&rsquo;m old enough to remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby%27s_shooting">the Luby&rsquo;s shooting</a>, which at the time was nearly unimaginable. And we can name the shootings that followed in the next 25 years in a horrific litany: Columbine. Sandy Hook Elementary. Virginia Tech. San Bernardino. Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston. The Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Las Vegas. And now, hardly before the crime tape was down in Vegas: First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs.</p>
<p>The online response comes in three stages and is by this point, sadly, completely predictable:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1: Thoughts and Prayers</strong> House Speaker Paul Ryan called for prayers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Same <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/927252030200172544">from Texas Governor Greg Abbott</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/SenateMajLdr/status/927281471810916352">from Senate Majority Leader McConnell</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson/status/927298874011734016">from the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee</a>. And <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorLankford/status/927296739731755008">on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorFischer/status/927293995541295104">on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RepComstock/status/927336600236904453">on</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2: The Backlash</strong> These range from the political from Senator Elizabeth Warren:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>to the full on blast furnace from Wil Wheaton,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(who <a href="https://twitter.com/wilw/status/927303064863645696">later tempered his remarks</a> just a bit.)</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3: The Persecution Complex</strong></p>
<p>Christians, offended by the anger against the expression of prayers, start feeling put upon. Such as this example from <em>First Things</em> editor Matthew Schmitz:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And so it goes, back and forth, until the shooting passes from the news cycle either by natural decay or by the violence of yet another tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>I have sympathies on both sides of this one.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian. God tells us to pray. I believe that prayer is effective. I&rsquo;ve seen it work. Sometimes we pray and God works in direct, miraculous ways. But other times (and in my own limited experience, the majority of the time) we pray, and God works <em>through</em> someone else. Sometimes God even uses us to work out the answer to our own prayers. So I want to be sympathetic with the prayers of Christian political leaders. They go up with my own.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also sympathetic with the ragers. Wil Wheaton is no Christian. I don&rsquo;t expect him to believe that prayer is effective. I think he&rsquo;s angry with Christians like Paul Ryan not because they&rsquo;re praying, but because <em>they don&rsquo;t seem to be doing anything else</em>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think legislation is the 100% solution to gun violence, but Republican leaders could push for real changes that <em>would</em> help things. To proclaim that you&rsquo;re praying but then not do whatever else is within your power to address the issue is hypocrisy. And that&rsquo;s reason enough to anger believers and unbelievers alike.</p>
<p>And to those who immediately start feeling hurt that people are criticizing the church? Maybe it&rsquo;s time to take a hard look in the mirror. Maybe we deserve that criticism. Maybe we should provide them examples of Christians who are praying and also acting.</p>
<p>As I am finishing up this post, Tyler Huckabee has a twitter thread that captures this a lot more pithily than I have. Here&rsquo;s how he brings it home:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;ll preach.</p>

			 <p>Two weeks, two business trips, it was time for light reading. Trolling the fiction shelves found me these:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2z4tPqo"><em>Price of Duty</em> by Dale Brown</a></strong></p>
<p>Dale Brown has managed to crank out 21 books in the Patrick McLanahan series over the past 30 years. I&rsquo;ve read far too many of them. They crossed the line into ridiculousness several books back&hellip; and this one is no different. This one reads more like the script for a direct-to-video action movie (a genre, I fear, that has been killed off by Netflix!) than a proper novel.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xJw9BM"><em>Tom Clancy - Point of Contact</em> by Mike Maden</a></strong></p>
<p>Tom Clancy is long dead and buried but his name and book series lives on. According to Amazon, this book is &ldquo;Jack Ryan Universe book #23&rdquo;, which is roughly the same output as Dale Brown&rsquo;s series in roughly the same timeframe. This one was thin enough that, writing this post a couple weeks after finishing the book, I have exactly zero recollection of what this one was about.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2iR6t3m"><em>The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O.</em> by Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland</a></strong></p>
<p>Now <em>this</em> one was worth my time. While it starts out seeming to be about &lsquo;the return of magic&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s much more an adventure in time travel combined with some humorous observations about how bureaucracy can take over and ruin even the best ideas. I had a lot of fun here.</p>

Episode 3 is his discussion with musician, producer, and composer <a href="https://twitter.com/donchaffer">Don Chaffer</a>. Toward the end of the interview, Don talks about how he&rsquo;s started writing for musical theater, and how it provides an outlet that he needs as a 40-ish father and husband.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;when you have kids in particular you just give and give and give and give. And one day you wake up and you&rsquo;re like &lsquo;what do I get, what&rsquo;s my part in this thing? Because I used to do a lot of stuff I liked&hellip; sometimes I would go out to eat or watch a movie! That was crazy!&rsquo;. I told a monk friend of mine one time, he said &lsquo;tell me everything&rsquo;. And I said &lsquo;well I feel like between family and work I&rsquo;ve got nothing left.&rsquo; And he said &ldquo;yeah! and a hundred years ago you&rsquo;d be dead by now, too.&rdquo; So, there&rsquo;s just something about this phase of life, it&rsquo;s just - he&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;people died at that point just because they were too pooped to keep living&rsquo;. And I feel like - so that&rsquo;s what a mid-life crisis is. You hit these limitations and you think &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather have, you know, a Corvette and a hot blonde with a boob job. And so you do these crazy stupid things, blow up your whole life. And it&rsquo;s like &ndash; one of the jokes I&rsquo;ve made is that my mid-life crisis was music theater instead of hookers and blow. But it&rsquo;s true. I think that it became - one of the things I realized is that you find a healthy outlet to give yourself some space, to do some things you enjoy. Because that&rsquo;s important. You can&rsquo;t live on only sacrifice. It ends up being a negation. While love and sacrificial love are endless, hypothetically, they aren&rsquo;t for a human, right? They&rsquo;re only endless because they come from somewhere else. There&rsquo;s some point you kinda run yourself out and you realize &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have infinite capacity here to be a loving husband and father. I&rsquo;ve gotta do something for myself.&rsquo; The other piece of it for a marriage is to try to invite each other into it together. Not necessarily doing the same things, because usually that isn&rsquo;t going to help - you need space from each other - but invite each other into that headspace of like, &lsquo;do some things for yourself. I&rsquo;ll do some things for myself. We&rsquo;ll get a babysitter if we can afford it. Or swap. I&rsquo;ll take the kids tonight, you take them on Wednesday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I resonate with that more than I&rsquo;d like to admit many days. (I bet my wife does, too.)</p>

			 <p>A rundown of recent book completions:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2yBvPsR"><em>A People&rsquo;s History of Christianity: The Other Side of the Story</em></a> by Diana Butler Bass</strong></p>
<p>Bass is clearly giving a nod to Zinn&rsquo;s <em>People&rsquo;s History of the United States</em> with her title and approach. It&rsquo;s not a bad effort, but nothing really earth-shattering, either.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xtRIFe"><em>The Art of Curating Worship: Reshaping the Role of Worship Leader</em></a> by Mark Pierson</strong></p>
<p>Pierson is an Australian who was writing from a very strong emergent perspective. While the worship experiences he describes are a long way from what would work in my midwestern US church, his perspective on the intent of and attitude toward leading worship was right on and gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xsJ7Yh"><em>Khrushchev: The Man and His Era</em></a> by William Taubman</strong></p>
<p>A very readable biography of the Soviet leader. Still hard to get a grasp on how someone can be so human and yet so depraved.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2yAB1gi"><em>Parable of the Sower</em></a> by Octavia E. Butler</strong></p>
<p>This was the first I&rsquo;ve read of Butler. Won&rsquo;t be the last. A wonderful voice in dystopian fiction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xtHZiq"><em>Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness</em></a> by Edward Kaplan</strong></p>
<p>The first of two volumes of biography of a fascinating Jewish thinker from the early 20th century. Now I&rsquo;ve gotta get volume two.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xtPru1"><em>The Switch</em></a> by Joseph Finder</strong></p>
<p>I was wanting mindless entertainment, and this book overachieved at that. By which I mean it was even more mindless and boring than I was hoping for. Meh.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last Sunday night I had the privilege of attending an Andrew Peterson-organized and -led concert honoring the legacy of Rich Mullins at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Peterson and his cadre are roughly my age, and we share a deep debt to Mullins, who in his all-too-short musical career penned songs that showed that Christian music could be artistic, poetic, and honest in ways we hadn&rsquo;t before seen. (Andrew wrote an essay for the concert booklet telling his Rich Mullins story that&rsquo;s well worth a read. <a href="http://rabbitroom.com/2017/09/a-legacy-of-love-my-rich-mullins-story/">It&rsquo;s posted on The Rabbit Room.</a>)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This year is the 20th anniversary of Mullins' death in a car accident, and served as an opportunity for Peterson to round up his friends and prepare the music. The Ryman was packed to capacity with an audience that clearly loves Rich&rsquo;s music just as much as the musicians themselves do; the concert was punctuated with opportunities for the audience to sing along, starting from an impromptu acapella chorus of &ldquo;Awesome God&rdquo;, which Peterson led &ldquo;just to get it out of the way&rdquo;. (While it&rsquo;s perhaps Mullins' best known song to the general public, it&rsquo;s certainly not his favorite among his more devoted fans.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Peterson and friends followed a concert format that he has perfected over years of touring his Behold The Lamb of God Christmas tour. The first half of the concert rotated in each of the guest artists to sing a Mullins song of their choice, with AP sneaking a few of his own choices in along the way.</p>
<p>When we hit intermission I told my wife that I couldn&rsquo;t think of another Rich song that I was disappointed that they hadn&rsquo;t played in the first half. The set list:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Awesome God&rdquo; - AP</li>
<li>&ldquo;Calling Out Your Name&rdquo; - AP</li>
<li>&ldquo;Boy Like Me/Man Like You&rdquo; - AP</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hard to Get&rdquo; - Andy Gullahorn</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cry The Name&rdquo; - Jill Phillips</li>
<li>&ldquo;What Susan Said&rdquo; - Andrew Osenga</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Howling&rdquo; - Jeremy Casella</li>
<li>&ldquo;Screen Door&rdquo; (complete w/ cups) - Brandon Heath &amp; Mitch McVicker</li>
<li>&ldquo;You Did Not Have A Home&rdquo; - Finnegan Bell</li>
<li>&ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; - Matt Giraud</li>
<li>&ldquo;Buenos Noches from Nacogdoches&rdquo; - Leigh Nash</li>
<li>&ldquo;Bound to Come Some Trouble&rdquo; - Mitch McVicker</li>
<li>&ldquo;If I Stand&rdquo; - AP</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second half of the concert brought each of those artists back out in turn to perform note-for-note versions of each song from Rich&rsquo;s masterpiece <em>A Liturgy, A Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band</em>. A string section played the original string charts as provided by Rich&rsquo;s producer Reed Arvin (who himself was present and played the piano on &ldquo;Creed&rdquo; midway through the second half).</p>
<p>To my critical ear they were indeed almost exactly note-for-note and lick-for-lick. Gabe Scott had his hammered dulcimer skills tested and found awesome. My specific criteria for this evaluation was the little turn from the second verse into the pre-chorus of &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; - there&rsquo;s a drum fill, a bass slide, and a little guitar riff that come together in a sublime little moment that I&rsquo;m probably the only person in the world who cares about. They nailed it. The only place they diverged was I think they gave Andy Osenga an extra couple choruses to play a smoking guitar solo on the end of &ldquo;How To Grow Up Big and Strong&rdquo;&hellip; but ain&rsquo;t nobody gonna complain about that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second half setlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Here In America&rdquo; - AP</li>
<li>&ldquo;Isaiah 52:10&rdquo; - Jill Phillips</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Color Green&rdquo; - AP</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hold Me Jesus&rdquo; - Brandon Heath</li>
<li>&ldquo;Creed&rdquo; - AP, Andy Gullahorn, and Jill Phillips</li>
<li>&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; - Andy Gullahorn</li>
<li>&ldquo;78 Eatonwood Green&rdquo; - Gabe Scott on the hammered dulcimer</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hard&rdquo; - Finnegan Bell</li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Carry On&rdquo; - Jeremy Casella</li>
<li>&ldquo;You Gotta Get Up&rdquo; - Leigh Nash</li>
<li>&ldquo;How To Grow Up Big and Strong&rdquo; - Andrew Osenga</li>
<li>&ldquo;Land of My Sojourn&rdquo; - AP</li>
</ul>
<p>Even they they weren&rsquo;t quite done. Peterson brought the full cast of musicians out and led the (now standing) audience in &ldquo;Step By Step&rdquo; (with guest vocals by Peterson&rsquo;s daughter Skye) and the call-and-response of &ldquo;I See You&rdquo;, which itself leads back in to one final chorus of &ldquo;Step By Step&rdquo;. After some final applause, Peterson did his trademark exit, singing the first line of the Doxology, and then exiting the stage as the audience finished singing it. (1200 people singing the Doxology in the old Ryman auditorium: chills.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hearing so many of Rich&rsquo;s songs in one sitting highlighted both the artistry and prophetic nature of his lyrics. For instance, the last few lines from &ldquo;Hard&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a good midwestern boy<br>
I give an honest day&rsquo;s work when I can get it<br>
I don&rsquo;t cheat on my taxes, I don&rsquo;t cheat on my girl<br>
I&rsquo;ve got values that would make the White House jealous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peterson wondered aloud (perhaps just as much as he dared) whether Rich had any idea those words would still resonate so loudly 25 years after he wrote them. But the lines that stood out even more loudly to me were from &ldquo;Land of My Sojourn&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the lady in the harbor<br>
She still holds her torch out<br>
To those huddled masses who are<br>
Yearning for a freedom that still eludes them<br>
The immigrant&rsquo;s children see their brightest dreams shattered<br>
Here on the New Jersey shoreline in the<br>
Greed and the glitter of those high-tech casinos<br>
Some mendicants wander off into a cathedral<br>
And they stoop in the silence<br>
And there their prayers are still whispered<br>
And I&rsquo;ll sing their song, and I&rsquo;ll sing their song<br>
In the land of my sojourn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The list of concerts I&rsquo;ve attended isn&rsquo;t as long as I&rsquo;d like - and shorter thanks to the U2 concert in St. Louis getting cancelled last weekend - but Sunday night at the Ryman has to be right up there at the top of the list. Peterson posted on Facebook the next day that it might have been his favorite concert ever. I&rsquo;d be inclined to agree with him.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/08/30/liberty-and-holiness.html">Liberty and Holiness</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/08/30/liberty-and-holiness.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-08-30 15:15:32 -0500">Aug 30, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a Facebook discussion recently on a mildly contentious topic, a friend brought out a line of argument that has me ruminating. Here&rsquo;s what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there is a lot to be said for the liberty we Christians have to partake of things, but there are certainly things the world has devised that are inherently unpleasing to God in any form. The question is - are we certain enough - do we have enough firm evidence that these [disputable] practices discussed above are absolutely <em>not</em> going to offend God that we can participate in them with a clean conscience? I know this - I have been bought with a very high price - the blood of Christ, and all too often, I do not reflect that in my conduct, but I should. I hope that we all are moved by that high price to think not of how far out to the boundaries of God&rsquo;s permission we can roam in our conduct, but how near to Christ we can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a familiar argument in many ways. (How many times have I heard this as the preferred answer to lusting teens asking &ldquo;how far is too far?&rdquo;!) And indeed, it seems almost foolhardy to try to argue against the &ldquo;how near to Christ can you get?&rdquo; position. But on this question of liberty and holiness I think we could frame things up a little differently.</p>
<p>First, liberty and holiness are not two ends of the same spectrum. Here we need to distinguish between liberty in permissible things and freedom to sin. Freedom to sin using the excuse of abundant grace is clearly out of bounds (Romans 6:1). But liberty in matters of conscience is something different. When Paul instructs the Corinthians about meat sacrificed to idols, there is no suggestion that meat is OK, but not eating meat is more holy. There is holiness in exercising liberty.</p>
<p>Second, all good things come from God. &ldquo;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights&hellip;&rdquo; (James 1:17). Paul tells us that &ldquo;God&hellip; richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment&rdquo; (1 Timothy 6:17). God has not called us to be dour ascetics. Rather, he has called us to explore and enjoy His goodness to us in His creation. Which leads me to my last thought.</p>
<p>While I can hardly criticize a desire for holiness, at times I wonder if people may stress this desire to hide an underlying sense of fear or unease: fear of God moving in unexplained ways, fear of the Holy Spirit speaking unexpectedly, fear of seeing things that look like God working outside of the careful boundaries we&rsquo;ve come to expect He should work in. And while we need to be ever sensitive to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading when some particular idea or practice might be truly too far, we can do ourselves a disservice if we approach each experience or opportunity with suspicion instead of expectation. If, for example, the steak from the pagan butcher or the unfamiliar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina"><em>lectio divina</em></a> is partaken with a prayer of expectation and a request for God&rsquo;s blessing, why should we fear it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (Luke 11:11-13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My friend&rsquo;s argument in questionable areas, if I can paraphrase, seems to be that &ldquo;the default answer should be &lsquo;no&rsquo; unless you&rsquo;re really, <em>really</em> sure that it can be &lsquo;yes&rsquo;&rdquo;. What I&rsquo;d like to advocate for, though, is to turn that around; that we can, without fear, start with a default answer of &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, trusting that the Holy Spirit will make clear when the answer should instead be &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve put a post together, but I haven&rsquo;t stopped reading&hellip; recent books:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2wiTnOY"><em>Movies are Prayers: How Films Voice Our Deepest Longings</em></a> by Josh Larsen</strong></p>
<p>Larsen is the co-host of the essential Filmspotting podcast, as well as being an editor at <a href="https://thinkchristian.reframemedia.com/">Think Christian</a>. Larsen explores the overlap of his two interests with an insightful look at how movies can be expressions of prayer. Larsen goes deeper into the theology of prayer than I expected, with insightful results. As also happens when I listen to Filmspotting, I came away from <em>Movies are Prayers</em> with a bunch of movies to add to my to-watch list.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2wiEkoA"><em>Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony</em></a> by Richard Bauckham</strong></p>
<p>Bauckham explores the Gospels and makes the case that their content was primarily from eyewitness testimony. He spends quite a bit of time exploring how oral histories were passed down through various cultures, and how the gospels bear many of the hallmarks of such oral tradition based on eyewitness information. He also suggests that part of the reason some characters (including some very minor characters) are explicitly named in the Gospels is because they were known living people who could be referenced as eyewitnesses. (What a fascinating thought!) This definitely gives me a new perspective when reading the Gospels.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xrHgj0"><em>The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II</em></a> by Svetlana Alexievich</strong></p>
<p>A winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, Alexievich interviewed hundreds of Soviet women who fought (often as teenage girls) in the Soviet army during WWII. The details are made even more horrific by the narrative telling. War is hell. Terrible, real, and heartbreaking.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2gklmKc"><em>A Colony in A Nation</em></a> by Chris Hayes</strong></p>
<p>A short volume documenting the discrepancy in policing and justice between blacks and whites in America. Not exceptionally surprising after all that I&rsquo;ve read the past couple years, but tragic and infuriating none the less.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2xGBr0o"><em>Getting Religion: Faith, Culture, &amp; Politics from the Age of Eisenhower to the Era of Obama</em></a> by Kenneth L. Woodward</strong></p>
<p>Woodward was the religion editor of Newsweek for decades, in which role he had opportunity to interview many of the major religious figures of the 20th century. A devout Catholic, Woodward provides a measured view of Billy Graham and other early evangelists, the rise of Evangelicalism and its political efforts, the changes in the Catholic church after Vatican II, and the evolution of the Protestant mainline. Woodward&rsquo;s easy prose felt familiar in some way; finally I realized it must be the deft touch of a newsman similar to that of the late Steve Buttry who I read regularly for nearly a decade until his untimely death last year. All told, a good history of religion in America.</p>

			 <p>I write regularly about the books that I have finished reading. What I don&rsquo;t often do is assign blame credit to those who (often unknowingly) prompted me to buy or borrow the books in the first place.</p>
<p>So with this post I will start assigning, with much appreciation, Book Blame. (Because hey, &ldquo;Book Credit&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have the same appealing alliterative ring to it.)</p>
<p>The most recent book to travel from Amazon&rsquo;s warehouse to my to-read pile is <em>A History of Modern Palestine</em> by Ilan Pappe. For this one I have Chuck Pearson (<a href="https://twitter.com/shorterpearson">@ShorterPearson</a>) to thank, via this tweet:</p>

<p>My most recent purchase (still on its way from Amazon to me) is thanks to Kenneth L. Woodward, who in his book <em>Getting Religion</em> recommends <em>Abraham Joshua Heschel: Prophetic Witness</em>, a biography of the 20th century rabbi by Edward Kaplan. Heschel sounded like such a fascinating figure that I couldn&rsquo;t really pass up a used copy of his biography.</p>
<p>If you, dear reader, have books you think I would be interested in, by all means let me know! One day you, too, could be gratefully mentioned in an edition of Book Blame.</p>

			 <p>Nearly a year ago <a href="/16/09/a-little-plastic-surgery-for-the-body-of-christ/">I wrote a post dismayed about a church looking for a part-time Director of Music with almost unbelievable qualifications</a>. Just to recap, they were looking for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Significant musical experience in performing and directing a contemporary band along with experience in songwriting and production. Must be able to incorporate strings, percussion, and other instruments into contemporary-band driven arrangements Ability to work with and train vocalists in singing of parts Ability to incorporate backing tracks and loops into regular Sunday and special services Minimum of bachelor’s degree in music and/or 5 years’ related church or industry experience. <strong>Possessing an MDiv or MA in theology is ideal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that in a part-time, pay commensurate with experience position.</p>
<p>I ran across my old post at random this morning and decided to revisit that church&rsquo;s website to see if they had ever found such a Director of Music.</p>
<p>So far as I can tell, the position remains empty; the <a href="http://paramountchurch.com/employment">job posting is still there</a>, with only one small edit from last year: the &ldquo;Possessing an MDiv or MA in theology&rdquo;, while ideal, was perhaps a lot to ask, so it has been removed.</p>
<p>I wonder how long they&rsquo;ll have to keep looking?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A lovely passage from the conclusion of <a href="http://amzn.to/2uIPaVP"><em>The Doors of the Sea</em></a>, wherein David Bentley Hart addresses the <em>how can a good God allow suffering?</em> question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e Christians are not obliged (and perhaps not even allowed) to look upon the devastation of that day - to look, that is, upon the entire littoral rim of the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal and upper Indian Ocean strewn with tens of thousands of corpses, a third of them children - and to attempt to console ourselves or others with vacuous cant about the ultimate meaning or purpose residing in all that misery. Ours is, after all, a religion of salvation. Our faith is in a God who has come to rescue his creation from the absurdity of sin, the emptiness and waste of death, the forces - whether calculating malevolence or imbecile chance - that shatter living souls; and so we are permitted to hate these things with a perfect hatred. And we are not only permitted but required to believe that cosmic time as we know it, through all the immensity of its geological ages and historical epochs, is only a shadow of true time, and this world only a shadow of the fuller, richer, more substantial, more glorious creation that God intends; and to believe also that all of nature is a shattered mirror of divine beauty, still full of light, but riven by darkness&hellip; When, however, we learn in Christ the nature of our first estate, and the divine destiny to which we are called, we begin to see - more clearly the more we are able to look upon the world with the eye of charity - that there is in all the things of earth a hidden glory waiting to be revealed, more radiant than a million suns, more beautiful than the most generous imagination or most ardent desire can now conceive. Or, rather, it is a glory not entirely hidden: veiled, rather, but shining in and through and upon all things&hellip; At [disastrous] times, to see the goodness indwelling all creation requires a labor of vision that only a faith in Easter can sustain; but it is there, effulgent, unfading, innocent, but languishing in bondage to corruption, groaning in anticipation of a glory yet to be revealed, both a promise of the Kingdom yet to come and a portent of its beauty.</p>

			 <h3 id="the-history">The history:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2v6zlcq"><em>The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris</em></a> by David McCullough</strong></p>
<p>An interesting read about Paris - astonishingly vibrant in the mid-1800s - and the notable Americans who visited or migrated there. McCullough paints a portrait of art, science, and culture flourishing in ways that inspired the visiting Americans. It&rsquo;s not the most engaging book I&rsquo;ve read from McCullough - it particularly seems to drift off in the last third - but it was still an interesting look into a time I was unfamiliar with.</p>
<h3 id="the-sci-fi">The sci-fi:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2hbxIVc"><em>A Closed and Common Orbit</em></a> by Becky Chambers</strong></p>
<p>The follow-up to <em>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</em> which <a href="/17/07/yep-still-reading/">I reviewed earlier</a>. <em>A Closed and Common Orbit</em> follows a sentient Artificial Intelligence program, designed to inhabit and run a spaceship, as it adapts to being in a body and interacting with the world around it in a more limited way. This is a great little book that I had a very hard time putting down.</p>
<h3 id="the-theology">The theology:</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2uIPaVP"><em>The Doors of the Sea</em></a> by David Bentley Hart</strong></p>
<p>This little volume is an expansion of a couple essays that Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart wrote as a response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami">Boxing Day 2004 tsunami</a> that killed hundreds of thousands in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. <em>How could a good and loving God - if such exists - allow such suffering?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been steeped in Calvinist teaching on this sort of question for a couple decades now and always really struggled with it. Hart, certainly no Calvinist, here provides an alternate view: a God so expansive and powerful that He is willing to give His creation autonomy and yet still work through and around their mess to work out His ultimate purpose. This gives us the freedom to truly rage at the brokenness of the world while at the same time hoping for its restoration.</p>
<p>And with apologies to my Reformed brethren who are reading this and itching to provide me with corrections to Hart, in about 50 small pages Hart has drawn for me an answer to the &ldquo;How can a good God allow suffering?&rdquo; question than I&rsquo;ve heard in 20 years of Calvinist teaching. I&rsquo;ll post separately with a couple excerpts.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read Christian authors from time to time who seem to be flirting with Buddhism - I guess I&rsquo;m thinking primarily of Thomas Merton and Richard Rohr - and I&rsquo;ve never really understood the appeal.</p>
<p>Then yesterday while mowing the lawn I listened to <a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/matthieu-ricard-happiness-as-human-flourishing/">Krista Tippett&rsquo;s interview with Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard</a> and was captivated. In an hour discussion (I listen to On Being&rsquo;s unedited versions, always) Ricard shared thought after thought about human flourishing and connectedness and joy and contentment that, with just the tweaking of a few phrases, could&rsquo;ve been directly from Christian teaching.</p>
<p>Now, nobody freak out, I&rsquo;m not off to shave my head buy a robe and become a monk. But if you have a spare hour, this interview was well worth listening to.</p>

			 <p>A few more books I&rsquo;ve completed lately:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2tfZq4H"><em>Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption</em></a> by Bryan Stevenson</strong></p>
<p>Stevenson tells the stories of many death row inmates he has represented over the years. He makes a compelling case that the justice system is broken for many of these people, documenting gross negligence of counsel, biased law enforcement and judicial systems, and abhorrent treatment inside of prisons. While the inmate whose story forms the through line of the book has a positive outcome, many, many do not. Sobering.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2uJuNsz"><em>The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America</em></a> by Richard Rothstein</strong></p>
<p>A workmanlike path through the immense <em>de facto</em> segregation endorsed by the US government in the early part of the 20th century. It is stunning to understand how zoning laws and public financing were used as weapons to ensure that African Americans were kept out of white neighborhoods. America still has a lot of history to own up to.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2vCAgOj"><em>Dreamland: The True Tale of America&rsquo;s Opiate Epidemic</em></a> by Sam Quinones</strong></p>
<p>Completing my bleak trilogy is this account of the rise of OxyContin and heroin addiction over the past decade. The parallels of aggressive heroin marketing by drug producers from one small location in Mexico and the aggressive OxyContin marketing to doctors and patients even after serious concerns were raised about addiction are remarkable. Quite a horror.</p>
<p>OK, so my reading hasn&rsquo;t all been bleak reading on social issues&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2tqSUMo"><em>Walkaway</em></a> by Cory Doctorow</strong></p>
<p>A near-future sci-fi in which Doctorow explores the benefits of a communal maker culture. Interesting ideas, but reminds me a little too much of <a href="/06/01/bookjournal-stranger-in-a-strange-land/">Heinlein</a> - characters having long conversations about the ins and outs of the philosophical position, too much unnecessary sex.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2uJu9LH"><em>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</em></a> by Becky Chambers</strong></p>
<p>Now <em>this</em> is a fun little fantasy novel. Space adventure in a ship with a diverse, multi-species crew. Easy and fun to read. I have the second book in the series on reserve at the library&hellip; any time now, folks.</p>

			 <p>Hey, it&rsquo;s Friday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather is really too nice to be sitting in the office all day today. I might have to do something about that.</li>
<li>My oldest daughter is in the College for Kids program at Coe College this week and next. One of the classes she&rsquo;s taking is Web Design, and I had a proud nerd dad moment when she told me she was ahead of the rest of the class because she already knew some HTML.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s amazing how a shower, shave, some weights at the gym, and it being FRIDAY helps a guy&rsquo;s general outlook.</li>
<li>Reading through Matthew in my reading plan the past couple weeks and I have started highlighting every place that Jesus heals someone. I have green highlights now on almost every page. Setting things right, indeed.</li>
<li>The back-and-forth the past few days over Eugene Peterson&rsquo;s comments regarding homosexuality and gay marriage have been enlightening and saddening. I feel mostly like the big evangelical machine took advantage of an old saint who deserves better treatment. Ugh.</li>
<li>How is it mid-July already?</li>
<li>My friend Lyz wrote <a href="http://therumpus.net/2015/05/my-sisters-legs/">this piece</a> a couple years ago about her sisters and a major car accident. It&rsquo;s a beautiful piece of writing.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been a fairly quiet summer event-wise, but in September Becky and I have tickets for concerts two weekends in a row: U2 in St. Louis, and Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s Rich Mullins tribute concert in Nashville. Now to figure out what we&rsquo;re doing with the kids.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m leading worship this weekend, but apparently I haven&rsquo;t thought much about it yet because the worship leader disaster dreams haven&rsquo;t started yet. Probably tonight.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a lot of pain in this world. Be kind.</li>

			 <p>Summertime seems to make it hard to get through too many, but here are a few more books that I&rsquo;ve finished over the past few weeks&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2u8vNSG"><em>Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich</em></a> by Norman Ohler</strong></p>
<p>Ohler&rsquo;s book is partly a technical explanation of the development of opiates and methamphetamines by German pharmaceutical companies and partly a chronicle of Hitler&rsquo;s descent into the hell of addiction. A stunning picture of horror and madness.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2tcTYTP"><em>The Imperfect Disciple: Grace for People Who Can&rsquo;t Get Their Act Together</em></a> by Jared C. Wilson</strong></p>
<p>A beautiful little volume that calls readers back to the spiritual disciplines in a way that is gracious and encouraging.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2taJmEj"><em>The Givenness of Things</em></a> by Marilynne Robinson</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted <a href="/17/06/marilynne-robinson-on-cultural-pessimism/">several quotes</a> <a href="/17/06/sabbath-is-a-way-of-life/">from this book</a> <a href="/17/06/the-extraordinary-moment/">already</a>, and should really queue up several more. Robinson&rsquo;s essays are so thoughtful and engaging. Finding someone who unashamedly professes a belief in orthodox Christianity while at the same time discussing that faith in terms and from angles that are far outside traditional theological writing is a huge treat. Destined to be one of my favorite books of the year.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve honestly been avoiding books on the topic of Christian views on homosexuality because I&rsquo;ve become so familiar and fatigued with the arguments over the past decade. But this one by Preston Sprinkle caught my attention and was on sale cheap at the time on Amazon, so I downloaded it to my Kindle app and gave it a go.</p>
<p>Sprinkle sets out to take an evenhanded look through the Bible at the various key texts that have been used to argue for both the Affirming and Non-Affirming positions regarding homosexual practice. I&rsquo;ll give him credit - for the majority of the book he was even enough that I had no real inkling of which side he was going to come down on. Well done!</p>
<p>The beginning of the chapter seven wherein he finally reaches a conclusion (spoiler alert: he&rsquo;s in the Non-Affirming camp) is where the shine started to come off. Not because of the conclusion he reached, but because of how he addresses 1 Corinthians 6. What do <em>malakoi</em> and <em>arsenokoites</em> really mean? How should they be translated? &ldquo;Affirming scholars&rdquo;, he tells us, &ldquo;generally argue that these words are too ambiguous.&rdquo; OK. A &ldquo;brilliant New Testament scholar at Yale University&rdquo; concludes that nobody can really know exactly what they mean. Later on about <em>arsenokoites</em>, he tells us that &ldquo;[s]cholars differ widely on what this word means&rdquo;. But after setting this scene of ambiguity, he essentially says <em>what do these words mean? Let me explain it all to you in 20 pages in a popular-level book</em>. He lost me at that point.</p>
<p>There is good stuff to take away from Sprinkle&rsquo;s book regardless of which camp you find yourself in. I appreciate his focus on loving individuals rather than flattening them to &ldquo;an issue&rdquo;. And if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the various approaches Christians have taken toward Scriptures related to homosexuality, there are worse places to start than this book to get an overview. I can&rsquo;t find myself jumping-up-and-down-excited about <em>People to Be Loved</em>, but I can affirm (sorry, couldn&rsquo;t resist) it as a solid, useful volume.</p>

			 <p>File this under &ldquo;things that would&rsquo;ve stunned the 15-year-old Chris&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a teenager, the evangelical Christian culture we were in lionized people like Jay Sekulow. He founded the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), which was out there fighting against the secular world to protect Christians' rights. He argued and won a 9-0 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed Jews for Jesus could distribute evangelistic pamphlets at Los Angeles International Airport. A sterling example for Christian young people to look up to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/statue-of-liberty.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the same time, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was spoken of with disgust. Anti-Christian. There to take away our religious liberty. Thank God we have people like Jay Sekulow to fight them on our behalf.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 25 years.</p>
<p>We now have a President who has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/05/04/their-dream-president-trump-just-gave-white-evangelicals-a-big-boost/?utm_term=.3ca22cec20a4">been described by Jerry Fallwell Jr. as &ldquo;evangelicals' dream president&rdquo;</a>. In that president&rsquo;s flurry of anti-immigrant activity, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/aclu-files-against-ice-for-iraqi-nationals/index.html">Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now looking to deport more than 100 Iraqi Christians</a>, most of whom have been in the country legally for many years, and send them back to Iraq where they are a heavily persecuted minority.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Christians immigrants being deported? Where are the religious liberty groups like the ACLJ and our brave heroes like Jay Sekulow?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right: Sekulow is currently a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jay-sekulow-new-face-trump-legal-team-russia-2017-6">part of the President&rsquo;s legal team and is making the rounds of the Sunday news talk shows arguing with TV hosts</a> about why the President&rsquo;s tweets saying &ldquo;I am under investigation&rdquo; don&rsquo;t really mean that he&rsquo;s under investigation.</p>
<p>And who is standing up for the Iraqi Christians?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-sues-stop-deportation-iraqis-targeted-weekend-ice-raids">The ACLU.</a></p>
<p>Yes, I know all the objections that will come back to this. Not all evangelicals. Franklin Graham actually broke with the President on this one. Some of the deportees have criminal records. The ACLU supports some causes I disapprove of. Etc, etc.</p>
<p>But really, this is such a stunning reversal of positions (or at least, my perception of those positions) over the past couple decades that it&rsquo;s enough to set my head spinning. It also makes me happy to have set up a recurring monthly donation to the ACLU.</p>

			 <p>Again from Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2rVMPUh"><em>The Givenness of Things</em></a>, from a chapter titled &ldquo;Proofs&rdquo;, a paragraph (which I am splitting up for online readability) about the extraordinary experience of Christian preaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great importance in Calvinist tradition of preaching makes the theology that gave rise to the practice of it a subject of interest. As a layperson who has spent a great many hours listening to sermons, I have an other than academic interest in preaching, an interest in the hope I, and so many others, bring into the extraordinary moment when someone attempts to speak in good faith, about something that matters, to people who attempt to listen in good faith. The circumstance is moving in itself, since we poor mortals are so far enmeshed in our frauds and shenanigans, not to mention our self-deceptions, that a serious attempt at meaning, spoken and heard, is quite exceptional. It has a very special character.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
My church is across the street from a university, where good souls teach with all sincerity - the factually true, insofar as this can really be known; the history of nations, insofar as this can be faithfully reported; the qualities of an art, insofar as they can be put into words. But to speak in one&rsquo;s own person and voice to others who listen from the thick of their endlessly various situations, about what truly are or ought to be matters of life and death, this is a singular thing. For this we come to church.</p>

<p>The Sabbath has a way of doing just what it was meant to do, sheltering one day in seven from the demands of economics. Its benefits cannot be commercialized. Leisure, by way of contrast, is highly commercialized. But leisure is seldom more than a bit of time ransomed from habitual stress. Sabbath is a way of life, one long since gone from this country, of course, due to secularizing trends, which are really economic pressures that have excluded rest as an option, first of all from those most in need of it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilynne_Robinson">Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s</a> for a while now, though perhaps even more for her volumes of essays than for her award-winning novels.</p>
<p><em>(As a complete aside: Robinson lives in Iowa City, and my fantasy flight back to Cedar Rapids is to end up seated next to her for the 45-minute flight from some hub airport. In my head we could have some meaningful conversation about theology; in practice it&rsquo;d take me nearly all of the flight to work up the courage to say hello. Ah well.)</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading through <a href="http://amzn.to/2rVMPUh"><em>The Givenness of Things</em></a> right now and enjoying it immensely. I&rsquo;ve found several passages that I&rsquo;d like to share, but I&rsquo;ll just start with one in this post, from a chapter titled &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo;. (I&rsquo;ve split it into a couple chunks to make it easier to read; in the original this is a single paragraph.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultural pessimism is always fashionable, and, since we are human, there are always grounds for it. It has the negative consequence of depressing the level of aspiration, the sense of the possible. And from time to time it has the extremely negative consequence of encouraging a kind of somber panic, a collective dream-state in which recourse to terrible remedies is inspired by delusions of mortal threat. If there is anything in the life of any culture or period that gives good grounds for alarm, it is the rise of cultural pessimism, whose major passion is bitter hostility toward many or most of the people within the very culture the pessimists always feel they are intent on rescuing.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When panic on one side is creating alarm on the other, it is easy to forget that there are always as good grounds for optimism as for pessimism - exactly the same grounds, in fact - that is, because we are human. We still have every potential for good we have ever had, and the same presumptive claim to respect, our own respect and one another&rsquo;s. We are still creatures of singular interest and value, agile of soul as we have always been and as we will continue to be even despite our errors and depredations, for as long as we abide on this earth. To value one another is our greatest safety, and to indulge in fear and contempt is our gravest error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I aspire to this sort of grounded, optimistic faith.</p>

			 <p>Grabbed this one off the library shelf on a whim. I read Kostova&rsquo;s <em>The Historian</em> a few years back and remember enjoying it, and I was ready for some fiction.</p>
<p>First comment on this one: bet you&rsquo;ve never read a book set in modern Bulgaria before! (Kostova is an American but is married to a Bulgarian, hence her interest in the region.) The novel flashes back and forth between present-day and early Cold War-era Bulgaria to tell the story of a family and their suffering under Communist rule.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t find it as intense or engaging as <em>The Historian</em>, but Kostova writes beautifully and the story kept me going until the last page. Not a bad choice for some casual reading.</p>

			 <p>Samuel James made a couple excellent points yesterday about our intake of the newsmedia <a href="https://blogs.mereorthodoxy.com/samuel/2017/05/18/gotta-trust-somebody/">over at Mere Orthodoxy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem for all of us is simple: You gotta trust somebody. No human being can function as their own all self-sufficient filter&hellip; To make suspicion and distrust toward established, respected, and accountable sources of information your default orientation is to either put yourself at the mercy of other sources of information–which are probably just as biased and ideological as the sources you eschew, but biased in a direction you’re more OK with–or, even worse, it’s to make intuition and assumption your primary means of knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right enough so far, yeah? Then he goes here, which may be a more squirmy point for a lot of evangelical Republicans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So what? Let’s assume you’re right that every CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, etc etc, news feature is commissioned, written, edited, and disseminated by progressives who sincerely hope I will inch further to the left after reading their coverage. So what? Do their eschatological hopes for people like me actually determine whether the information they present is valid or not? Here’s where it gets interesting. If the answer to that last question is, “Yes,” then it seems to me that conservatives have adopted a kind of philosophical identity politics. Liberals make liberal news, because they’re liberals. I don’t know for sure, but I could have sworn conservatives were suspicious of worldviews that reduced individuals to the sum total of their sociological groupings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this. While we as evangelicals have been told for decades that we can&rsquo;t trust anything from &ldquo;the liberal news media&rdquo;, we need to exercise better discernment than that.</p>
<p>This past year I&rsquo;ve ponied up for online subscriptions to both the New York Times and the Washington Post. While they&rsquo;re clearly never without an angle (and no source is), they&rsquo;ve provided very good and worthwhile reporting on current events. While not perfect, their expertise in reporting provides a good baseline of facts from which to start to understand world events. I&rsquo;m planning on maintaining my subscriptions to both.</p>
<p>Read widely, think critically, don&rsquo;t discount the concept of experts&hellip; a good word for today.</p>

<p>It is my personal and professional responsibility to bring as much enthusiasm, curiosity, and forward momentum to every single minute of my day. When I find myself in a situation where the value is not obvious, I seek it because it’s always there. “Hi, Cathy. How do you know Ray? Interesting. How’d you two end up working together in such different parts of the company? No way. I never imagined that legal and engineering would end up working together on that? Tell me that story.” With three questions, I’ve found a story that will teach a lesson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A wonderful saint I used to serve on a deacon board with (who has since gone on to glory) modeled this principle for me. Even as a senior citizen, he daily approached young people (as our local director of Youth for Christ) and drew them in with this same approach. Ask questions. &ldquo;Tell me your story.&rdquo; Listen intently. Care.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a tech manager or just a person meeting other people on a daily basis, there&rsquo;s a lot here to be learned.</p>

<p>Since I can&rsquo;t seem to get individual posts written&hellip;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pA4Jge"><em>The Silk Roads: A New History of the World</em></a> by Peter Frankopan</strong></p>
<p>A short history of the world as viewed with the Persia / India / China Silk Road corridor as the center of the action. Interesting in parts, though was far more of an overview than I was expecting. Now I need to go back and read some Persian and Chinese history.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pA91V6"><em>Born to Run</em></a> by Bruce Springsteen</strong></p>
<p>An autobiography by the famed rock-and-roller. An enjoyable read that sure seems to have his sense of style&hellip; no ghost writing here. I&rsquo;ve never followed Springsteen&rsquo;s music closely but it was fascinating to read his story.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pA8z99"><em>Dorothy Day: The World Will Be Saved by Beauty: An Intimate Portrait of My Grandmother</em></a> by Kate Hennessy</strong></p>
<p>A portrait of Catholic radical Dorothy Day as written by her granddaughter. While this book might add a lot of color for someone already very familiar with Day&rsquo;s story and importance, to somebody like me who wasn&rsquo;t familiar with her <em>at all</em>, it focused far more on their bizarre (and usually bleak) living and family arrangements. Could&rsquo;ve been more accurately subtitled <em>A Family Picture from the Perspective of Day&rsquo;s Daughter, Who Was (Rightly) Put Off by Most of It</em>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pAjksa"><em>Boeing Versus Airbus: The Inside Story of the Greatest International Competition in Business</em></a> by John Newhouse</strong></p>
<p>Interesting to me primarily because I work in the industry. The book is 10 years old - would be interesting to read an update now that Boeing&rsquo;s 787 has made it to the field.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2pnb4ek"><em>Liturgy of the Ordinary: Sacred Practices in Everyday Life</em></a> by Tish Harrison Warren</strong></p>
<p>Now this is a lovely little book. Warren, an Anglican priest from Austin, Texas, looks at how our mundane daily practices can make us mindful of God in our lives and how spiritual disciplines include mindfulness of the little things in life. An encouraging read that was over far too quickly.</p>

			 <p>Dear Becky,</p>
<p>Tomorrow the postman will drop off an Amazon package in the mailbox. Yes, it&rsquo;s another book. Yes, I know the last one I ordered just showed up a couple days ago. And the one last week before that.</p>
<p>I managed to justify them all to myself in one way or another. Last week was a book about major players in my industry, and I figured it&rsquo;d be good history for me to know. Early this week was one about leadership that a bunch of people have been raving about. Having been in a leadership position at work for almost two years, it&rsquo;s probably worth reading. Tomorrow is a two-volume (<em>sigh</em>) book of theology.</p>
<p>Had I been able to arrange the delivery date for tomorrow&rsquo;s book, I would&rsquo;ve spaced it out a little bit better, but I ordered it back in January and it just dropped this week. But hey, Amazon tells me I saved $5 by preordering, so that makes it worth it, right?</p>
<p>And yeah, I know I&rsquo;ve got a pile of books as long as my arm stacked next to the bed. And another pile as long as my other arm stacked behind that. And full bookshelves everywhere we have bookshelves. But is it really my fault that N.T. Wright is such a prodigious author? Heck, the last time I bought a book of his I spent $4.99 on sale for the Kindle version. That saves bookshelf space!</p>
<p>(On second thought, let&rsquo;s not get into how many unread books I still have on the Kindle&hellip;)</p>
<p>I have at various times in the past made a resolution that I won&rsquo;t buy any more books until I whittle down the unread pile next to the bed. It&rsquo;s probably time to make that resolution again. (Well, maybe after I use that Half Price Books gift card I was just given.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/book-pile.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point my unread book collection probably outnumbers your cast iron collection, though by weight the cast iron still wins&hellip; but maybe not for long. I think we get similar amounts of enjoyment out of our own respective collections, but to be fair I&rsquo;m sure I get far more benefit from all the yummy stuff you cook in the cast iron than you get from all the rambling I do in conversation with you after reading.</p>
<p>Thanks for nearly 20 years of putting up with my bad habits. As much as I try to improve, maybe sometimes buying another bookshelf would just be the easier solution. (If we only had room&hellip;)</p>
<p>Love, Chris</p>

			 <p>Picked this one up from the library on a whim. <em>The Madame Curie Complex</em> is a relatively short volume covering the history of a dozen or so women scientists starting with the archetypal Marie Curie and running through the 20th century up to Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey.</p>
<p>Des Jardins consistently hits the themes that these brilliant women were underappreciated, underpaid, and had uneven expectations levied on them - circumstances that continue for women across the workforce today. While each chapter provides a nice summary of each woman&rsquo;s achievements, there&rsquo;s not a compelling through line or narrative arc to the book to pull it together as a cohesive whole. Nevertheless, this is a good bit of history to read up on.</p>

			 <p>Brad Williams with <a href="https://christandpopculture.com/stop-trying-man-start-trying-good-man/">a fantastic piece on Christ and Pop Culture</a> today, saying things that desperately need to be said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Culture tells us that certain things are “manly” and certain things are “unmanly.” But we must take that with a grain of salt. Most of the time, those around us in the culture have no idea who or what they are — so taking our cues from them doesn’t make any sense. Down deep, many people are quite insecure about themselves, and so they stick to silly things like “pink is for girls” because they have no better way to define what it is to be masculine. As a good man, you must take note of these things. Such markers might be alright for immature boys, but a good man will feel some grief for adults who continue to define themselves so narrowly.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Back in 2001, John Eldredge wrote a book titled Wild at Heart. In it, he argued that every man’s desire is for “a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue.” This does sound very romantic perhaps, but that’s all it is. After all, many women have these same desires — and some men may hardly desire such things at all. A good man does not have, in his heart, a grand desire for conquest. A good man’s heart desires only peace. A good man doesn’t desire war with his neighbor in order to take what isn’t his. The prophet Micah, when teaching of the day when God’s Kingdom would finally come to Earth, wrote, “they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid” (Micah 4:4). A good man loves the peace of his own vineyard. He desires a time when there’s nothing out there to make anyone afraid. This doesn’t mean he’ll always live in peace because seeking peace can still lead to conflict, but peace should always be the end goal. Your dream of peace may lead you to a different place of contentment than a vineyard or a fig tree, but Micah’s verse reveals that a man’s proper goal is desiring the opposite of fighting battles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe the Christian manliness bro culture has dissipated a little bit since Mark Driscoll left the helm of Acts29 and Mars Hill, but it&rsquo;s still far too prevalent. Williams provides a great corrective here that those bought into the &ldquo;real manhood&rdquo; circus.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/04/06/finished-reading-faithful.html">Finished reading: Faithful Presence by David Fitch</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve kept up with David Fitch for a while now via his blog and twitter. Fitch is a professor of theology at Northern Seminary in suburban Chicago, and has led church plants that reflect his focus on community, mutual leadership and submission, and reconciliation. <a href="http://amzn.to/2nfTk5e"><em>Faithful Presence</em></a> seeks to capture those ideas in a short, practical volume for church leaders.</p>
<p>Fitch outlines three areas of presence that Christians should occupy: the &ldquo;close circle&rdquo; (presence with other Christians around the Lord&rsquo;s Supper), the &ldquo;dotted circle&rdquo; (still a fellowship of believers, but open to non-believers, typically in the context of a believer&rsquo;s home), and the &ldquo;half circle&rdquo; (extending Christian presence into the neighborhood).</p>
<p>He then spends short chapters on each of seven disciplines he outlines as critical to a faithful presence. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s Table</li>
<li>Reconciliation</li>
<li>Proclaiming the Gospel</li>
<li>Being with the &ldquo;Least of These&rdquo;</li>
<li>Being with Children</li>
<li>The Fivefold gifting (roles in church leadership)</li>
<li>Kingdom Prayer</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like Fitch&rsquo;s focus on neighborhood and community presence; this is a welcome redirection from the big evangelical church as social hub. I found resonance there with an end note from <a href="/16/02/finished-reading-accidental-saints-by-nadia-bolz-weber/">Nadia Bolz-Weber&rsquo;s <em>Accidental Saints</em></a>, where (if memory serves) she says essentially &ldquo;do you want what we have? Don&rsquo;t move here and come to my church - instead, start having a weekly dinner in your home with other believers, and let it grow from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot here to consider in an easy, small volume. Worth the read.</p>

			 <p>Skye Jethani articulates in a piece today a lot of the frustrations I have felt and heard in recent months. Just a sample:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tribe of the disillusioned is growing and the institutional containers we have inherited are struggling to hold us. The cracks are spreading. The containers are leaking. But we stay, for now, because we don’t know where to go. We don’t know who to follow. We don’t know where we belong. The disillusioned wonder—where are the voices that affirm traditional Christian marriage without condemning our neighbors who do not? The disillusioned wonder—where are the churches that focus more on loving people in the name of God than using people in the name of mission? The disillusioned wonder—where are the humble Christians that can discern the difference between a loss of privilege and real persecution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I appreciate that he doesn&rsquo;t just leave us in the wondering but gives us some encouragement for where to go from here. Worth reading.</p>

			 <p>If I posted these individually when I finished the books, I&rsquo;d have more frequent posts on the blog here&hellip; oh well.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2otcGnU"><em>Before the Fall</em></a> by Noah Hawley</strong> An interesting little thriller / mystery about a man who survives a private plane crash. Not as thrilling or involved as it could be, but good basic entertainment. I hear that this guy is writing for the TV show Legion, which leads me to think I should maybe give it a try.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2n42jXr"><em>The Girl Who Drank the Moon</em></a> by Kelly Barnhill</strong> I saw this one was a fantasy story that had won the Newbery, so I figured I&rsquo;d give it a shot in hopes of finding something I could give my daughters to read. It&rsquo;s a nice story, a little bit dark in places but with hopeful messages. It&rsquo;s not as funny as a Terry Pratchett or Neil Gaiman story, and there&rsquo;s a lot going on in it. I think my older two daughters would probably handle it OK, but at the moment I can&rsquo;t manage to get either of them interested in it. Oh well.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2otfpgQ"><em>A Natural History of the Piano: The Instrument, the Music, the Musicians&ndash;from Mozart to Modern Jazz and Everything in Between</em></a> by Stuart Isacoff</strong> Picked this one up on a whim and enjoyed it. Basically it&rsquo;s a short history not just of the development of the piano as an instrument but also of the composers and musicians who used it. My favorite part of reading books about music like this is that I&rsquo;m always pointed to some new music. This time the bit of interest is Shostakovich&rsquo;s 24 Preludes and Fugues, a cycle modeled after Bach&rsquo;s. Now if only the sheet music wasn&rsquo;t nearly $100&hellip;</p>

I love this little bit of what he had to say about the church being &ldquo;from the future&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I say I&rsquo;m from the future, what I mean is that in baptism I have come to live under the reign and rule of Christ here and now. And I use an illustration: this is what the Church should be like. If you go to a movie, and you&rsquo;re there to see, well, whatever you&rsquo;re there to see, everybody knows that before the actual movie starts you have the previews. And what a preview is, is 2, 3, 4 minutes of a coming attraction. This movie is not here yet, but they&rsquo;re going to show you enough of it that you get an idea of what it will be like. The church is to be a preview of the age to come. We&rsquo;re not perfect, we don&rsquo;t claim that. But we should be able - I don&rsquo;t think we really can, for the most part - but we should be able to say to the wider culture, &ldquo;look at our communities. This is where this thing is headed. This is what the reign of Christ actually looks like, because we are from the future, we are embodying that here and now.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When the good Bishop N. T. Wright has a new book out it&rsquo;s an automatic purchase for me at this point. And Wright does not disappoint with <a href="http://amzn.to/2nNjrzx"><em>The Day the Revolution Began: Reconsidering the Meaning of Jesus&rsquo;s Crucifixion</em></a>. Wright examines the meaning of Jesus' death in his usual lucid style, with a focus on what understanding the first-century Christians would&rsquo;ve had of that death.</p>
<p>Wright keys on Paul&rsquo;s statement in 1 Corinthians 15 that &ldquo;Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures&rdquo;. This launches him on a review of the Old Testament idea of salvation and forgiveness of sins, and how for Israel &ldquo;forgiveness of sins&rdquo; was closely tied to the covenant promise of restoration from exile.</p>
<p>Wright then takes the reader through the various New Testament discussions of the meaning of the crucifixion to make the case that &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really primarily about individual salvation (though individuals <em>are</em> saved), but is rather about the restoration and blessing of the whole earth through Israel in fulfillment of God&rsquo;s covenant promise to Abraham.</p>
<p>Wright, as usual, says some things that undoubtedly set some conservative theologians on edge. Notable among these is his contention that Jesus' death isn&rsquo;t really about some sort of penal substitution. That, says Wright, is still buying into a system of works righteousness - even if the works aren&rsquo;t our works - that isn&rsquo;t borne out in the Bible&rsquo;s view of God&rsquo;s love as shown in His covenant promises.</p>
<p>Wright makes the case that salvation is really about much more than we are led to believe. And while he acknowledges that theologians will typically provide a more nuanced view, he believes (and I agree) that at the lay level in evangelicalism, the understanding of salvation is very individual and transactional - people sin, which makes God angry, a price must be paid, Jesus pays that price to step in the way of God&rsquo;s anger, people are saved to go to heaven. I don&rsquo;t think that Wright would disagree with any of those statements&hellip; from a certain point of view. However, his picture of salvation is much wider and more appealing. It&rsquo;s really worth a read and consideration.</p>
<p>This volume would be a nice companion piece to go alongside <a href="http://amzn.to/2nkx3iT"><em>Surprised by Hope</em></a> - which itself is still the volume I&rsquo;d encourage people to read if they need an intro to Wright. Good stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2n0u2qw"><em>Last Year</em></a> by Robert Charles Wilson A time-travel novel in which the present day has a gate into one possible past, but only to a specific time the 1870s. More thoughtful than I anticipated.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2n0FKl7"><em>Dune</em></a> by Frank Herbert Caught up with a classic I&rsquo;d never read. Really enjoyed it. Now I suppose I&rsquo;ll get sucked into the whole series.</p>

			 <p>I was catching up on my backlog of <a href="http://onbeing.org/">On Being podcasts</a> and came across a fascinating discussion with writer <a href="http://alaindebotton.com/">Alain de Botton</a>. de Botton is an atheist, but provided a description of the idea of love of fellow citizen (in my words, &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo;) that was insightful to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MR. DE BOTTON: &hellip;I think you’re onto something huge and rather counterintuitive because we associate the word “love” with private life. We don’t associate it with life in the republic, with civil society. But I think that a functioning society requires two things that, again, just don’t sound very normal, but they require <strong>love</strong> and <strong>politeness</strong>. And by “love” I mean <strong>a capacity to enter imaginatively into the minds of people with whom you don’t immediately agree, and to look for the more charitable explanations for behavior which doesn’t appeal to you and which could seem plain wrong</strong>, not just to chuck them immediately in prison or to hold them up in front of a law court but to…
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
MS. TIPPETT: Or just tell them how stupid they are, right?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
MR. DE BOTTON: Right. Exactly. We’re permanently — all sides are attempting to show how stupid every other side is. And the other thing, of course, is politeness, which is an attempt not necessarily to say everything, to understand that there is a role for private feelings, which if they were to emerge, would do damage to everyone concerned. But we’ve got this culture of kind of self-disclosure. And as I say, it spills out into politics as well. The same dynamic goes on of, like, “If I’m not telling you exactly what I think, then I may develop a twitch or an illness from not expunging my feelings.” To which I would say, “No, you’re not. You’re preserving the peace and the good nature of the republic, and it’s absolutely what you should be doing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really like this definition of love of neighbor that way - to work to understand them by giving them the benefit of the doubt, to look for the most charitable explanation for their position. We as Christians could take that idea to heart.</p>

			 <p>Another random library selection, and a nice change of pace from history and theology. In <em>Now</em>, Cal Berkeley professor Richard Muller sets out to provide a layman&rsquo;s-level discussion of the nature of time and how the domain of physics interacts with and helps explain it.</p>
<p>Muller provides an engaging discussion about relativistic time dilation, the big bang, quantum effects and &ldquo;spooky action at a distance&rdquo;, and his own thoughts about what it is that causes time to move only forward. It&rsquo;s not entirely for the faint of heart, but he at least is good enough to leave his derivation of equations into appendices rather than embedding them within the body text. The Goodreads reviews of the book seem to be a bunch of physics nerds giving the author flack for his approach, but to this engineering nerd who isn&rsquo;t deep into physics, it was just fine.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll confess I&rsquo;d never heard of <a href="http://www.jamesrhodes.tv/">James Rhodes</a> prior to picking this book up at the library. Turns out he&rsquo;s about my age, and a British classical pianist who has had some amount of popular culture impact in Britain trying to make classical music less culturally stuffy and more accessible to the masses.</p>
<p><em>Instrumental</em> isn&rsquo;t nearly so much about music as it is about a man trying to come to grips with the effects of some horrifying abuse he underwent as a young boy in primary school. I&rsquo;ve never read an account that so directly describes the horror and brokenness that an abuse victim can feel. One of Rhodes' escapes is music, but he vividly describes others that are much less beautiful and much more self-destructive.</p>
<p>Rhodes does mention a couple handfuls of favorite classical pieces through the book, which someone has already arranged into <a href="https://play.spotify.com/user/canongate/playlist/5mmEdd2fEpEiejq4lg2jZE?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">a convenient Spotify playlist</a>.</p>

			 <p>The buzz on this one had been going around Twitter for a while, so I was glad to pick up a copy and read. <a href="http://michaelwear.com/">Michael Wear</a> is a young guy who, not even out of college, worked as the White House lead for evangelical outreach during President Obama&rsquo;s first term. <em>Reclaiming Hope</em> is part memoir of those years and partly Wear&rsquo;s suggestions for how to repair political engagement with religion.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think Wear did a good job of identifying points where both the right and left failed in opportunities to find common ground that could&rsquo;ve made legitimate progress on issues important to religious conservatives. However, I think his admiration for President Obama causes him to pull his punches in the second half of the book.</p>
<p>In the first half of the book, Wear reveals himself as something of an Obama fan boy as he details all of the President&rsquo;s speeches that reveal the depth to his personal faith. (I&rsquo;m not disputing these - I have great admiration for Obama&rsquo;s faith - but the tone is pretty fawning.) When Wear starts assigning blame in the second half of the book, though, the blame is never to Obama directly, but always to the &ldquo;administration&rdquo; or the &ldquo;White House&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a good little memoir, and Wear has some good thoughts to share about how we might find progress forward on issues significant to people of faith.</p>

			 <p>History, it is often said, is written by the winners. Zinn, though, undertakes to tell a history of America from the perspective of the losers, the poor, the oppressed. Think the arrival of the explorers from the perspective of the Native Americans. The colonial and early US history from the perspective of the slaves. The early 1900s from the perspective of poor workers banding together into labor unions.</p>
<p>Zinn is not trying to be even-handed here, but this volume would serve as an excellent companion to any more traditional history of the United States. It also serves as a good reminder that while things may seem bleak in our current political era, they have been much worse, and our country has withstood far more.</p>

			 <p>As I sit and write today we are in day two of Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency. Across the United States and around the world, hundreds of thousands of people are marching in protest of Trump&rsquo;s disregard for women and minorities. It&rsquo;s likely that the number of attendees at the marches in Washington, DC, will far outnumber the crowds at Trump&rsquo;s inauguration yesterday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a broad number of first-hand reports from those marches all morning via Twitter. What astonished me, though, was seeing the broad difference in coverage between various online news sources. Here&rsquo;s what I found. I screen captured these websites around 11:30 AM central time.</p>
<p><strong>ABC News</strong></p>
<p>ABC&rsquo;s top story is the march, with a photo. It&rsquo;s followed by headlines about President Trump&rsquo;s visit to the National Cathedral, a tornado in Missisippi, and an avalanche in Italy. A fair spread of news for the first screen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>BBC News</strong></p>
<p>Again the lead is the marches, with special note taken that there are protests around the world, not just in DC. They quickly link to analysis pieces. &ldquo;Why are the women marching?&rdquo; &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s angry call to arms.&rdquo; And who can resist the delicious headline &ldquo;Democrats flail in abyss&rdquo;?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>NPR News</strong></p>
<p>NPR leads with the themes of President Trump&rsquo;s inaugural message: &ldquo;American carnage&rdquo; and &ldquo;America First&rdquo;. Second comes the marches.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>CNN</strong></p>
<p>CNN is all about the marches on the first screen, including live video coverage and individual stories apparently profiling marchers. Just below the digital fold is a section titled &ldquo;The Start of the Trump Era&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Fox News</strong></p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Fox News. Screen one: Trump signs an executive order to try to gut the Affordable Care Act. Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;new vision&rdquo; for America. I was curious, so I kept scrolling.</p>
<p>Screen two: Obama&rsquo;s flight to a vacation diverted due to bad weather. Full text of Trump&rsquo;s inauguration speech. Other news sites deem Trump&rsquo;s speech offensive. Trump has to part with &ldquo;beloved cellphone&rdquo;. Trump attends prayer service. &ldquo;Three Things Every Christian Owes Donald Trump&rdquo;. (Well, OK, then.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep going.</p>
<p>Screen three: &ldquo;Food Network Star implies Trump plagiarized Inauguration Cake&rdquo;. (Take a look at the side-by-side pictures. Totally plagiarized. But I digress.) And <em>there it is</em>! Finally! One line! &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of women march on Washington&rdquo;. No photo. But a big photo of tornado damage in Mississippi and one of a bust of Winston Churchill that Trump has returned to the Oval Office.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now friends, the disparity in coverage is, I hope, so obvious that I don&rsquo;t even really need to point it out. What this highlights, though is that how and where we get our news matters.</p>
<p>Every reporter and news organization has some sort of bias. We will never find a source that is completely neutral. There have been Washington marches in the past (e.g. the Right-to-Life march every year) that CNN will ignore and Fox News will headline.</p>
<p>What we can learn to do, though, is to read widely and to become aware of those biases. If your only source for news is Fox, I beg you, watch some CNN as well. Or read the New York Times. If your only source is MSNBC or NPR, read some Fox for balance.</p>
<p>Facts are facts, but perspectives are tricky things. For us to navigate the upcoming years as people of good will we must work diligently to learn the facts, and to recognize perspective and bias in ourselves and those around us.</p>

Soggin&rsquo;s work looks at the Old Testament from a historical perspective and dives heavily into textual criticism.</p>
<p>It is eye-opening for this conservative evangelical to see how far the academically-accepted historical background of the OT differs from the one we are taught by our church leaders, but rather than causing me to look askance at the OT now, it causes me to appreciate more how God has brought together these texts in a way that is meaningful for us as believers today. (It also cements in my mind that defining &ldquo;infallibility&rdquo; for the Scriptures is an impossible task, and that &ldquo;inspired&rdquo; or &ldquo;God-breathed&rdquo; makes much more sense.)</p>
<p>Glad I read this one&hellip; and ready for something a little less academic now as a palate cleanser.</p>

			 <p>Read this one on a business trip this week. Having nothing to do with actual nautical survival skills, this book is Martin&rsquo;s personal confessional and memoir of the breakup of his marriage and leaving the pastorate at his church.</p>
<p>Martin is a very talented writer, and while some of the initial Scripture applications are a stretch (Paul, after his shipwreck, told the people to eat, therefore, when our lives are in metaphorical shipwrecks, we should be sure we eat via participation in the Eucharist), the book shines in the latter chapters when he focuses in on grace in a way that will sound familiar to readers of Robert F. Capon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that&rsquo;s skeptical of the value of an author writing this instructionally when he was clearly still in the midst of learning the lessons he&rsquo;s communicating, but it was still an encouraging read. My prayer for Jonathan is that he continues to heal and grow in grace in the days to come.</p>

			 <p>A little more than 8 years ago I did something I&rsquo;d never done before, and voted for a Democrat for president. For a born-and-raised Republican, this was a big step. But there was something about this man that was special. He talked in an inspiring way about hope that we hadn&rsquo;t heard from politicians in quite a while. And there was something special about electing America&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>I remember sitting at home watching President-Elect Obama give an acceptance speech before a massive crowd at Grant Park in Chicago. It seemed like a turning point of sorts, a reason to be hopeful about our political situation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJfGx4G8tjo">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Now by any measure there are gripes each of us would have with the policies and decisions President Obama has made over the past 8 years. Politics is the art of the compromise. If everyone comes away from the table feeling like they got some of, but not all of, what they wanted, the process probably worked. Now, depending on your political convictions, you may have agreed with most of what he did, or only a little of what he did, but such is the nature of politics.</p>
<p>Tonight President Obama, a week before leaving office, again gave a Chicago speech, but this time a farewell speech. And what a speech it was.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siyBp8Csugk">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>President Obama called us as Americans to pursue the higher, nobler, goals of sacrifice for, and service to others. And he spoke clearly about our need to see the world from the perspective of our neighbors. Forgive a long quoted section, but it&rsquo;s so good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction, Atticus Finch, who said “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For blacks and other minority groups, that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face. Not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender American, but also the middle-aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he’s got all the advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic, and cultural, and technological change. We have to pay attention and listen.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For white Americans, it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and Jim Crow didn’t suddenly vanish in the ’60s; that when minority groups voice discontent, they’re not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness; when they wage peaceful protest, they’re not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment that our founders promised.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
For native-born Americans, it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, and Italians, and Poles, who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of America. And as it turned out, America wasn’t weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this nation’s creed, and this nation was strengthened.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
So regardless of the station we occupy; we all have to try harder; we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family just like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own. And that’s not easy to do. For too many of us it’s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods, or on college campuses, or places of worship, or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
In the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste, all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it’s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there. And this trend represents a third threat to our democracy.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
Look, politics is a battle of ideas. That’s how our democracy was designed. In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we’re going to keep talking past each other. And we’ll make common ground and compromise impossible. And isn’t that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting? How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on pre-school for kids, but not when we’re cutting taxes for corporations? How do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party, but pounce when the other party does the same thing? It’s not just dishonest, it’s selective sorting of the facts. It’s self-defeating because, as my mom used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Obama has also traversed eight years of service as a dedicated and loving father and husband. His words at the end of the speech tonight were enough to have any father in tears:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michelle&hellip; Michelle LaVaughn Robinson of the South Side&hellip; &hellip; for the past 25 years you have not only been my wife and mother of my children, you have been my best friend. You took on a role you didn’t ask for. And you made it your own with grace and with grit and with style, and good humor. You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody. And a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model. You have made me proud, and you have made the country proud. Malia and Sasha&hellip; &hellip; under the strangest of circumstances you have become two amazing young women. You are smart and you are beautiful. But more importantly, you are kind and you are thoughtful and you are full of passion. And you wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I have done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanks-obama">&ldquo;Thanks, Obama&rdquo;</a> meme has been around for almost the entire duration of Obama&rsquo;s presidency. Originally used to sarcastically &ldquo;thank&rdquo; the president for anything deemed to be his fault, it quickly grew to blame him for things he had no hand in. In the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve seen folks of a more liberal stripe using it more ironically, which seems like it&rsquo;s come full circle in a way.</p>
<p>But tonight I&rsquo;d like to say it quite genuinely. Thanks, Obama. Thanks, Mr. President. Our country is better off because of your service, and we are all better for your example of service and faithfulness.</p>

			 <p>I got sucked into Griffin&rsquo;s Badge of Honor series years ago. This is book #13, and the hero is still only 27 years old, and opens the story still suffering from the wound he suffered in book #12. Hey, if Griffin is still making money cranking these out at age 87, good for him. But let&rsquo;s not pretend they&rsquo;re any more substantive entertainment than your average 1.5-star franchise action movie. Meh.</p>

			 <p>Found this on the library shelf and was a challenging read to start the year. Is Kendi making an effort to be super-even-handed? Nope. But he has enough facts on his side to make a compelling account. From the first white settlers colonizing through the beginning of the 21st century, he highlights the terrifying history of racism in the USA. It can feel like a stretch at times - King Kong subliminally picturing white&rsquo;s fear of blacks? sure, but the Rocky movies continuing to do so with the white hero taking on black opponents? Maybe from a certain point of view.</p>
<p>Some progressive reading isn&rsquo;t gonna hurt me, I guess. (I just borrowed Zinn&rsquo;s <em>History</em> from the library the other day.)</p>

			 <p>Another year, another book list. I think this year I can at least say that the unread book pile gathering dust by my bed is a little smaller than it has been in previous year.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101?order=a&amp;shelf=2016-reads&amp;sort=date_read">reading list for 2016 is on Goodreads</a>. To summarize my year in reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>I read 76 books in total. (This is the most for any year since I started logging in 2007.)</li>
<li>40 were non-fiction - primarily biography, history, and theology</li>
<li>36 were fiction - pretty heavily sci-fi and fantasy this year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My favorite non-fiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2j25Wub"><em>The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America&rsquo;s Great Migration</em></a> by Isabel Wilkerson. This is a wonderfully-told story of the migration of blacks from plantations in the south to cities in the north during the early-to-mid 1900&rsquo;s. Sure, I&rsquo;ve heard stories of the mistreatment blacks went through, but to have it brought so recent (some of the people in this book were still living circa 2004!) was sobering.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iYvPr2"><em>Hamilton: The Revolution</em></a> by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It&rsquo;s Hamilton. What else do I need to say?</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iYmZJE"><em>Reading Revelation Responsibly: Uncivil Worship and Witness: Following the Lamb into the New Creation</em></a> by Michael J. Gorman. I read this as we were wrapping up a sermon series on Revelation at church. I find Gorman&rsquo;s take on that apocalyptic text to be highly compelling. <a href="/16/05/reading-revelation-responsibly-by-michael-j-gorman/">I blogged about it earlier this year</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My favorite fiction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2iYqTm1"><em>The Wee Free Men</em></a> by Terry Pratchett. I found this on a pre-teen recommended reading list and read it along with my oldest daughter. We enjoyed it so much we decided to make it a read-aloud book for the whole family. Crivens!</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2j23KTw"><em>All the Light We Cannot See</em></a> by Anthony Doerr. Lots of people have written better about this than I can. A beautiful story, beautifully told.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2hLovTo"><em>Jayber Crow</em></a> by Wendell Berry. Berry has a unique voice and his stories of Port William, Kentucky, are treasures.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2hLoCyi"><em>Underground Airlines</em></a> by Ben H. Winters. Imagine, if you will, that slavery was still legal in the US South, and that Underground Railroad-type activities were still happening. Interested in what happens next? Go get this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll get to 76 books again this year - I know I already have a few really thick ones on the to-read list that might slow me down - but as always it&rsquo;s fun to read, fun to review at end-of-year, and fun to have books to recommend and give to others.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/01/02/talking-complementarianism-and.html">Talking Complementarianism and Egalitarianism with Brent Thomas</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2017/01/02/talking-complementarianism-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-01-02 20:07:16 -0500">Jan 2, 2017</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Brent Thomas is kicking the dust off his blog in the hopes of fostering some charitable discussions on contentious topics. He starts out with a doozy: <a href="http://www.holidayatthesea.com/can-we-talk-complementarianegalitarian-edition/">complementarianism vs. egalitarianism</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s start with “complimentarianism” and “egalitarianism”. For those not familiar with these terms, they have to do with the idea of gender roles, particularly in ministry (at least that’s what we’ll focus on for the sake of this conversation though the issue certainly applies to marriage and gender-relations as a whole so feel free to take the conversation there if you’d like). Most Christians would argue that men and women are created equal, that’s not the issue here. Instead, the question becomes gender role, particularly within a ministry context. Complementarians argue that, because of unique gender roles found in Scripture, women are prohibited from leadership roles within the local church such as “elder” or “pastor” while Egalitarians argue that not only do no such Scriptural barriers exist, women are just as called and qualified to serve in such roles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He admits this is a simplification of the issue, but then kicks off the discussion with a series of questions that I&rsquo;ll give my answers to here. If you&rsquo;re interested in the discussion, I&rsquo;d encourage you to answer them yourself either on your own web space or in Brent&rsquo;s comments. The following questions are his, the answers mine.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-view-this-as-an-issue-of-orthodoxy-in-other-words-if-someone-holds-a-different-position-than-you-on-gender-roles-do-you-believe-them-to-still-be-a-christian">Do you view this as an issue of “orthodoxy”? In other words, if someone holds a different position than you on gender-roles, do you believe them to still be a Christian?</h4>
<p>I do not believe this is an issue of orthodoxy.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-do-not-view-this-as-an-issue-of-orthodoxy-how-important-is-this-issue-to-you-where-would-you-rank-it-on-a-scale-of-theologicalcultural-importance-top-bottom-middle-etc">If you do not view this as an issue of orthodoxy, how important is this issue to you? Where would you rank it on a scale of theological/cultural importance (top, bottom, middle, etc.)?</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;d rate it as a matter of middling importance to me. It&rsquo;s not significant enough to, by itself, drive a change in the church that I attend. I don&rsquo;t have a big enough progressive soapbox to rate it as too highly culturally important. I lean that way sometimes, but I don&rsquo;t have a soapbox - just a few soap flakes or something.</p>
<h4 id="do-you-hold-to-either-position-why-what-scriptures-or-outside-booksauthors-helped-you-arrive-at-your-position-how-do-you-succinctly-explain-your-position-to-others-especially-those-who-might-disagree-what-pushed-you-in-one-direction-or-the-other">Do you hold to either position? Why? What Scriptures or outside books/authors helped you arrive at your position? How do you succinctly explain your position to others, especially those who might disagree? What pushed you in one direction or the other?</h4>
<p>I personally hold rather gently to the egalitarian position. (I am a member of a church that is firmly complementarian.) I grew up being taught a complementarian position and held to it up until the past 7 - 8 years. I recall reviewing Scot McKnight&rsquo;s <em>The Blue Parakeet</em> (in which he advocates for the egalitarian position) shortly before it was released and <a href="/08/09/scot-mcknights-the-blue-parakeet-a-review/">blogging my disagreement with Dr. McKnight&rsquo;s conclusions</a>. He then chided me in the comments for not answering the actual questions he was asking. In retrospect, he had a point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve considered the Scriptures, read plenty of the online debate on the topic, and have been significantly influenced by female friends who serve in leadership positions at their egalitarian churches. My thoughts have undoubtedly also been influenced, though in ways I can&rsquo;t as easily put my finger on, by having three daughters of my own.</p>
<p>The other experience that sticks out to me was taking communion last year at an egalitarian church where the elements were served by a husband-and-wife couple. I&rsquo;m not sure whether serving the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is gender-restricted in typical complementarian churches. (The elements are served by the elders in my current church, but not sure if that&rsquo;s doctrine or just tradition.) But having the elements served and words spoken by both the man and woman serving was a very powerful experience.</p>
<h4 id="why-do-you-believe-that-this-issue-seems-to-cause-such-division-why-has-it-been-so-controversial-to-so-many-how-can-people-on-all-sides-of-this-issue-come-together-without-sacrificing-their-own-convictions-or-can-they">Why do you believe that this issue seems to cause such division? Why has it been so controversial to so many? How can people on all sides of this issue come together without sacrificing their own convictions? Or can they?</h4>
<p>I think this issue causes division because it gets easily lumped in together with other gender-related issues like homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The hermeneutics that are typically used to support the egalitarian position - specifically, that Paul&rsquo;s teaching was for a specific situation and time and not necessarily applicable for all Christians at all times - are similar to those used to support acceptance of homosexuality within the church. Thus the slippery-slope argument kicks in pretty quick.</p>
<p>I believe people can come together on this issue if they are willing to view it as a secondary matter. Clearly the stretching is mostly done by the complementarians, though I really appreciate Richard Beck&rsquo;s testimony of being an egalitarian in a complementarian church and <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2012/08/a-letter-for-highland-on-womens-roles.html">gracefully maintaining that he will not serve in any role that a women would not also be allowed to serve in</a>. That could be as easy as joining together with other churches from time to time and being respectful when they have women serving in leadership, or finding ways to have women serve and teach in more visible ways.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks, Brent, for inviting the discussion. I look forward to reading others' opinions as well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve got a soft spot in my heart (and on my reading list) for science fiction. It probably started when I was reading Michael Crichton as a 12-year-old. OK, Crichton might not be the first one you think of when I said &ldquo;science fiction&rdquo;, but Crichton&rsquo;s mix of legit science into thriller novels was an appealing first taste. (<em>Jurassic Park</em>? eh, fine. <em>The Andromeda Strain</em>? Better.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an awful lot that gets passed through in the name of &ldquo;science fiction&rdquo; these days, though. For some incomprehensible reason, our libraries lump sci-fi and fantasy together, which means you&rsquo;ve gotta be careful or instead of picking up a hard-science space opera you&rsquo;ll end up with some multi-volume epic starring sexy telepathic cat people on a far-away planet that resembles nothing so much as medieval England. But I digress.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I started with Crichton, but progressed quickly to Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Later on I enjoyed Stephen Baxter&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_Trilogy"><em>Manifold</em> trilogy</a> and some of Robert Sawyer&rsquo;s stuff. I still browse the New Sci-fi shelf at the library on a regular basis, but most of the time when I pick up an interesting-looking volume, it turns out to be Volume 17 of some big space opera, and ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, though, The Incomparable podcast devoted an episode to Hugo Award nominees, and somebody brought up Cixin Liu&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePnlmz"><em>The Three Body Problem</em></a>. I was unacquainted with Liu, but found that this prolific Chinese author was finally getting a book translated into English. And what a book.</p>
<p>The <em>Three Body</em> trilogy continues with <a href="http://amzn.to/2g2xpuh"><em>The Dark Forest</em></a> and wraps up with <a href="http://amzn.to/2ePlGxr"><em>Death&rsquo;s End</em></a>, the translation of which just released this fall. I finished reading <em>Death&rsquo;s End</em> last night and wow, what a epic, sweeping trilogy. It begins as a current-day encounter with an alien race of such advanced technology they can hardly be understood, and traverses time and space to some distant future where the universe collapses in on itself only to explode again in another Big Bang.</p>
<p>Liu digs in to communication via gravitational waves, the survival strategies of intergalactic civilizations, and lightspeed travel, while telling a story expansive in spacetime in a way that hearkens back to Clarke and Asimov. The English translations are excellent, and while the books aren&rsquo;t short, they kept me engaged through the final page.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve stuck with this post this far, <em>The Three Body Problem</em> might be one you want to pick up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed baseball for as long as I can remember. I have fond memories of attending my first baseball game (the Omaha Royals) when I was probably 7, and of watching Game 7 of the 1985 World Series (Royals win in 7!) when I was 8. I followed the Rangers when I lived in Texas in high school and college, and enjoyed getting to see Nolan Ryan pitch and attending the 1995 MLB All-Star Game.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Iowa, and with a bunch of new friends who were Cubs fans, I became a Cubs fan. Little did I know what I was getting myself into.</p>
<p>I remember sitting in a friend&rsquo;s basement watching the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bartman_incident">Bartman game</a> in 2003. They were so close to the World Series, and then collapsed. Again.</p>
<p>Then came 2016. The Cubs started off hot and stayed that way. I followed them more closely than I had in previous years, and my kids were now old enough to enjoy the games themselves. That the Cubs would make the playoffs seemed a foregone conclusion; the question was could they finally go all the way?</p>
<p>I told the girls that if the Cubs won the World Series, everybody would be getting new Cubs swag. As the playoffs progressed, I wondered a bit whether they were cheering the Cubs more to see them win, or to get new t-shirts. But cheer they did.</p>
<p>I pretty much lost faith around game 4 of the World Series. The Cubs were down 3 games to 1, and looked terrible doing it. I refused to watch Game 5. I didn&rsquo;t want the stress. My wife turned on Game 6 after the Cubs took a lead. And then came Game 7.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t not watch Game 7. And you can&rsquo;t really send the kids to bed for it, either, even if it <em>is</em> a school night. We were feeling pretty good about it when the Cubs had a lead early. Addison was painting Cubs artwork in the basement during the middle innings. Then the Indians tied it up and my heart was in my stomach. <em>Here comes the collapse,</em> I thought.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our youngest daughter finally gave up trying to stay awake about 10:30 and went to bed. When the game went to extra innings and a rain delay at 11:00, we sent the older two to bed. But 15 minutes later when the game resumed and the Cubs got a couple hits, they heard me yelp at the TV and came rushing back in to watch the game.</p>
<p>So at 11:30 on a school night, the four of us sat in bed and counted down the last three outs for the Cubs to win the Series. I hope it&rsquo;s a memory that sticks with them as long as my memory of Bret Saberhagen coming off the mount to talk to George Brett prior to getting the final out in 1985.</p>
<p>Then this weekend we went shopping.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe next year&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;they&rsquo;ll win it again.</p>

<li>After traveling two out of the last three weeks for work, it&rsquo;s good to be home.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been really fun having football season start up this past few weeks, but now that the MLB playoffs are starting I&rsquo;m likely gonna ignore football as long as the Cubs are still in it.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>huge</strong> amount of Cubs gear for sale in all the stores around here.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been saying that my goal is to not buy another piece of Cubs gear until I can buy one that says &ldquo;World Series Champions&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s hoping that means I&rsquo;ll get to buy some before too many more weeks/years go by.</li>
<li><em>Please don&rsquo;t jinx it please don&rsquo;t jinx it please don&rsquo;t jinx it #GoCubsGo</em></li>
<li>On reflection, it&rsquo;s been an odd year for me music-wise: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve bought an album or really sunk my teeth into anything new all year. The last record I bought and really fell in love with was the <em>Hamilton</em> Original Broadway Cast recording last fall.</li>
<li>Hamilton. Chicago. March. Can&rsquo;t wait.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that part of my reason for buying less music is that I&rsquo;ve had a Spotify subscription this year. I don&rsquo;t listen to it a ton, but it&rsquo;s great for taking a listen to some new album w/o having to go purchase it or just listen to 30-second samples first.</li>
<li>Can we just get done with the election already? The presidential candidates have been in Iowa since at least August 2015. This is far too long.</li>

			 <p>As a musician and long-term volunteer worship leader, I have plenty of opinions when it comes to church music. So this morning when I came across a job posting for a Music Director position I was brought up short. And boy, do I have opinions.</p>
<p><a href="http://jobs.thegospelcoalition.org/music-director/2323">Here&rsquo;s the job posting.</a> On The Gospel Coalition website, it&rsquo;s for <a href="http://paramountchurch.com/">Paramount Church</a> of Jacksonville, Florida. It&rsquo;s hard to tell from their church website how large their church is, but there appears to be one paid staff pastor and about a dozen deacons.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the job posting, which comes in 3 sections. I&rsquo;m bolding the things that stick out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="a-general-description-of-position">A. General Description of Position</h4>
<p>Paramount Church is a gospel-centered church in Jacksonville FL. The Director of Music is responsible for <strong>designing and implementing</strong> a style of music that is <strong>contemporary and band-driven yet not contemporary for the sake of novel, innovative creativity</strong>. The ideal candidate for this position will be committed to the centrality of the gospel in all things and possess a solid knowledge of and commitment to the historic Christian worship of the church. The Director will coordinate music plans with the Preaching/Teaching elder, and recruit, direct, and train a team of volunteer musicians. <strong>Significant musical experience in performing and directing a contemporary band along with experience in songwriting and production is ideal.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what &ldquo;not contemporary for the sake of novel, innovative creativity&rdquo; means. How exactly do you have un-novel, non-innovative creativity? It is OK to be contemporary as long as we&rsquo;re copying others and not doing our own thing? But that&rsquo;s just a small quibble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Significant musical experience in performing and directing a contemporary band along with experience in songwriting and production.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a lot. Wow.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="b-position-duties-and-responsibilities">B. Position Duties and Responsibilities</h4>
<ol>
<li>Plan and implement Trinitarian, gospel-centered music (Col. 3:16) for Sunday worship services, and special services as required, in consultation with the Elders</li>
<li>Recruit, train, and rehearse members of the music team.</li>
<li>Disciple music team members in a gospel-centered, historic worship paradigm</li>
<li>Coordinate with A/V team regularly to assure quality sound and video/visuals for each presentation and oversee training of A/V volunteers</li>
<li>Attend weekly meetings with the Elders and Leadership Team.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s fairly straightforward. Aside from the &ldquo;gospel-centered&rdquo; buzzwords that add more branding than meaning any more, that sounds like a standard music director position.</p>
<p>But here comes the big list. Hold on tight!</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="c-position-qualifications">C. Position Qualifications</h4>
<ol>
<li>Committed to definitive Nicene orthodoxy and gospel-centeredness in doctrine, life, and music</li>
<li>Possess a solid understanding of and commitment to historic Christian worship</li>
<li>Band-driven rather than orchestral-driven style of music</li>
<li>Must be able to <strong>incorporate strings, percussion, and other instruments into contemporary-band driven arrangements</strong></li>
<li>Must be able to play piano and/or guitar in a contemporary band setting</li>
<li>Minimum of <strong>bachelor&rsquo;s degree in music</strong> and/or 5 years' related church or industry experience. <strong>Possessing an MDiv or MA in theology is ideal.</strong></li>
<li>High-level of overall musicianship</li>
<li>A builder/self-motivated/entrepreneurial spirit</li>
<li><strong>Sanguine stage presence</strong></li>
<li>Experience in leading corporate worship, and <strong>knowledge of directing, orchestrating, and coordinating various instruments in a band</strong></li>
<li>Ability to work with and train vocalists in singing of parts</li>
<li>Ability to <strong>incorporate backing tracks and loops into regular Sunday and special services</strong></li>
<li>Leadership ability and <strong>ability to work with and inspire volunteers</strong></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Holy cow. Really? Must be able to incorporate strings, percussion, other instruments into a contemporary band. Oh, and also incorporate backing tracks and loops. And also be able to direct and orchestrate the instruments in the band.</p>
<p>And what the heck is a &ldquo;sanguine stage presence&rdquo; anyway?</p>
<p>But here was the kicker to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Part-Time, pay commensurate with experience)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a PART-TIME position.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you need to be able to write songs, orchestrate, build and lead a team, plan and arrange services including tracks and loops, rehearse, perform, meet with the church leadership on a regular basis, and in the best case would <strong>have an MDiv</strong>. For a part-time position.</p>
<p>Now, maybe I&rsquo;m just 39 and out of touch, and there will be a hundred qualified candidates beating down the door of Paramount Church to audition for this position. But really? Are these wise expectations for church music leading, or wise leadership burdens to place on a part-time leadership position?</p>
<p>I fear that so often in the evangelical American church we have set our music performance and production standards so high that the focus is on the production more than the actual act of congregational worship, and that none save the already-professional musicians need apply to participate as a part of the worship bands.</p>
<p><strong>Job posts like this feel like we&rsquo;re signing the Body of Christ up for plastic surgery when what we really need is just to get it to the gym for regular workouts.</strong></p>
<p>The church should be the incubator for and encourager of the young musicians coming up in it. I am biased here but can speak from a lifetime of having had that experience in the church. From singing special music with my dad and brothers when the youngest was so small he had to be held so he could be seen above the pulpit, to playing Bach for Sunday night offertories when I was just learning the piano, to leading worship teams in college when I was not nearly experienced enough, my musical development has been the product of a multitude of churches that didn&rsquo;t want professionalism so much as service.</p>
<p>Yes, some standards are appropriate. Some talent is needed. But let&rsquo;s not set our production standards so high that none but trained professionals can meet them. And let&rsquo;s not set our job expectations so high that we eliminate the talented amateurs from the conversation. The church can and should be developing these leaders from the inside. To always be searching for professionals from the outside is both unhealthy and unsustainable.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I made an observation on Twitter yesterday that I want to flesh out a little more.</p>
<p>[<em>twitter is gone, sorry. best guess as to what I was going on about by reading the paragraphs below.</em>]</p>
<p>Now, my experience is limited to the handful of evangelical churches I&rsquo;ve attended over the years. But in general I observe that we focus a <em>lot</em> on learning when it comes to doctrine and practice. Our pastors preach long, well-prepared and often academic sermons. We encourage Bible studies and recommend books from the beginner level to very advanced levels for study in all theological areas.</p>
<p>When we get to music in our worship services, though, we very often have a different approach: our music is very often chosen based on what is familiar to people from listening to Christian radio. Those old hymns with lots of big words and thick doctrine? Confusing. Singing parts out of hymnals? Nobody knows how to read music anymore. Why confuse them with the notes?</p>
<p>When we lose a vision for singing in church as a means of embedding truth in the hearts of each believer, we can be content with going for whatever is easy and familiar. When the goal is to entertain and get people &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; the worship before the pastor comes to preach, we are best served by grabbing whatever they&rsquo;re singing along with on the radio this week and having them sing it along with the praise band on Sunday.</p>
<p>Christian singing can be so much more than entertainment, though. Songs use music to ingrain words into our minds and hearts, and the great hymns of the Christian faith are full of truth to inspire, challenge, and comfort believers. Efforts to teach those hymns and how to sing them will result in a life-long benefit to those who will remember the truths in them long after they&rsquo;ve forgotten every Christian book they&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>Not all hymns are old, not all old songs are deserving, and there is still a place for singing entertaining songs. But favoring easy entertainment over formative singing will leave the body anemic and lacking.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This showed up in my Twitter feed over the weekend:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattmahermusic/status/764698400981864448">twitter.com/mattmaher&hellip;</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Worship Night in America&rdquo;. To <a href="https://twitter.com/cludlum/status/764844661500325888">quote my friend</a> Chrissy: &ldquo;NOPE. Big, big NOPE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dug into Tomlin&rsquo;s website for more details. Billed as &ldquo;An Evening of Unity and Prayer for Our Country&rdquo;, it features Tomlin along with musicians Matt Redman, Phil Wickham, and Matt Maher, along with speakers Max Lucado and Louie Giglio.</p>
<p>Event sites have been set up at theaters across the country - there are two listed in Iowa including one here in my hometown of Cedar Rapids - with tickets on pre-sale for $12. Per <a href="http://www.christomlin.com/faq">the FAQ</a>, these sites won&rsquo;t actually host the event unless some minimum number of tickets are sold in advance. For an additional $3.99 ($15.99 total) you can get a CD or digital copy of Chris Tomlin&rsquo;s new album along with the ticket.</p>
<p>Also from the FAQ: even though it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;one-night-only&rdquo; event, this is not some sort of live simulcast. &ldquo;Worship Night in America was created by Grammy-award winning artist Chris Tomlin&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the event was recorded at Madison Square Garden and edited for theaters and non-theatrical venues.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Where do I even start?</p>
<p><strong>The Title</strong></p>
<p>I gotta admit, when I hear &ldquo;Worship Night in America&rdquo;, the first thing I think of is &ldquo;Football Night in America&rdquo; - the tag line NBC uses for Sunday Night Football - and then quickly to &ldquo;Hockey Night in Canada&rdquo;. Hey folks, let&rsquo;s hype a trendy event! Who&rsquo;s got an idea for a name?</p>
<p><strong>The Medium</strong></p>
<p>First it started with video venues for churches - some local live staff, sure, but we&rsquo;ll pipe the popular preacher in from some other campus. Then came &ldquo;online church&rdquo; - just stream the service on your computer, submit your prayer requests via a web form, and tithe with your credit card, all from the comfort of your jammies and your couch! Now we have &ldquo;worship night&rdquo;, where we line up to sit in a theater and watch a pre-produced event from Madison Square Garden featuring only the hippest musicians and high-octane speakers.</p>
<p>Virtual ain&rsquo;t church, folks. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I see a huge value in (and have personally benefited greatly from) friendships cultivated primarily online. But the body of Christ is called to assemble <em>in person</em>, and there&rsquo;s a vast amount of encouragement, accountability, and support that can only really come with in-person assemblies. We&rsquo;re fooling ourselves if we try to argue otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>The Politics</strong></p>
<p>Any other year, I&rsquo;d be 95% certain that this sort of event, scheduled one week before the elections, was going to be leveraged to push attendees hard toward voting for a certain sort of Republican candidate. This year I&rsquo;m not quite so certain. The FAQ says that the event &ldquo;is not tied to any candidate or political affiliation&rdquo;, which is good. I guess I&rsquo;m cynical enough to assume that a flag-waving prayer-and-worship evangelical event the week before the election is another <em>&ldquo;If my people who are called by my name will GET OUT THE VOTE then I will heal their land&rdquo;</em> sort of event. I hope they prove me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>The Money</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no accident that the new Chris Tomlin record is slated to come out the same week as this event, and that attendees can get a copy for only $4 when bought in conjunction with the event ticket. In the same way authors can hit the bestseller list by engineering the sale of lots of copies of their book, musicians can hit a similar list with first week sales. So, 95 event sites listed at the moment. Say they each sell 200 tickets, and 50% of the ticket buyers also get a CD. That&rsquo;s nearly 10,000 copies of Tomlin&rsquo;s new album sold that week. That&rsquo;s not insubstantial.</p>
<p>Not that there&rsquo;s necessarily anything wrong with marketing and wanting to sell lots of records&hellip; but attendees should be aware that this &ldquo;evening of unity and prayer&rdquo; also looks to be a pre-produced marketing event to sell a lot of records.</p>
<h3 id="so-heres-a-thought">So here&rsquo;s a thought</h3>
<p>If you want an evening of unity and prayer leading up to election day - and Lord knows we could use both - invite some people from various churches in your community to get together. Make sure you invite some who have a different skin color or accent than you do. Have somebody bring along a guitar. Sing some songs you all know. (Or learn some of each others' songs!) Pray for each other and for your community. Listen to each others' stories. Make new friends.</p>
<p><em>That</em> will be a productive step toward building Christian unity in your community, far more than plunking down into a theater seat and singing along with the screen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I listen regularly to a handful of podcasts, and irregularly to a couple handfuls more. This past week I&rsquo;ve run across a couple episodes that I feel are particularly worth recommending:</p>
<h4 id="radiolab-presents-more-perfecthttpwwwwnycorgshowsradiolabmoreperfect-the-political-thickethttpwwwwnycorgstorythe-political-thicket"><a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect">Radiolab Presents: More Perfect</a>: <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/the-political-thicket/">&ldquo;The Political Thicket&rdquo;</a>.</h4>
<p>More Perfect is a short-run podcast (they plan to produce 7 episodes) by the wonderful folks at Radiolab that is focusing on the US Supreme Court. The Political Thicket is an episode about the 1962 <em>Baker vs. Carr</em> decision in which SCOTUS first really got involved in political decisions - in this case, by forcing Tennessee to reapportion legislative districts in a way that provided equal representation for both whites and blacks. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<h4 id="fresh-air-christopher-eccleston-on-the-a-word-and-rethinking-his-faith-after-the-leftovershttpwwwnprorg20160711485551725christopher-eccleston-on-the-a-word-and-rethinking-his-faith-after-the-leftovers"><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/07/11/485551725/christopher-eccleston-on-the-a-word-and-rethinking-his-faith-after-the-leftovers">Fresh Air: Christopher Eccleston On &lsquo;The A Word,&rsquo; and Rethinking His Faith After &lsquo;The Leftovers&rsquo;</a></h4>
<p>Fresh Air is hardly a novel or surprising podcast recommendation, but this Terry Gross interview with actor Christopher Eccleston was superb. I&rsquo;m really only familiar with Eccleston from his season playing the lead in Doctor Who, but after this interview I also really want to catch up with The Leftovers.</p>
<p>Eccleston talks frankly about his wrestling with faith, talking about how he&rsquo;s moved from an angry atheism to a more open viewpoint, and how the Biblical book of Job has loomed large in playing his character in The Leftovers. He also talks very personally about his struggles in relating to and caring for his father who suffered from dementia for 15 years before passing away in 2012.</p>
<p>A really fantastic interview - Terry Gross is of course a premier interviewer, and Eccleston is a very engaging and forthcoming subject. Worth 40 minutes.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been posting on every book I&rsquo;ve read, but wow, this was a good one.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/29yzHx2"><em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em></a> by Isabel Wilkerson is a history of what she calls &ldquo;America&rsquo;s great migration&rdquo; - the movement of African Americans from the south to northern, midwestern, and western urban areas between 1930 and 1970. She follows three primary characters through their journeys from the Jim Crow south to new jobs and lives in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Wilkerson weaves together their stories with the bigger picture of a changing country, where racial discrimination stubbornly persisted (persists?) even in states where the Jim Crow laws didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Given the unrest in the country at present this was a timely read. It struck home more than history often does because its time frame was so close to the present. It&rsquo;s easy for me to think of even the 1960s as an old, black-and-white time; each of the characters Wilkerson follows, though, live at least into the 1990s&hellip; which I remember well.</p>
<p>Our history in this country is short, and this book was a good reminder that the racial tension we have today isn&rsquo;t far removed from a long history of racism and slavery. We have so much yet to learn.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve hit a bit of a slowdown in my reading as the summer got busy, but have still made some progress on the book pile&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29f2rrg"><em>Porcelain: A Memoir</em></a> by Moby - Interesting stories, but what a sad trajectory. From the struggling musician trying to make his way in the world to an addict who makes light of being drunk and missing his mother&rsquo;s funeral, and brags about getting sexual favors from models in strung-out parties. Here&rsquo;s hoping God has a third act in plan for this guy&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29kCLwo"><em>Shaker</em></a> by Scott Frank - A not-particularly-memorable detective novel.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29wkRqu"><em>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia&rsquo;s Founding</em></a> by Robert Hughes - How awful was the culture around dealing with criminals in the 1700s in England? Awful. Maybe worse. First eye-opening, then disturbing, then almost tiresome&hellip; you can only read so much about how horrible things were for everyone (prisoners, guards, and aboriginals alike) without having to just stop.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29kDjmf"><em>Hamilton: The Revolution</em></a> by Lin-Manuel Miranda - notes and pictures about the Broadway production. Love it.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29wmlRc"><em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.</em></a> by Adelle Waldman - Wanna hate a self-absorbed protagonist? This is the book for you.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29m9ssd"><em>You Are What You Love: The Spiritual Power of Habit</em></a> by James K. A. Smith - A lay-level treatment of his big Kingdom book. Makes me want to go join a church that&rsquo;s serious about catechesis and liturgy.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29g3NCa"><em>Whose Body?</em> (Lord Peter Wimsey series, Book #1)</a> by Dorothy Sayers - I&rsquo;d never heard of this series before, but a couple librarian friends recommended it, and book 1 was enjoyable. Currently reading book 2.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29LTzet"><em>Humans of New York: Stories</em></a> by Brandon Stanton - continues the remarkable Humans of New York photo series, but enhanced with comments and stories from those photographed. A wonderful (and sometimes sobering) celebration of the joyous diversity of the human experience.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/29f4jjH"><em>Infomocracy</em></a> by Malka Ann Older - an interesting little novel postulating a future where an all-reaching Information service drives micro-democracies. As ever, the question is this: who watches the watchers?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the second Sayers novel, I&rsquo;m slowly working my way through Volume 1 of Pelikan&rsquo;s church history series and more quickly devouring Isabel Wilkerson&rsquo;s excellent <a href="http://amzn.to/29wnubK"><em>The Warmth of Other Suns</em></a>. More on that later.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2016/06/15/on-watching-the.html">On Watching the Tonys for the First Time</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2016/06/15/on-watching-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-06-15 07:42:12 -0500">Jun 15, 2016</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last Sunday night I sat down with my family and watched the <a href="http://www.tonyawards.com/index.html">Tony Awards</a> ceremony. (The Tonys are given out yearly to award the best in musical and stage theater, similar to the Oscars for film or the Grammys for music.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never watched the Tonys before. I&rsquo;m usually an Oscars guy, and every once in a while I&rsquo;ll watch the Grammys (or at least that year when Arcade Fire was up for a bunch of awards), but the Tonys? Nope.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com/">Hamilton</a> came along, and we had an excuse. It&rsquo;s been a bit of an obsession in our house, so an opportunity to see a performance from the show, and to see if it would win all the awards? Gotta watch it. (How much of an obsession, you ask? In our house, now, if the girls want to know the time, they will precisely ask &ldquo;what is the time?&rdquo;, because they know if they ask &ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo;, at least one member of the household will reply &ldquo;showtime!&rdquo;, which is invariably followed by &ldquo;like I said&hellip;&rdquo;. Every time.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtLKdQW40Xo">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>In retrospect I&rsquo;m not sure why I follow the Oscars every year. I follow film (via <a href="http://filmspotting.net">podcast</a> far more than I watch it. I guess I get a kick out of seeing the celebrities off the big screen, hearing the speeches, being able to discuss the ceremony the next day, whatever. But the Oscars ceremony has a history of being pretty awful. It runs long. The hosts are lame, or wooden, or both. The patter between presenters is forced. Depending on the year you might get a good musical number or two - the song from Selma brought down the house last year - but otherwise&hellip; it&rsquo;s more an event than a great show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9MKXR4gLjQ">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Enter the Tonys. What a fantastic awards show! Host James Corden was funny (and very talented!) without dragging any jokes out too long or being obnoxious. The show moved along at a good clip, full of musical numbers from the nominated musicals. Leading up to commercial breaks, a cast from one of the nominated shows would move to a little outside stage on the street to perform a quick bit from some other classic Broadway show. (This led, charmingly enough, to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber playing the tambourine to accompany Steve Martin on the banjo for one song. Not bad, Sir Andrew. Not bad.)</p>
<p>And the performances. Wow, the performances. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcXqdazKUf4">Carmen Cusack belting it out</a> in a number from Steve Martin and Edie Brickell&rsquo;s musical Bright Star. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh4tXAu5TIU">Audra McDonald singing and dancing</a> (while 4 or 5 months pregnant!) in Shuffle Along. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI6yRuHKuMc">big wedding dance number</a> from the revival of Fiddler on the Roof. And The Color Purple. Goodness me, The Color Purple.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puR2RXOGIi8">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Having tuned in to see Hamilton, what I found along with it was a theater full of incredibly talented people who, to all appearances, really love the music and dance, and who even between show casts share a great camaraderie. In contrast to the cool, cynical detachment often seen at the Oscars, the Tonys were enthusiastic, joyous, and intense.</p>
<p>And then there were moments of brilliance like Lin-Manuel Miranda&rsquo;s acceptance speech, which he provided in the form of a sonnet:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAG">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAG</a>_7qeiOZA</p>
<p>On the night after the horrific mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub, the Tony Awards show both acknowledged the loss and provided, if not some healing, at least a respite from the pain - an embrace saying <em>we are in this together and we will get through it</em>.</p>
<p>And when the Hamilton cast came back on stage for the closing number, and a good chunk of the audience stood up and sang along with them, the joy in their voices, faces, and dancing bodies shouted out that Miranda&rsquo;s lyrics hold a timeless truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple weeks back I linked to a two hour panel video discussing <a href="/16/05/the-worship-leader-as-pastoral-musician/">The Worship Leader as Pastoral Musician</a>. I&rsquo;ve finally gotten all the way through the video and want to highlight some thoughts from it that stuck out to me. The first one I want to talk about is <strong>Worship Pastor as Tour Guide</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sandravanopstal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/FinalSandra-680x1024-410x617.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This thought comes from <a href="http://www.sandravanopstal.com/">Sandra Maria Van Opstal</a>, who after 15 years with InterVarsity currently serves as Executive Pastor of <a href="http://www.thegapc.org/">The Grace and Peace Community</a>, a church community associated with the Christian Reform Church on the northwest side of Chicago. She says [around the 25:00 mark in the video]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that worship leaders are pastors means that we meet people where they are, and we&rsquo;re responsive to them, but we also lead people to new places where they need to go, and create spaces to introduce people to practices that form them&hellip;. It&rsquo;s like a tour guide. If you come to Chicago and you&rsquo;re really into sports, I&rsquo;m going to take you to all the stadiums, and show you all that stuff - I&rsquo;m not into it, but I&rsquo;ll take you, because I&rsquo;m a good tour guide. I&rsquo;m asking what is on your mind, what is important to you. And then, I&rsquo;m also gonna take you to places in my city that you don&rsquo;t even know exist, because they are fundamentally what it means to be in Chicago. You can&rsquo;t eat deep dish every time you go to Chicago. There is so much other food that exists there. So in the same way we as pastors don&rsquo;t only meet people where they&rsquo;re at&hellip; we also have to take them somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sandra goes on to talk about how this relates to addressing current events and issues, and leading a congregation to lament and open discussion rather than just ignoring the issues.</p>
<p>I also see an application for worship pastors as it relates to music selection and service content. Yes, we need to meet people where they are, to speak in their musical dialect, in the words of Sandra&rsquo;s metaphor, to show them the places they want to see. But we can&rsquo;t stop there. We then have to take them to where they <em>need to go</em> in worship and formation.</p>
<p>In my church&rsquo;s mission statement we talk about coming alongside people as they take their next step toward Jesus. This pastoral &ldquo;tour guide&rdquo; activity is placing an arm around their shoulders and helping them head in the right direction as they take that step. What a great picture.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve been in a sermon series on Revelation at church, so when a couple recommendations for <a href="http://amzn.to/24TXMWX"><em>Reading Revelation Responsibly</em></a> came across Twitter, I had to pick up a copy. <a href="http://www.michaeljgorman.net/">Dr. Michael J. Gorman</a>, the author, is a United Methodist professor of Biblical Studies and Theology at the very Roman Catholic St. Mary&rsquo;s Seminary and University in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>Gorman makes the case that the book of Revelation is a book of prophecy, but, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>prophecy, in the biblical tradition, is not exclusively or even primarily about making pronouncements and predictions concerning the future. Rather, prophecy is speaking words of comfort and/or challenge, on behalf of God, to the people of God in their concrete historical situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gorman suggests that Revelation encourages the church to resist the allure and pressure of un-sacred civil religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calling Revelation “resistance literature” is appropriate because one of the primary prophetic purposes of Revelation is to remind the church, both then and now, not to give in to the demands or practices of a system that is already judged by God and is about to come to its demise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One is reminded of N. T. Wright&rsquo;s line that saying &lsquo;Jesus is Lord&rsquo; was (is) a political statement, because if Jesus is Lord, then Caesar is not. Gorman argues that this un-sacred civil religion is similarly prevalent in modern America as it was in ancient Rome. As such, he says, the lesson for the church today is to resist the call of our civil (political) religion, because it will undoubtedly conflict with our call to follow Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The early church had a natural suspicion of Roman civil religion because it was so blatantly pagan and idolatrous—though even it could be appealing. Contemporary Christians can much more easily assume that Christian, or quasi-Christian, ideas, language, and practices are benign and even divinely sanctioned. This makes American civil religion all the more attractive—that is, all the more seductive and dangerous. Its fundamentally pagan character is masked by its Christian veneer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What becomes clear from Gorman is how timely the message of Revelation is for us today. Not because it is giving us some sort of end-of-days timeline, as the popular dispensational position would claim, but because it calls us to recognize the danger of buying in to any empire or lord except Jesus and His kingdom. Our systems of government and power today are modern representations of Babylon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Babylon makes promises, demands, and claims that are appropriate only for God to make.</strong> It sacralizes, even divinizes, its own power, and then it requires absolute allegiance to that power. The progression of this course, as Revelation 18 makes especially clear, is the pursuit of luxury and the neglect of the poor, first by Babylon itself, then by its clients, then by its everyday citizens. One inevitable result is the treatment of certain human beings as goods to be traded (18:13), and the elimination of others for their failure to offer absolute allegiance. Another is violence and war, death and destruction, hunger and famine (ch. 6). The final inevitable result is the destruction of the earth without fear of consequences, temporal or eternal (11:18).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I think Gorman has also probably read his Stringfellow - I&rsquo;m reminded of reading <a href="/12/01/william-stringfellow-an-ethic-for-christians-other-aliens-in-a-strange-land/"><em>An Ethic for Christians and Other Aliens In a Strange Land</em></a> a few years back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend <em>Reading Revelation Responsibly</em> for anyone who wants to give Revelation serious consideration. It&rsquo;s not a difficult book - 10 chapters, and written at what might be considered just a slightly advanced popular level. It&rsquo;s an insightful, encouraging volume that&rsquo;s worth the time.</p>

			 <p>As a follow-up to <a href="/16/05/brian-zahnds-prayer-school/">yesterday&rsquo;s post about Prayer School</a> I wanted to spend a little bit of time discussing Pastor Brian and Word of Life Church (WOLC) directly. As someone who has really enjoyed Brian&rsquo;s teaching via podcast, one of the questions I went in to the weekend asking myself was &ldquo;If I lived in St. Joseph, could I find myself attending this church?&rdquo; And right behind it was asking like I have about many guys I&rsquo;ve listened to in podcasts: &ldquo;is this guy and his ministry legit?&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="so-about-the-church">So, about the church</h3>
<p>I had a couple opportunities over the weekend to get insight into the church. At the lunch hour on Friday we were invited to take a tour of the building. Then on Friday night we had the opportunity to attend their regular Friday night service.</p>
<p>The building itself seems to speak to the history of Zahnd and WOLC. The auditorium is huge - it seats somewhere north of 2000 people - and there is a separate multi-purpose auditorium where they hold Friday night worship. The other notable feature is &ldquo;The Upper Room&rdquo;, a (ground-level) prayer chapel made of Jerusalem limestone that seats about 50. (This is where the prayer school was held.)</p>
<p>When we got a tour, we got the full tour. We saw backstage areas, back hallways, tech rooms, utility closets, the pastor&rsquo;s study - pretty much everything. We were told they have built the church in several sections over the years. The building has a quality of fading opulence which likely reflects Zahnd&rsquo;s own personal move from a sort of flashier Pentecostalism (a role which you can easily enough picture him in) to a more eclectic Anabaptism. The tech room holds the same message - full of video production equipment that was state-of-the-art in the early 90&rsquo;s and basically obsolete today. (At one point the church&rsquo;s Sunday services were produced for cable TV - that was discontinued some years ago due to the cost.) It seems clear that Zahnd&rsquo;s new focus and approach likely caused a significant drop in attendance and budget, and WOLC has had to do a sort of fiscal reset to go in the new direction.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-man">About the man</h3>
<p>With the rise and fall of so many celebrity preachers, I came in wondering whether Zahnd might be falling into the celebrity trap, too. On this count I was encouraged. On one hand, WOLC is clearly <em>his</em> church. He planted it over 30 years ago and continues to pastor it today. On the other hand, the other church leaders and members didn&rsquo;t seem to have him on a pedestal. He comfortably mingled with the prayer school attendees during breaks and answered questions. He could seem aloof from time to time, but I&rsquo;m going to attribute that to personality and the burden of teaching all weekend. (Two sessions Friday, sermon Friday night, session Saturday morning, different sermon on Sunday morning&hellip; I&rsquo;d be tired, too!) While I didn&rsquo;t have more than a passing conversation with him, I did have a lengthy talk with associate pastor Derek Vreeland, an energetic and slightly younger guy (probably mid 40s) who seemed to be very much his own man and not in Zahnd&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
<p>The one place that made me just a bit uneasy was the pastor&rsquo;s study. Compared to the rest of the staff offices that are nice but not fancy, Zahnd&rsquo;s study is <em>plush</em>. Two rooms, fireplace, leather chairs, built-in bookshelves from floor to ceiling, fancy rug on the floor&hellip; don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I was a little jealous, but it did seem somewhat out of character with the rest of the building. I&rsquo;m guessing that it, too, is a relic of WOLC&rsquo;s Pentecostal incarnation and maybe not reflective of their current priorities.</p>
<h3 id="could-i-worship-there">Could I worship there?</h3>
<p>I recognize this is a very subjective question. I really appreciated the fact that they scheduled the prayer school so that attendees could also attend the Friday night service. (Many came from several hours away and stayed for the full weekend, attending the Sunday service as well.) It was, as Brian said, a chance to get &ldquo;the full WOLC experience&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The structure of the Friday night service wasn&rsquo;t unfamiliar to me - the same sort of songs, announcements, greeting, and offering that you&rsquo;d find in any typical evangelical church service. Sprinkled into the service, though, were some more ancient elements of liturgy - use of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, a longer Gospel reading, a prayer from the Book of Common Prayer, and corporate confession before Communion.</p>
<p>The music was pretty loud and the congregation still fairly charismatic - lots of hands in the air and people bouncing on the balls of their feet, clapping between songs. The songs themselves were (save for one) unfamiliar to me - I&rsquo;m guessing they are original songs by the church worship leader. The content of the songs was really good, though focused differently than I&rsquo;m used to. To say that Zahnd is not a fan of penal substitutionary atonement is an understatement, so you won&rsquo;t find songs here about Jesus' blood paying for your sins. There were many, though, about God&rsquo;s love and mercy, and His desire for righteousness and justice. The songs were <em>good</em>, just different than what I&rsquo;m used to.</p>
<p>The highlight of the service was the invitation to the Lord&rsquo;s Supper after the sermon. Zahnd&rsquo;s usual pattern is to wrap the sermon up in a way that leads to the table. He leads the congregation in corporate confession (straight from the BCP) and then invites the congregation to come forward and partake. There was one serving team for each section of seats, and ushers dismissed by rows to provide some order. I appreciated the egalitarian focus in the teams serving - for each seating section there was a man and a woman serving. In the middle section where I was seated, Pastor Brian&rsquo;s wife Peri served the bread (&ldquo;the body of Christ, broken for you&rdquo;) and Brian held the cup (&ldquo;the blood of Christ shed for you&rdquo;). I&rsquo;m also a huge fan of communion taken by congregants going forward rather than trays being served, both for the communal experience of going forward and for the powerful moment where someone looks you in the eye and reminds you that Christ&rsquo;s body was broken for <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>So, could I attend WOLC? I don&rsquo;t know. If I lived there and it were just me, I probably would. I&rsquo;m not sure my wife would be a big fan, and have no idea what all they have for children&rsquo;s ministries and the like. But just on the basis of the worship service? Yep.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-guy-legit">Is this guy legit?</h3>
<p>On one hand it seems arrogant of me to ask and answer this question. But I&rsquo;m going to try to do so from a posture of humility, with the goal being to encourage those others who have become fans of Zahnd from afar and may have similar questions. Happily, I can report that from my (admittedly brief) experience at WOLC, Pastor Brian&rsquo;s ministry appears to be legit and healthy. (To still be the pastor after 35 years and a major theological shift, he must be doing <em>something</em> right!) While the building itself holds vestiges of obsolete ministry priorities, the new ministry priorities seem well focused on important topics.</p>
<p>All in all, I was very encouraged by my weekend at Word of Life Church, and would love to go back sometime. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m going to keep Zahnd&rsquo;s sermons cued up in my podcast app.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A month ago I had the opportunity to attend the Prayer School weekend taught by Brian Zahnd at Word of Life Church in St. Joseph, MO. I&rsquo;ve intended to write up some thoughts on it ever since, but maybe it&rsquo;s been good to let things percolate a little while first. So many thoughts.</p>
<p>First, a little bit about Brian, since it&rsquo;s hard for me to separate him from the prayer school. I found Brian through his sermon podcast, which I&rsquo;ve listened to fairly regularly for a little over a year now. His story includes planting a Pentecostal church in his 20s, seeing it grow successfully, hitting something of a mid-life faith crisis in his 40s, whereupon he took a harder, broader look at theology. His teaching retains pieces of his charismatic background while embracing liturgy (&ldquo;good liturgy&rdquo;, he would say), the Book of Common Prayer, pacifism, and a strong sense of progressive revelation. He details this story in his recent book <a href="http://amzn.to/1rvN4nD"><em>Water to Wine</em></a>, which I&rsquo;d happily recommend as, if nothing else, a wonderful faith story.</p>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to share my thoughts directly about the prayer school; in a future post I want to follow up with a few thoughts about Zahnd and Word of Life church directly, since I got the feeling many attending, and probably many who have read his books or listened to the podcast, are curious about the man and his ministry.</p>
<h3 id="prayer-school">Prayer School</h3>
<p><em>[Initial note: Brian only teaches these classes in person - no recordings are distributed. He says he believes it&rsquo;s something that should be passed along as &lsquo;secrets&rsquo; from person to person. I&rsquo;ll respect that and not go into tremendous detail. However, there&rsquo;s nothing too unfamiliar there if you&rsquo;ve listened to his podcast over the past year or so.]</em></p>
<p>Zahnd organizes the prayer school into three sessions, held Friday morning, Friday afternoon, and Saturday morning. (Word of Life Church holds a regular Friday night service which we were also encouraged to attend.) Through those sessions he teaches (and models) prayer not as &ldquo;getting God to do what you want&rdquo; but as a way to be &ldquo;properly formed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He encourages the use of prayers that have been written through church history both as good prayers that allow us to learn from our forefathers, and as ways to teach us to pray better when we pray extemporaneously. Brian uses a musical metaphor likening these rote prayers to a guitarist practicing scales. You don&rsquo;t always play just the scales, he says, but if you haven&rsquo;t practiced your scales over and over, when you get to play the second verse guitar solo, you&rsquo;re not gonna do very well.</p>
<p>In the final session Brian talks about contemplative prayer, which he likes to call &ldquo;sitting with Jesus&rdquo;. (He&rsquo;s preached sermons with similar titles if you&rsquo;re really curious.) For this topic he draws on a long line of contemplatives in the spirit of Thomas Merton.</p>
<p>The whole class is structured around a morning liturgy of prayer which he challenges everyone to try for 6 weeks. It includes daily Bible readings, weekly prayers from the BCP, rote prayers including that of St. Francis, and time for personal petition and contemplation.</p>
<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>A good bit of what drew me to attend the prayer school in the first place was this seemingly odd combination of liturgy, old prayers, and contemplation. What a mix! And in that I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. Zahnd is a talented teacher, though if I were going to try to describe his personality and approach I might start by referencing some Old Testament prophet instead of a teacher. There&rsquo;s an air of confident, in-your-face declaration that was a bit of a shock to this guy who is used to long brainy sermons.</p>
<p>I really like the emphasis on using and learning from the prepared prayers. The Book of Common Prayer is full of beautiful language and really meaningful prayers and is a rich treasury that today&rsquo;s church should draw on. (I&rsquo;m a sucker for the musical metaphor, too.)</p>
<p>Zahnd makes a compelling case for using rote prayers from Acts 2:42, which in the NIV is translated</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he points out, in the Greek it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;prayer&rdquo; but &ldquo;the prayers&rdquo;, definite article, plural. (I looked it up in an interlinear online, and sure enough, he&rsquo;s right.) And devoting one&rsquo;s self to &ldquo;the prayers&rdquo; is a horse of a different color than &ldquo;prayer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done a very good job of taking up Pastor Brian&rsquo;s six-week challenge so far. I&rsquo;ve used the liturgy inconsistently a few times per week, often getting distracted by my schedule. However, I still feel the draw to use it more regularly, so I&rsquo;m going to try to make it a priority. Where previously the idea of spending 20-30 minutes in prayer was incomprehensible to me - I&rsquo;d be out of ideas after 5 minutes! - with this liturgy I can easily spend 20-30 minutes in reading and prayer, which is great. I just need to find a way to make it a habit.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more I&rsquo;d like to write but I&rsquo;ll save it for a follow-up post.</p>

			 <p>Today is May 4th, which has gained an online buzz as &ldquo;Star Wars Day&rdquo; - &ldquo;May the Fourth be with you&rdquo; and all that. (My friend Geof isn&rsquo;t a fan, but we all knew he&rsquo;d become a curmudgeon sooner or later.)</p>
<p>A better idea, though, came through on Twitter this morning:</p>

<p>(Thanks, Bethany, for RTing that into my timeline!)</p>
<p>So, in honor of 5/4 day, my favorite 5/4 song that isn&rsquo;t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs">Take Five</a>:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Sawyer&rsquo;s stuff to this point, and this one wasn&rsquo;t bad&hellip; but not great either. A sort of fascinating concept - quantum states within the brain as the cause of consciousness - but how it plays out is somewhat horrifying.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/23Lburb"><em>The Bible Tells Me So: Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It</em> by Peter Enns</a></p>
<p>This is Enns' popular-level treatment of the subject he&rsquo;s addressed in more scholarly detail elsewhere - namely, his take on how to interpret biblical (primarily Old Testament) texts that seem contradictory - whether that be contradicting other biblical texts, or the historical/archaeological record, or the conclusions of science. I appreciate that he wrote a popular-level book, and agree with many of his perspectives, but at times I wished he written it with more sensitivity towards those who are coming from a more conservative perspective. There&rsquo;s a lot of things along the lines of &ldquo;of <em>course</em> those are obviously contradictions, what&rsquo;s up with that?&rdquo; sort of attitude that might turn off people who&rsquo;d otherwise be helped by the book. Still, worth reading.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/23Let2K"><em>Beauty Will Save the World: Rediscovering the Allure and Mystery of Christianity</em> by Brian Zahnd</a></p>
<p>I picked this one up while attending Zahnd&rsquo;s prayer school a couple weeks ago. (Yeah, I need to write a separate post about that.) Here Zahnd urges us to rediscover the <em>beauty</em> of Christian belief from amidst the American Christian culture&rsquo;s desire to over-analyze and have an explanation for everything. The last two chapters alone were completely worth the price of the book. Good stuff.</p>

			 <p>A couple friends shared this old compilation video of Fred Rogers appearing on the Charlie Rose interview show, and while my memories of watching Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, while definitely present, are indistinct at best, I couldn&rsquo;t help but spend 15 minutes listening to it. What struck me this time wasn&rsquo;t so much Mr. Rogers' lovely insights into life, but in how uncomfortable Charlie Rose looks performing the interview.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/djoyd46TVVc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>First - and I may just be imagining this, but I don&rsquo;t think so - Rose is challenged by Rogers' deliberate pace. Rose&rsquo;s normal tempo is likely something a lot faster, but Rogers refuses to be hurried. And through the interview clip you hear Rose start to slow down, never quite reaching Rogers' slow cadence, but certainly influenced by his quiet and calm.</p>
<p>Second, and more profoundly, Rose seems ill at ease, I think, simply because he recognizes in Rogers a spiritual and emotional quality that he wishes he had himself. Quickly behind that is the thought that the absence of those qualities is a real personal shortcoming somehow.</p>
<p>To say it much more simply: <strong>this is the discomfiting presence of a saint.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of Paul&rsquo;s words in 2 Corinthians 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But thanks be to God, who&hellip; uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those of us who recognize and embrace the presence of Christ in Rogers' life, it is a pleasing aroma - one that makes encourages and challenges us. To those who don&rsquo;t, it can be deeply troubling. My desire is to live with such an awareness of Christ in my life that I, too, could have a transformative presence like Mr. Rogers did.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2016/03/30/finished-reading-partners.html">Finished reading: Partners in Christ: A Conservative Case for Egalitarianism by John G. Stackhouse Jr.</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2016/03/30/finished-reading-partners.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-03-30 07:08:17 -0500">Mar 30, 2016</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I put this one on my Amazon wishlist after reading a few <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2015/10/20/whose-side-are-you-on/">posts on Scot McKnight&rsquo;s blog</a> about it. Shortly thereafter my Mom bought it for me for my birthday. Thanks Mom!</p>
<p>I appreciate the direction Dr. John Stackhouse takes with <a href="http://amzn.to/1PrGTVv"><em>Partners in Christ</em></a>. He wants to maintain a faithful, high view of Scripture; not to dismiss difficult passages or write them off, but to look at the Scripture as a whole and try to come to a position on male/female roles/dynamics in the church.</p>
<p>The title gives his conclusion away: Stackhouse comes down on the side of egalitarianism - in other words, that men and women should have equal standing and ability to have leadership roles in the church. But wait, the reader will say, what about 1 Timothy 2 (&ldquo;I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet&rdquo;) or 3 (&ldquo;an Elder shall be the husband of one wife&rdquo;)? Well, Stackhouse counters, what about 1 Cor 11 which assumes that women will be praying and prophesying? Or about Priscilla, who with her husband Aquila taught Apollos? Or Junia, who is mentioned among &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo; in Romans 16?</p>
<p>Stackhouse has an interesting approach here, which on first read makes a lot of sense - that God has an ideal end state in mind, and that at each era through history he has revealed himself and his will in ways that would stretch his people toward that end state without snapping them past the breaking point.</p>
<p>So, in the Old Testament, God reveals himself to the Israelites as a god in many ways different, though in many ways similar to the gods of the countries around them. He establishes a sacrificial system that is different, not but <em>that</em> different. When Jesus comes, he chooses men as his apostles, because choosing any women would&rsquo;ve been a challenge past the stretching point of the culture. Still, he challenged the status quo by treating women more as equals than anyone in that culture would have.</p>
<p>So, Stackhouse argues, while Paul writes directing how men would be leaders in the church, that direction isn&rsquo;t intended to be fixed for all time, but was the accommodation of the church to the culture at the time.</p>
<p>Stackhouse acknowledges that some will want to take this argument and run with it down other controversial paths, e.g. the debate over homosexuality. He differentiates that case by saying that the Bible appears to be progressively loosening on the gender equality issue, while staying consistent in its position regarding homosexuality.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna need to do a re-read and think through it some more, but I appreciated Dr. Stackhouse&rsquo;s take here. Worth a read if you&rsquo;re interested in the subject.</p>

			 <p>I picked up <a href="http://amzn.to/1RuI8e7">The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine, Vol. 2: The Spirit of Eastern Christendom (600-1700) (Volume 2)</a> from an online recommendation, not really knowing what I was getting myself into. Sure, I was diving into Volume 2 of a 5-volume set, but hey, why not?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d heard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaroslav_Pelikan">Pelikan&rsquo;s</a> name before but really knew nothing about him. But it didn&rsquo;t take long after starting the book to realize the immense brilliance of the author. The book starts with a list of primary sources, texts from the 7th - 17th centuries&hellip; that list is several pages long. (The list of secondary sources at the end is probably twice as long. Goodness.) Pelikan blessedly eschews footnotes in favor of a wide margin design where all the references are annotated in the margin, aligned with the relevant text. And goodness, there are references.</p>
<p>Pelikan manages pull together these sources to overview the development of Christian thought in the Eastern Church that is both detailed and accessible. In my terms, that means I couldn&rsquo;t skim - had to pay attention - but it kept me interested and engaged. Which is awesome. I enjoyed it enough that I ordered Volume 1&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I end up with all of them by the time I&rsquo;m done.</p>

			 <p>Scott Sauls, pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, has a really good piece from earlier this week titled <a href="http://scottsauls.com/2016/03/12/down-with-moral-majority-thinking-the-case-for-a-truer-christianity/">&ldquo;No More Moral-Majority Thinking&rdquo;</a> in which he explores how the church&rsquo;s influence in the culture should be viewed through Jesus' metaphor &ldquo;You are the salt of the earth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Salt, he notes, when taken in by itself, offends the senses. It&rsquo;s bitter and raises your blood pressure. But when it is a &ldquo;minority ingredient&rdquo;, it can bring out the best in the culture around it. He traces through history, pointing out that the church grew quickly under the persecution of the early Romans, but then became empty when Constantine established it as a state religion.</p>
<p>Sauls argues that rather than trying to drive Christian principles through government, American Christians should instead focus on being that salty, enhancing presence in the culture that leaves the world better than we found it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many examples of this. All of the Ivy League universities except for one were founded by Christians. Let’s keep doing that. Many hospital names begin with the word “Saint,” pointing to their Christian beginnings. Let’s keep doing that. As secular journalist Nicholas Kristof says, evangelical Christians are the most self-giving, exemplary servants to the world’s poor. Let’s keep doing that. Rembrandt painted world class paintings. Beethoven and Handel made world class music. Dostoevsky wrote world class literature. Let’s keep doing that. Evangelical leader Kevin Palau recently partnered with the openly gay mayor of Portland to resource and bless an under-served public school. Let’s keep doing that. A little Baptist church in Texas pooled funds together to pay for an outspoken, anti-Christian atheist’s medical needs. Let’s keep doing that. But what if people misunderstand our intent? What if by associating with non-believers in such intimate ways, people begin to think we are soft on truth? If we must choose, and sometimes we must, it is better to be misunderstood and labeled as too soft on sin, than it is to be misunderstood as self-righteous, harsh and strict. Jesus was regularly accused of being a glutton and a drunk, even though he was neither. Why? Because Jesus lived his life around drunks, prostitutes, shady tax collectors, and the like…and never felt the need to explain himself. Jesus welcomed sinners and ate with them (Luke 15:1-2). Mustn’t we?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this reminder that Christians have indeed served the culture in amazing, caring ways to serve people in Jesus' name. My only hesitation is his assertion that &ldquo;salty&rdquo; Christianity &ldquo;always does best&rdquo; as a minority. Which historically may be true, but it raises a question in my mind.</p>
<p>I think it was the <a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/category/mere-fidelity/">Mere Fidelity</a> guys who talked about this at some point, but - sure, it&rsquo;s great to be the minority element, the prophet calling out the sinful king and culture&hellip; but what happens if/when the king repents? How does Christianity work itself out in people who get elected to high office?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a hypothetical point, and that Christianity always has been and always will be a minority, but to say it only really works well as a minority seems like an overstatement. <em>Someday</em> Christianity won&rsquo;t be a minority. Of course, things will be a little different then.</p>
<p>Still, a really good piece from Pastor Sauls. Worth reading <a href="http://scottsauls.com/2016/03/12/down-with-moral-majority-thinking-the-case-for-a-truer-christianity/">the whole thing</a>.</p>

			 <p>I had three books going in parallel before finishing these two, which was making me twitchy. (Now I&rsquo;m back to one at a time. <em>Ahhhhh.</em>)</p>
<h4 id="_the-bone-labyrinth_-by-james-rollinshttpamznto1pudi9v"><a href="http://amzn.to/1pudi9v"><em>The Bone Labyrinth</em> by James Rollins</a></h4>
<p>Random selection off the library shelf. Apparently this is number 11 in a series, but read fine as a stand-alone thriller. The writing itself was good, though the story was sort of a disappointing Michael Crichton / DaVinci Code mashup. Quick, reasonably entertaining read, but I find myself unlikely to pick up another one by Rollins.</p>
<h4 id="_man-enough-how-jesus-redefines-manhood_-by-nate-pylehttpamznto1qy10yp"><a href="http://amzn.to/1QY10yP"><em>Man Enough: How Jesus Redefines Manhood</em> by Nate Pyle</a></h4>
<p>In a generation of <em>Wild at Heart</em>-esque books on Christian manhood, where wilderness adventure and military activity are primary examples pushed as &ldquo;how to be more like a man&rdquo;, pastor Nate Pyle&rsquo;s book is a breath of fresh air. Pyle emphasizes gentleness, vulnerability, and a focus on the example of Jesus as better qualities to pursue. This is a short, easy read that I&rsquo;d enjoy sneaking into a pastor&rsquo;s hand the next time they&rsquo;re pushing men&rsquo;s small groups.</p>

			 <p>I picked <a href="http://amzn.to/1QKFYkU"><em>The Mechanical</em></a> by Ian Tregillis off the library shelf on a whim. Well, more accurately, I picked up the <em>second</em> book in this series on a whim, saw that it was book 2, and then went and tracked down book 1, <em>The Mechanical</em>. It was time for some sci-fi/fantasy.</p>
<p>This story is set in an alternate past wherein the Dutch have invented &ldquo;mechanicals&rdquo; - sentient robot humanoids that are governed (or enslaved, depending on your perspective) by Asimovian rules of behavior that all work just great until one of them develops free will.</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation are the French who lack the mechanical alchemy and have retreated to Canada where they work on chemical solutions to fight the Dutch &ldquo;Clackers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good concept and Tregillis writes brisk prose and keeps it interesting. I enjoyed this one, and now need to go find Book 2 in the series again. I wonder what are the odds that it&rsquo;s still on the library shelf?</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been finishing books faster than I&rsquo;ve been able to blog about them&hellip; so here&rsquo;s a catch-up post.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1n1jVxD"><em>Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety</em></a> by Eric Schlosser</p>
<p>Schlosser&rsquo;s book alternates chapters between telling the story of an accident at a nuclear missile site in Damascus, Arkansas, and telling the history of the development of nuclear weapons, with a focus on the accidents and risks involved. Though it&rsquo;s not his point, one can quickly conclude that it&rsquo;s only by the grace of God we haven&rsquo;t had a major nuclear incident in the past 70 years. A fairly thick volume, but quite readable.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1R6UHGr">*Deadly Assets (Badge of Honor, #12)</a> by W.E.B. Griffin</p>
<p>Ah, W.E.B. Griffin, falling into the &lsquo;hey, they keep giving me money when the books have my name on them&rsquo; trap. A decade ago his books were still involved and engaging; today the plot lines are thin and the margins are wide. Remind me not to bother the next time I see one of his volumes on the library shelf.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1n1ksjl"><em>The Perfect Theory: A Century of Geniuses and the Battle over General Relativity</em></a> by Pedro G. Ferreira</p>
<p>A fun, popular-level overview of the study of General Relativity from Einstein to the present. I finished this on an airplane earlier this week and any sense of nerdiness I might&rsquo;ve had from the topic quickly slipped away as the guy in the seat next to me was reading some treatise on string theory. Nevertheless, a good survey of the topic.</p>
<p>A reminder that current events can make even recent books seem a bit out of date: the chapter on gravity waves talked about <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">LIGO</a> but was still in the &ldquo;maybe someday&rdquo; stage about actual detection of gravity waves&hellip; which <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211">LIGO announced earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1n1l0pk"><em>Water to Wine: Some of My Story</em></a> by Brian Zahnd</p>
<p>Brian Zahnd is a beautiful conundrum of a pastor and writer. Got fired up for Jesus as a kid in the 70s, planted and led a Pentecostal church. In this book he tells, as he says, some of his story as he hit a mid-life crisis of sorts, asked himself &ldquo;is this all there is to Christianity?&rdquo; and then had his eyes opened to a broader, deeper, richer view of the faith.</p>
<p>This is a guy who on one hand sounds like a mystic - he tells here of God speaking to him through dreams where he met with and got messages from Abraham, Mother Teresa, and Karl Barth - but in the next breath is championing formal liturgy, weekly Eucharist, and use of the Book of Common Prayer. He loves the land of Israel and can speak of it in great detail, but doesn&rsquo;t hold to the dispensational eschatology that traditionally accompanies that love.</p>
<p>Regardless, his sermons have been a great encouragement to me over the past couple years. This book rehearses familiar themes from his messages, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our hearts are made like pendulums, and when we swing away from one thing, we tend to end up on the far opposite site. Passionate devotion to a certain viewpoint turns to total disdain, even embarrassment. <em>I can’t believe that used to make sense to me. I can’t believe I used to say “epic” so much. I can’t believe I wore a t-shirt with a giant bloody picture of Jesus on the cross on the front. To school. (“He did this for you,” the t-shirt said.)</em> It’s easy to be hard on the person you were; it’s easier still to be hard on the people who are still there, who still see it this way, who still find comfort in the phrases that make you chafe. It’s easy to believe that they’re wrong and you’re right; that they’re stuck, and you’re enlightened. It’s easy to look back at them with a mix of pity and pride, as though they are somehow behind you on the journey. I don’t think that’s true.</p>

			 <p>My wife indulged her philately habit and purchased a big box of old stamps at a garage sale some months back. Along with the stamps in the old cardboard box was a pile of letters that the previous collector had received over the years.

It reminds us of the verse which Jesus taught us. &ldquo;I am the Vine, ye are the branches.&rdquo; Is it not true that inasmuch as branches into the one Vine and became one in love and purpose? Let us discard our doubts and predudices and try to learn good things of other nations that we may come up nearer to this ideal. And let us continue in our common hope and aim in preparation for the day when we must take greater responsibility in the builing up of a better world. Hoping that you are always enjoying good health. Your sincerely will send me the cinema magazine, the new&rsquo;s magazine the new&rsquo;s papers and new [indistinct] American Picture Cards and I wish you a Happy Christmas and Happy returns of them. I am your loving nephew. I am dear friend. Always at your command with kind regards [signed] TEISUKE ISHIDA My address Mr. Teisuke Ishida c/o Kurihara &amp; co Hichame Kitakyutaramachi Higoshiku Osaka Japan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have so many questions about this. How did Mr. Horford of Cedar Rapids, IA, have a Japanese nephew? What&rsquo;s the background that this nephew happened to be (apparently) a Christian when that was very rare in Japan? What happened to Mr. Ishida and this friendship when the US and Japan went to war just two years later?</p>
<p>For now I&rsquo;ll just have to be content with the letter.</p>

			 <p>I picked this one off the New Books shelf at the library and was intrigued enough to borrow it. <a href="http://amzn.to/1SxWV7v"><em>The Best of All Possible Worlds</em></a> by Karen Lord is a gentle sci-fi story focused on culture exploration in the same vein of the later books of Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s <em>Ender</em> series or some of the works of Ursula K. LeGuin. The cover blurb is a little bit misleading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A proud and reserved alien society finds its homeland destroyed in an unprovoked act of aggression&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah&hellip; that happens on the first page. The remainder of the story is a more subtle story about relationships being built between different cultures. It was an enjoyable read.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in the Supreme Court ever since high school, so when I saw this one on the library shelf, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate in picking it up. Last year I read a book about Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the Supreme Court; this year I learn about the first two women to serve on that bench.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1QWw41q"><em>Sisters in Law: How Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Went to the Supreme Court and Changed the World</em></a> is giving away a bit of its bias even in the title. It&rsquo;s a very nice history of these two groundbreaking women. It fascinated me to learn more about their backstories to add color to the faces you usually only see in stern portraits staring out from above black judicial robes.</p>
<p>It was interesting to learn about Ginsburg&rsquo;s path to the court and how it paralleled Thurgood Marshall&rsquo;s in many ways. Marshall was a tireless advocate for the African American cause as a lawyer before the Court before becoming a member; Ginsburg similarly championed the cause of equal rights for women. These backstories help remind us that even though the news stories about Court justices usually focus only on very recent legal opinions, appointment to the highest bench comes as the culmination of a long, brilliant legal career. These are impressive women with wonderful stories.</p>
<p>Author Hirshman is hardly a neutral observer here; she cheerleads for O&rsquo;Connor and Ginsburg all through the volume. It&rsquo;s tolerable until the last few chapters, at which point she speaks so critically and dismissively of conservative justice Samuel Alito that I nearly decided to put the book down. The opening bulk of the book, though, made it worthwhile.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll be honest here: I&rsquo;ve never been a big Bob Dylan fan. I like a few of his songs, but have somehow never managed to get into him as an artist. (I&rsquo;ll keep trying.) <a href="http://amzn.to/1K8B6c3"><em>Dylan Goes Electric! Newport, Seeger, Dylan, and the Night that Split the Sixties</em></a> by Elijah Wald is a short history of the American folk music scene in the early 1960s, leading up to that night in 1964 when Dylan brought an electric guitar on stage at the Newport Folk Festival and shook up the folk music scene for good.</p>
<p><em>Dylan Goes Electric</em> is very readable, and does a nice job of filling in the musical history of the era for people like me who have heard the names Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Peter, Paul and Mary, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the like, but know very little about most of them.</p>
<p>Nothing too deep or too profound, but a nice snapshot of a particular short era in American folk and popular music.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The church is not a special interest group that has to make its demands known. We don&rsquo;t have to fight for our rights. That is the exact opposite of the Jesus way. The church is the new temple that is sustained by the Spirit and by lives of faith, and the church can afford to be quiet and trust because it is not dependent on anything other than the Holy Spirit. The church doesn&rsquo;t have to make things happen. It can simply be that part of the world living under the peaceable reign of Christ. In fact <strong>I would highly advocate we reduce the hyperbole when we talk about &lsquo;changing the world&rsquo;.</strong> That just wears me out. &lsquo;Change the world&rsquo;? Wow, who do you think I am? I think I am far more content just to say &lsquo;let us be that part of the world that has been changed by Christ.&rsquo; <strong>Instead of changing the world, let&rsquo;s just be the part of the world that is changed.</strong> And think that maybe people might notice a difference and say &lsquo;I like that world of Christ better!&rsquo; <strong>For if there is no marked distinction between the world and us then what would be the point anyway?</strong> That&rsquo;s when &lsquo;changing the world&rsquo; becomes a euphemism for &lsquo;getting my way&rsquo;. <strong>Christ doesn&rsquo;t call His church to go into the world and get its way; Christ calls His church to simply be His people in the midst of the world and living presently under the peaceable reign of Christ.</strong> So in a world that must surely be growing weary of the endless noise of ideological anger, <strong>the church is to be a haven of quietness and trust, a quiet refuge of peace, even at times an oasis of silence.</strong> <strong>The sound of the church is the sound of mustard seeds growing, and of bread rising, of lost children coming home, and what noise there is a joyful noise, not an angry noise.</strong></p>

<p>I love it. Really looking forward to attending Brian&rsquo;s prayer conference in April.</p>

			 <p>O. Alan Noble has <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2016/february-web-only/to-hope-all-things-about-american-voter.html">a really good piece over on the CT website about the importance of Christians being careful about the truth</a>, especially when it comes to political debates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard a story recently about a fairly well-known evangelical figure who was confronted about public statements he had made in writing and interviews&hellip; When the facts became overwhelming, this influential evangelical conceded that he had been playing fast and loose with facts. However, since his overall message was true and important, he reasoned, it was justifiable to fudge the details in order to motivate voters to make the right decision. &hellip; The belief that American voters must be manipulated rather than reasoned with if we want to institute any meaningful change is endemic. But this belief is essentially nihilist because it makes all political discourse a matter of coercion, a matter of who is doing the coercing and to what ends. I call this nihilist because it makes power, not truth, goodness, or beauty, the foundation of politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I like to say: words matter.</p>
<p>I am sure I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this sort of generalizing and overstating positions of people I disagree with - so here&rsquo;s my renewed commitment to not do so. Let us speak the truth, be honest about the facts, and trust that God is at work.</p>
<p>Especially in this election year.</p>

			 <p>This one was kinda hidden in those photos I posted yesterday. But after wading through Heim I was ready for a shorter, easy read, and <a href="http://amzn.to/1P8HVsN"><em>Accidental Saints: Finding God in All the Wrong People</em></a> by Lutheran pastor <a href="http://www.nadiabolzweber.com/">Nadia Bolz-Weber</a> was just the ticket.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more of Nadia at her best, telling stories about her little parish in Denver and how she has experienced God at work in her life.</p>
<p>Nadia is a polarizing figure. Sure, you may have concerns about her attitude, language, and bits of her theology. Regardless, every time I hear or read her, I come away wishing that my faith, embrace of the Gospel, and walk with Jesus looked a little more like hers. That&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t remember when this book came onto my radar, but it was already on my Amazon wishlist when my friend Daniel&rsquo;s recommendation pushed it to the top of that list.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/1ULofwD"><em>Saved From Sacrifice: A Theology of the Cross</em></a> by S. Mark Heim is a long-ish volume that rather thoroughly summarizes the arguments for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating#The_.22scapegoat_mechanism.22_in_philosophical_anthropology">&lsquo;scapegoat&rsquo; theory of the atonement</a> as proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard">René Girard</a>. My knowledge of atonement theories has been relatively limited up to this point; aside from knowing &ldquo;penal substitionary atonement&rdquo; (PSA) (and remembering a Desiring God pastor&rsquo;s conference where Mark Driscoll declared it one of the fundamental truths of the faith that was a hill to die on), I&rsquo;ve not dug into any. So <em>Saved by Sacrifice</em> was an eye-opening entry into a differing view of Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, here&rsquo;s my summary of the condensed Wikipedia summary of Girard&rsquo;s position:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is humankind, not God, who has need for various forms of atoning violence. Humans are driven by desire for that which another has or wants. This desire increases to a point where society is at risk; it is at this point that the scapegoat mechanism is triggered. This is the point where one person is singled out as the cause of the trouble and is expelled or killed by the group. This person is the scapegoat. Social order is restored as people are contented that they have solved the cause of their problems by removing the scapegoated individual, and the cycle begins again. The keyword here is &ldquo;content&rdquo;. Scapegoating serves as a psychological relief for a group of people. Girard contends that this is what happened in the narrative of Jesus. The difference between the scapegoating of Jesus and others, Girard believes, is that in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, he is shown to be an innocent victim; humanity is thus made aware of its violent tendencies and the cycle is broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I also <a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2016/01/31/by-resurrection-jesus-is-cleared-of-the-scapegoat-charges-against-him/">quoted a paragraph from Heim&rsquo;s book in a previous blog post</a> that was a key bit of explanation in helping me get my head around the idea.</em></p>
<p>Heim spends a good chunk at the beginning of the book explaining the theory and how representations of Jesus' death from the very early church might support this scapegoat perspective. He then overviews how the scapegoat theory fits into readings of other books - including a really interesting perspective on Job - and then ties things up by addressing the key PSA texts (think Romans 3 - 5 and most of Hebrews) and how they might be read from a scapegoating perspective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this one as worthwhile reading if the topic is of interest. It was thick, but not dense - a very helpful read.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>By resurrection Jesus is cleared of the scapegoat charges against him. But the resurrection also acquits those who scapegoated him. While they certainly committed the crime and are certainly guilty, it is also incontestable that the one they are charged with killing is alive. They can be declared not guilty of Jesus' death by the fact that Jesus is not dead. The prosecution cannot proceed in this capital case without a dead body, and the tomb is empty. What the resurrection presents in court is a living person, what [Markus] Barth calls &ldquo;the evidence of the raised victim.&rdquo; It is thus righteous of God to account the accused not guilty, or justified by resurrection. Of course, the risen Christ could justly press for retribution against those who had wronged him, even if they did not succeed in silencing him permanently. But this, which is his right, is also his right to decline. And Christ does so, becoming instead an advocate for sinners.</p>

			 <p>I really appreciated <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ponderanew/2016/01/25/3-weak-arguments-against-contemporary-worship-music/">this piece from Jonathan Aigner on Ponder Anew</a> yesterday, wherein he suggests reframing so many of the discussions we have around music in the church.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deapeajay/2036243915" title="Chris Tomlin in Johnson City"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d115a773ac.jpg" alt="Chris Tomlin in Johnson City"></a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bad Argument #1: Old songs are better.</strong> This argument usually descends into warm, fuzzy reminiscences of singing in church with Grandma. That’s all fine and good, but it’s not enough&hellip; Some beloved old hymns feature terrible, vapid poetry paired with disjunct, noodly tunes, yet continue to find acceptance because their emotional appeal is so strong. Reframing this discussion: -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) keeps us grounded in the history of our faith and connects us to those who have come before, reminding us that we’re not alone. -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) protecting us from the sins of narcissism and chronological snobbery. -Singing old songs (in addition to new ones) expands our worship vocabulary, and steeps us in the language of our faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a beneficial approach; rather than focusing on arguments of preference we can discuss more significant issues that lie below the surface.</p>
<p>Aigner addresses these questions, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bad Argument #2: The band is too loud.</strong> <strong>Bad Argument #3: I don’t like it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ponderanew/2016/01/25/3-weak-arguments-against-contemporary-worship-music/">the whole thing</a>.</p>

			 <p>From a Facebook group post today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name a specific musical artist, for whatever reason, that is always able to draw a visceral emotional response from you. And if you&rsquo;re comfortable, share the reason why!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than respond just on that Facebook group, I thought I&rsquo;d post here, both because a few more people would read it, and because it&rsquo;s just the sort of music nerd thing that I will want to answer with my own spin. In this particular case I&rsquo;m going to give at least three answers, just because I can.</p>
<p>First I&rsquo;m going to go back to high school and pick the first piece of classical music I really fell head-over-heels in love with: Rachmaninov&rsquo;s Second Piano Concerto. It really clicked in order for me - first the lovely first movement (especially the slow theme in Eb major), then the slow middle movement, then the big theme of the third movement which is first introduced as a slow piano solo in Bb major, and is then driven home as the big finale. Such fantastic stuff. Grabs me every time. I bought a score of the concerto and learned all the easy piano parts, but never managed to work up all the fast nasty parts.</p>
<p>I have several recordings of Rach 2, but my favorite is one I just came upon a few years ago: Stephen Hough with the Andrew Litton and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Hough plays it fast and rowdy. I think Sergei himself might approve. Here&rsquo;s a couple minutes of a live recording that gives you an idea of the quick tempo:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pftWIQIDOi4">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>If I move on to my adult years, there are a few artists whose music has resonated with me like no other.</p>
<p>My nostalgia pick is Rich Mullins; I became a fan in high school, played and sang his music repeatedly, spent a couple days in shock when he died, and continue to count him as a huge influence on my own musical instincts. The song of his that gets a reaction now is one that I didn&rsquo;t necessarily love as much as a kid, but that resonates hugely now as an adult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My folks, they were always the first family to arrive with seven people jammed into a car that seated five there was one bathroom to bathe and shave in six of us stood in line Hot water for only three, but we all did just fine Talk about your miracles, talk about your faith My dad, he could make things grow out of Indiana clay Mom could make a gourmet meal out of just cornbread and beans And they learned to give faith hands and feet And somehow gave it wings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My dad was a piano tuner from Nebraska, not a farmer from Indiana, but outside of that&hellip; this is pretty easily the story of my family. I almost never get through it with dry eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5dRf5LO5IA">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Later on I&rsquo;d point to the music of Andrew Osenga (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DFs5ra6y2U">&ldquo;Early in the Morning&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPgb-e5RtE8">&ldquo;Swing Wide the Glimmering Gates&rdquo;</a>) and Andrew Peterson (whose <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em> is, in my book, one of the few perfect Christian albums ever).</p>
<p>The first song that comes to mind from lately, though, is &ldquo;Wait for It&rdquo; from <em>Hamilton</em>. (Yeah, I&rsquo;m talking about Hamilton again. Deal with it.)</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/01/roundtable-interview-with-the-cast-of-hamilton.html">a recent interview with the Hamilton cast</a>, Leslie Odom Jr. (who plays Aaron Burr) as his favorite - the moment of tension and focus in the production that ropes the audience in. It&rsquo;s tough to perform, but when it&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s amazing. It&rsquo;s a beautiful song, and the lyrics of the chorus elicit a response from me every time. In it, Aaron Burr reflects on the challenges and losses in his own life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life doesn&rsquo;t discriminate Between the sinners and the saints It takes, and it takes, and it takes And we keep living anyway We rise, and we fall, and we break, And we make our mistakes And if there&rsquo;s a reason I&rsquo;m still alive When so many around me have died I&rsquo;m willing to wait for it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a desperation and intensity to Burr&rsquo;s cry in this song that grabs me hard - the desire for real meaning, the joy and the pain of life&hellip; man oh man.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReTP6x">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReTP6x</a>_sDiM</p>
<p>So there you go, songs that provoke a visceral reaction from me. Do you have any of your own?</p>

<p><em>The Type B Manager</em> was an exemplary specimen of this sort of thin platitude. Even in  trying to address Type B personalities, the book tends to describe the management challenge, what a Type A manager would do, and then how a Type B manager might handle it differently - a strategy that made the Type B personality seem like the poorer option. </p>
<p>Maybe I just need to give up management books in general and spend more time reading <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com">Rands</a> instead.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t get as much read on this business trip as I&rsquo;d thought I might - French schedules have you eating dinner late with little time left for recreational reading before bed - but I did manage to finish <a href="http://amzn.to/1J4WvlO"><em>All the Light We Cannot See</em></a> by Anthony Doerr. This novel, set in WWII, tells the parallel stories of a blind French girl and a German boy with a precocious engineering streak.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautifully told story, capturing a smaller slice of life than you often get from a World War II novel. The intersections between the two main characters become clear by about half-way through the book, and I spent the rest of the time hoping against hope that the ending would be satisfactory. It was.</p>
<p><em>All the Light We Cannot See</em> won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and while I haven&rsquo;t read that much 2014/2015 fiction yet, I can understand why this one took the prize. Highly recommended.</p>

			 <p>This post serves simply as a reminder to myself that when a European immigration officer asks where I came from and then asks &ldquo;by?&rdquo; he doesn&rsquo;t want to know what Iowa is near to - he wants to know what cities my flight connected through.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;ll get rather irritated if I don&rsquo;t pick up on that quickly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he can say &ldquo;By? By? By?&rdquo; with a little more rhythm, he might have a future on an &lsquo;N Sync reunion tour.</p>

			 <p>Midwestern pastor (and Wheaton alum) April Fiet has <a href="http://aprilfiet.com/my-thoughts/wheaton-college-fear-machine">some really good thoughts today</a> about <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/january/wheaton-college-terminate-tenured-larycia-hawkins-same-god.html">the Wheaton College brouhaha</a> around professor Larycia Hawkins' comments about Muslims and Christians worshiping the &ldquo;same God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fiet doesn&rsquo;t tackle the comments themselves, but rather our approach to them, regardless of our position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What troubles me the most deeply about what is happening at Wheaton has very little to do with statements of faith, and more to do with a hermeneutic of suspicion. More narrowly, I am troubled by the fear that seems to be driving much of the conversation. It seems to me that too many conversations within the church are being powered by fear rather than by love for one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She talks about some of the fears she sees, and some of the really good things she has seen happen when fear was not so prevalent. And I really like this reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear cannot be the motivating factor for the way Christians live, move, and exist in this world. When writing about the Christian life, the author of Hebrews put it this way: “Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.” (Hebrews 12:1-2a) We run as people motivated by the cloud of witnesses all around us, and we run with our eyes on Jesus. We are not running because we’re afraid. We are not running because there’s something scary chasing us. We’re running as part of a group that has all eyes fixed on Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really appreciate her focus here. It dovetails nicely, too, with something one of my pastors has been saying recently on this topic, which is that even if we disagree with Professor Hawkins' position, we can make good progress in not &ldquo;othering&rdquo; our Muslim neighbors simply by remembering and adhering to God&rsquo;s command to love our neighbor.</p>
<p>Anyhow, <a href="http://aprilfiet.com/my-thoughts/wheaton-college-fear-machine">Fiet&rsquo;s piece: recommended reading</a>.</p>

			 <p>I picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_(film_critic)">David Thomson&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://amzn.to/1ORDCVH"><em>How to Watch a Movie</em></a> on a whim from my local library shelf knowing nothing about it or Thomson. You can&rsquo;t really call me a movie buff - I just don&rsquo;t have time to watch many movies - but I really enjoy watching them when I get the chance, and I love listening to smart people talk about movies. (The <a href="http://filmspotting.net">Filmspotting podcast</a> has been at the top of my must-listen list for at least the past 5 years.)</p>
<p>So for my interest in movies, I haven&rsquo;t (to my recollection) read any books about them.</p>
<p>And, (spoiler alert?) if you&rsquo;re in my shoes, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this one.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s brilliant and I just need to read 10 other books to get ready for it, but I don&rsquo;t think so. In 200 pages Thomson talks about different aspects of film-making and film-watching and manages to come across as a pompous snob. I pushed on through because it was short and I wasn&rsquo;t ready to start my &ldquo;nope&rdquo; list on Goodreads quite yet.</p>
<p>So, I need to find some better books on film. Which jogs my memory - the Filmspotting guys did an episode recently where they listed their top 5 film books. Guess I should&rsquo;ve paid more attention. Maybe I&rsquo;ll give it another listen.</p>

			 <p>Jake Meador over at Mere O has <a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/on-intervarsity-and-black-lives-matter/">a really good piece today</a> on the white evangelical response to the messages at Urbana last month, and more generally to the Black Lives Matter movement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have to endorse everything about the organization Black Lives Matter. We shouldn’t feel like we cannot ask questions—even critical questions—about speeches like the one given by Michelle. But we also should not be instinctively suspicious of the claims of our black neighbors. Our nation’s history is such that we should have <em>no</em> difficulty believing our black neighbors when they tell us about what life is like for black people in America today. Indeed, given our nation’s appalling history it would be more surprising if they <em>didn’t</em> have any problems.</p>

			 <p>I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this one prior to listening to an <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/">Incomparable</a> podcast episode last year - for the life of me I can&rsquo;t figure out which one - but it stocked my Amazon wish list with several tech history books, which my mother-in-law then generously gave me for Christmas.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://amzn.to/1ZNChAY">Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</a>, Levy tells the story of software hackers who for the most part aren&rsquo;t household names. Sure, there are quick mentions of Jobs, Wozniak, and Gates, but there are a dozen others you&rsquo;ve never heard of who are similarly fascinating.</p>
<p>Levy talks quite a bit about the hacker ethos and principles that were pervasive from the early 1960s until, well, business and money got significantly involved in the late 1970s. It was a fun read for me since I recognize my own potential to become one of these heads-down, computer-obsessed hackers who barely notices when the sun rises or sets. (A course I have thankfully avoided thus far&hellip; for which my wife is both thankful and probably largely responsible.)</p>
<p><em>Yes, I&rsquo;m shamelessly picking up <a href="http://johnthelutheran.tumblr.com/tagged/reading">John Halton&rsquo;s habit of blogging reading progress</a> this year, if for no other reason than it gives me 60+ additional posts a year&hellip; and maybe give a reader a good recommendation for a book to read.

			 <p>So here&rsquo;s an idea: a sci-fi novel written by somebody who can actually write, with the physics and science worked out by a real nerd sidekick. That&rsquo;s what you get from <em>[Saturn Run](Saturn Run <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399176950/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_DzGHwbJ7YSH4D)">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399176950/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_DzGHwbJ7YSH4D)</a></em> by novelist John Sanford with help from sci-if nerd Ctein.   <em>Saturn Run</em> is the book <em>The Martian</em> wishes it could be if Andy Weir had a talent for prose.

			 <p>For the past hour or so on this Christmas Eve morning we&rsquo;ve been listening to the Nine Lessons and Carols service live on the BBC from Kings College Chapel in Cambridge. Beautiful stuff as you would expect - lovely choir, big organ, lots of scripture readings.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional carols, though, there was a new carol, commissioned for this service. The text is from poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Szirtes">George Szirtes</a>, with music by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Causton_%28composer%29">Richard Causton</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>The child on the dirt path finds the highway blocked The dogs at the entrance snarl that doors are locked The great god of kindness has his kindness mocked <em>May those who travel light</em> <em>Find shelter on the flight</em> <em>May Bethlehem</em> <em>Give rest to them.</em> The sea is a graveyard the beach is dry bones the child at the station is pelted with stones the cop stands impassive the ambulance drones We sleep then awaken we rest on the way our sleep might be troubled but hope is our day we move on for ever like children astray We move on for ever our feet leave no mark you won’t hear our voices once we’re in the dark but here is our fire this child is our spark.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had a record catch my attention and get stuck in my head like <a href="http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com/">Hamilton</a> has over the past couple of weeks. If you follow me on Twitter or Facebook you&rsquo;re already probably tired of hearing about it. But in the spirit of it&rsquo;s-still-stuck-in-my-head-and-I-want-to-talk-about-it, I&rsquo;m writing a blog post in the hopes of reaching a few folks who wouldn&rsquo;t likely otherwise familiarize themselves with it.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the summary of this new Broadway musical sounds, frankly, bizarre: a rap/hip-hop musical, featuring nearly all non-white actors, about the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To Hamilton&rsquo;s writer/composer, though, it makes perfect sense. Lin-Manuel Miranda, a thirty-something New Yorker and son of Puerto Rican immigrants, sees Hamilton&rsquo;s story as a classic immigrant story. Born in the Caribbean, no father around, mother died when he was young. Immigrated to America, and with great ambition and drive played a significant hand in the founding of the USA, only to die in a duel at the hand of Vice President and long-time rival Aaron Burr. So why <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> you tell this story?</p>
<p>Miranda gave an early performance of what would become the opening song of the musical at a White House evening of poetry, music, and spoken word back in 2009. (He was invited after penning his first musical, the Tony Award-winning <em>In The Heights</em>.) You can see the range of reactions in this video: at first, everybody chuckles at the idea of a hip-hop album about Alexander Hamilton. But 4 minutes in, he&rsquo;s <em>really good</em>, and they&rsquo;re hooked.</p>

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WNFf7nMIGnE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>After hearing friends rave about Hamilton for a few days I went ahead and bought the cast recording. It&rsquo;s clear at once that Hamilton is serious story telling. It&rsquo;s not played for laughs or trying to highlight the incongruity of a Hispanic man in the lead and African Americans playing Burr, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington. After 10 minutes you&rsquo;ll buy into the idea, and by the end of the musical you&rsquo;ll have a new perspective on immigrants shaping our country in its infancy.</p>
<p>What grabbed me first about Hamilton was the lyrics. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of smart wordplay, whether it be in silly family pun battles, Mel Brooks lyrics, Andrew Peterson songs, or Danny Kaye movies. And in Hamilton they&rsquo;re smart, and they&rsquo;re <em>incessant</em>. In the Alexander Hamilton character&rsquo;s introductory song &ldquo;My Shot&rdquo;, he raps without hardly taking a breath, about his plight as a new immigrant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m ‘a get a scholarship to King’s College. I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish. The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish. I gotta holler just to be heard. With every word, I drop knowledge! I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal tryin’ to reach my goal. My power of speech:unimpeachable. Only nineteen but my mind is older. These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder ev’ry burden, ev’ry disadvantage I have learned to manage, I don’t have a gun to brandish, I walk these streets famished.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The musical traces Hamilton&rsquo;s life through his move to America, his marriage to Eliza Schuyler, his involvement in the revolution and the founding of the country, his writing of many of the Federalist Papers, the affair that most likely cost him a shot at the presidency, the untimely death of his son, and his final showdown with Burr.</p>
<p>This bit from CBS Sunday Morning back in March is a nice brief overview of Hamilton the man, Hamilton the show, and the magnetic and clearly brilliant Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re mildly interested by this point, I&rsquo;d recommend checking out the cast album. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLUSRfoOcUe4avCXPg6tPgdZzu--hBXUYx&amp;v=Zp9HUc9HraQ">It&rsquo;s up on YouTube to stream</a> if you&rsquo;re not ready to commit to a purchase.) It&rsquo;s possible it won&rsquo;t be your thing - Hamilton is currently sold out for goodness knows how long at the Richard Rodgers Theater on Broadway, but your standard Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical it ain&rsquo;t - but if you can immerse yourself in it for an hour or two I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll regret it.</p>
<p>As a footnote: my friend Bethany pointed me toward the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ParksandHam&amp;src=tyah">#ParksAndHam</a> mashup on Twitter, wherein folks are combining Hamilton quotes with pictures from Parks and Recreation. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Parks and Rec, there are some pretty great ones out there.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Self-described post-evangelical (and Methodist worship pastor) Jonathan Aigner wrote on Patheos recently on <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/ponderanew/2015/10/19/8-reasons-the-worship-industry-is-killing-worship/">&ldquo;8 Reasons the Worship Industry Is Killing Worship&rdquo;</a>. I both resonated and disagreed with enough of his post that I figure it&rsquo;s worth a short response.</p>
<p>Aigner&rsquo;s eight points, with my thoughts interspersed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. It’s [sic] sole purpose is to make us feel something.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aigner says that the worship industry &ldquo;<em>must</em> engage us on a purely sensory level to find widespread appeal&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with Aigner here on the overall concept and disagree with him on the breadth of his statements. Does the worship industry rely too heavily on the sensory level to get us engaged? Probably, yeah. But is it affecting us &ldquo;purely on an emotional level&rdquo;, as he claims? I won&rsquo;t go that far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. The industry hijacks worship.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When the mind is disengaged and worship is reduced to an emotional experience,&rdquo;, says Aigner, &ldquo;worship descends into narcissistic and self-referential meaninglessness.&rdquo; This point relies on your accepting his point #1, so given that I&rsquo;ve only partially granted it, I&rsquo;m on the fence here, too. When worship music completely disengages the brain and works solely on emotion, I&rsquo;d agree that it becomes fairly meaningless. But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s happening quite as broadly as he asserts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>3. It says that music IS worship.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re finding common ground. In our current evangelical mindset, &ldquo;worship&rdquo; is too often just the music part of the service, to be joined up with &ldquo;announcements&rdquo;, &ldquo;preaching&rdquo;, etc. Our thoughtful members would probably nuance the definition if asked, but it&rsquo;s very easy for anyone, including myself, when leading worship music in the service (see how I just slipped into it there?), to lazily allow just the music to be referred to as &ldquo;worship&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4. It’s a derivative of mainstream commercial music.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes&hellip; but.</p>
<p>As my wife can attest, I have gone off on many a rant about how Christian music so obviously follows mainstream music, just 5 years behind.</p>
<p>Say, for example, when I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX5139rmgGw">Chris Tomlin&rsquo;s video of his song &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Great Dance Floor&rdquo;</a> (a concept that I don&rsquo;t even really want to explore from a theological standpoint, but that&rsquo;s beside the point), where he matches <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRP72Ib2e9I">Coldplay&rsquo;s Chris Martin</a> in musical style, jacket, and even awkward white-guy dancing.</p>
<p>Or when I realized circa 2012 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbB0QrBIs9k">DC*Talk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jesus Freak&rdquo;</a> copied <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg">Nirvana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smells Like Teen Spirit&rdquo;</a> down to the same chord sequence for the intro. (Points to the late Kurt Cobain for at least not adding a rap about a belly jiggling and &lsquo;a typical tattoo green&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>But on the other hand&hellip; all music is derivative. Commercial music just like church music. For every truly groundbreaking artist you will find a dozen knock-offs popping up a few years later. History has a way of preserving the good ones and weeding out the bad ones. So while some music is <em>so</em> derivative of better mainstream versions that you just have to avoid it, being derivative, by itself, isn&rsquo;t killing us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5. It perpetuates an awkward contemporary Christian media subculture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[Christian worship music] can&rsquo;t possibly find itself in <a href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/2/25/leonard_bernstein_di.html">Bernstein&rsquo;s five percent</a> because it&rsquo;s too busy talking about how &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; it is, instead of telling the story.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll preach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>6. It spreads bad theology.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sympathetic here, too, but this is <strong>not</strong> a factor unique to modern church music. Again, history has a way of weeding out the really atrocious stuff, but you will find theological nightmares in classic hymnody, and you will find beautiful pieces of good theology in modern songs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7. It creates worship superstars</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aigner clarifies that he&rsquo;s really complaining about the rock star persona many worship artists take on and the fandom that grows from it. And he&rsquo;s got a decent point. &ldquo;We the church become an audience. Groupies. Screaming teenagers for Jesus.&rdquo; Yep.</p>
<p>That being said, when I hear &ldquo;worship superstars&rdquo;, my first thoughts run along the lines of Charles Wesley, Fanny Crosby, Isaac Watts, J.S. Bach&hellip; We all have our superstars. The modern ones just have to deal with the modern trappings of celebrity that go along with fandom in this culture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>8. It’s made music into a substitute Eucharist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I think Aigner has a point that&rsquo;s well worth considering - not necessarily as much for how it critiques our value of the music as it does our value of the Eucharist. I&rsquo;ll quote him at length:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most evangelicals, along with the mainline Protestants who are looking to commercial Christian music as an institutional life preserver, use music as if it were a sacrament. Through their music, they allow themselves to be carried away on an emotional level into a perceived sensory connection with the divine. Music is their bread and wine. Don’t believe me? Try telling your church, your pastor even, that we should make a switch. Let’s have Communion ever week, and music once a month (or where I come from, once a quarter). It probably won’t go over well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That point hits home in my third-Sunday-of-odd-numbered-months-practicing church.</p>
<p>Overall, I appreciate Aigner and people in his camp pushing us toward theological excellence, away from the celebrity worship culture, and toward the Eucharist. On the whole, though, his discussion points might still need some work.</p>

<p>&hellip;it struck me how emotionally reactive we are to social media, our feelings getting jerked around by the latest thing that breaks on Twitter or Facebook. Sometimes it is happiness and euphoria. <em>Yay, our side is winning!</em> Sometimes it is despondency and despair. <em>Oh no, the other side is winning!</em> &hellip; So let&rsquo;s remember the wisdom of Thérèse of Lisieux.

			 <p>A proclamation of the Gospel that I love and seems timely:</p>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>joy of the gospel</strong> fills the hearts and lives of all who encounter Jesus. Those who accept his offer of salvation are set free from sin, sorrow, inner emptiness and loneliness. With Christ joy is constantly born anew&hellip;</p>
<p>The great danger in today’s world, pervaded as it is by consumerism, is the desolation and anguish born of a complacent yet covetous heart, the feverish pursuit of frivolous pleasures, and a blunted conscience. [&hellip;] God’s voice is no longer heard, the quiet joy of his love is no longer felt, and the desire to do good fades. This is a very real danger for believers too. Many fall prey to it, and end up resentful, angry and listless. <strong>That is no way to live a dignified and fulfilled life; it is not God’s will for us, nor is it the life in the Spirit which has its source in the heart of the risen Christ.</strong></p>
<p>I invite all Christians, everywhere, at this very moment, to <strong>a renewed personal encounter with Jesus Christ, or at least an openness to letting him encounter them</strong>; I ask all of you to do this unfailingly each day. No one should think that this invitation is not meant for him or her, since “no one is excluded from the joy brought by the Lord”. The Lord does not disappoint those who take this risk; whenever we take a step towards Jesus, we come to realize that he is already there, waiting for us with open arms. Now is the time to say to Jesus: “Lord, I have let myself be deceived; in a thousand ways I have shunned your love, yet here I am once more, to renew my covenant with you. I need you. Save me once again, Lord, take me once more into your redeeming embrace”. How good it feels to come back to him whenever we are lost! <strong>Let me say this once more: God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy</strong>&hellip;.</p>
<p>The Gospel, radiant with the glory of Christ’s cross, constantly invites us to rejoice&hellip; Why should we not also enter into this great stream of joy?</p>
<p>There are Christians whose lives seem like Lent without Easter. I realize of course that joy is not expressed the same way at all times in life, especially at moments of great difficulty. <strong>Joy adapts and changes, but it always endures, even as a flicker of light born of our personal certainty that, when everything is said and done, we are infinitely loved.</strong> I understand the grief of people who have to endure great suffering, yet slowly but surely we all have to let the joy of faith slowly revive as a quiet yet firm trust, even amid the greatest distress: “My soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is… But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness… It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord” (Lam 3:17, 21-23, 26).</p>
<p>I never tire of repeating those words &hellip; which take us to the very heart of the Gospel: <strong>“Being a Christian is not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea, but the encounter with an event, a person, which gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction”</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks solely to this encounter – or renewed encounter – with God’s love, which blossoms into an enriching friendship, we are liberated from our narrowness and self-absorption. <strong>We become fully human</strong> when we become more than human, when we let God bring us beyond ourselves in order to attain the fullest truth of our being. Here we find the source and inspiration of all our efforts at evangelization. <strong>For if we have received the love which restores meaning to our lives, how can we fail to share that love with others?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>That&rsquo;ll preach.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a beautiful bit in the <a href="http://onbeing.org/program/john-o-donohue-the-inner-landscape-beauty/203">On Being episode</a> that was published earlier this week, from a 2008 interview that host Krista Tippett held with the late Irish poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O%27Donohue">John O&rsquo;Donohue</a>.</p>
<p>This quote reminds me of a lot of what NT Wright says about the spiritual dimension and about churches being beachheads where God&rsquo;s kingdom overlaps and is shining into the world. Here&rsquo;s what O&rsquo;Donohue said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this, the way we make divisions all the time between the visible world and the invisible world, and it&rsquo;s as if the invisible world is the poor relation and the visible world is ultimate ground and reality, and the more I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this the more it seems to me actually that the visible world is the first shoreline of the invisible world. And the same way, I believe, with the body and the soul - that actually the body is in the soul, not the soul just in the body - and that in some way the poignance of being a human being is that you are the place where the invisible becomes visible and expressive in some way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some ways it feels like it was just yesterday&hellip; until I start thinking about all the intervening events. 17 years later we&rsquo;ve added three kids, cycled through about half a dozen cats, have a lot less hair, and still play church softball every season.

<blockquote>
<p>What a lot of people get and that some people don&rsquo;t get is that you&rsquo;re not trying to be difficult, but that the more you enjoy something the more you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how it could be better. And here&rsquo;s a thing that&rsquo;s actually not such a big deal that you could make better. It&rsquo;s not an insult, it&rsquo;s not a slam. And for me, whenever people say &ldquo;oh you gotta to out and set goals for yourself&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;well, maybe&rdquo;. You know goals can really be self-defeating if they aren&rsquo;t updated and realistic. &ldquo;Oh you should never have goals.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s not true. Do you really wanna play tennis without a net? I feel like maybe I&rsquo;m more of a contrarian? I feel like, whenever somebody comes up with something that&rsquo;s, like, an unvulnerable pronouncement about how the world mostly always is, it gets my dander up a little bit, and I don&rsquo;t feel like I <em>have</em> to say something, but I know I&rsquo;m thinking that person&rsquo;s probably a little bit of a bozo.</p>

<p>Preach, brother Merlin. Preach.</p>

			 <p>As a worship leader I confess I grumble from time to time about the current propensity of our songwriters to appropriate and revise classic hymns in ways that just drive me crazy.</p>
<p>For example, my worship pastor has heard me rant on more than one occasion about Chris Tomlin&rsquo;s modification of the last verse of <em>Crown Him With Many Crowns</em>. The original lines directly address Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Redeemer, hail, for Thou hast died for me, Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Tomlin, for some reason that doesn&rsquo;t entail the rhyming scheme, revises the words to talk <em>about</em> Jesus rather than <em>to</em> Him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Redeemer, hail, for He has died for me, His praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why, Chris, why? You could&rsquo;ve modernized the language without screwing around with the perspective of the song. Argh.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and don&rsquo;t even get me started about the multiple Christian-ese re-writes of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;. Yikes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;World Famous Christmas Songs, containing the best and most popular Songs of the Nativity&rdquo;. Compiled and Edited by the Reverend George Rittenhouse. Published in 1929, it&rsquo;s an eclectic assortment of both secular and sacred songs.</p>
<p>What stuck out to me as I paged through was that when it says &ldquo;edited&rdquo; by Rev. Rittenhouse, they weren&rsquo;t kidding. His fingerprints are all over this thing.</p>
<p>For instance, he rather ambitiously chooses to re-harmonize <em>Angels We Have Heard on High</em> with some extra movement:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another place he appropriates Bizet&rsquo;s <em>L&rsquo;Arlessienne</em> and some old lyrics to create a rather bombastic tune subtitled &ldquo;The March of the Kings&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then there&rsquo;s this gem, wherein he re-writes the lyrics of &ldquo;O Tannenbaum!&rdquo; to give them a Christian angle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Christmas Tree! Fair Christmas Tree! A type of Life Eternal! O Christmas Tree! Fair Christmas Tree! Your boughs are ever vernal. So fresh and green in Summer heat, and bright when snows lie round your feet O Christmas Tree! Fair Christmas Tree! A type of Life Eternal!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A classic waiting to happen, right there. There are two more verses if you&rsquo;re really interested.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="the-more-things-change">The more things change&hellip;</h3>
<p>I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that these impulses have been around a long time. (Picture a musician in the court of King Hezekiah - &ldquo;gah, why can&rsquo;t we just sing that psalm the way King David wrote it?&quot;) But it was comforting to see that confirmation, and to be reminded that history has a way of weeding out the material of lesser quality and holding on to the good stuff.</p>
<p>I guess I can be patient.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had the sacraments (especially the Eucharist) on my mind lately after reading James K. A. Smith&rsquo;s <em>Desiring the Kingdom</em>, and then listening to the <a href="http://onbeing.org/program/father-greg-boyle-on-the-calling-of-delight/5053">On Being podcast</a> this morning I found this bit from Father Greg Boyle, a delightful Jesuit priest who has spent his life working with gang members in Los Angeles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus doesn&rsquo;t lose any sleep that we will forget that the Eucharist is sacred; He is anxious that we might forget that it&rsquo;s ordinary, that it&rsquo;s a meal shared among friends, because if we don&rsquo;t see that, then we&rsquo;ll be unable to recognize the sacred in the ordinary, and <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> the incarnation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting to hear from a Catholic. But in my experience, this is a trap we Evangelicals have fallen into at various times, too.</p>

<p>What we have, uniquely in America, is a political class, and an entire political party, devoted to the idea that any money spent on public goods is money misplaced, not because the state goods might not be good but because they would distract us from the larger principle that no ultimate good can be found in the state. Ride a fast train to Washington today and you’ll start thinking about national health insurance tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My family just returned from a two-week vacation road trip that took us through Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Alabama before returning home. You notice things while driving for days.</p>
<p>While in Tennessee we stopped at a state park built around a Tennessee Valley Authority dam that was built in the 1930s as a part of the New Deal and is still going strong. (I had no idea the TVA system of electrical generating dams was as big as it is.)</p>
<p><a href="http://chrishubbs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IMG_4406.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wordpress/wp-content/551/2015/05/IMG_4406-500x375.jpg" alt="Norris Dam"></a> <em>[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris_Dam">Norris Dam</a>, commissioned in 1936.]</em></p>
<p>The only way our road trip was possible was thanks to the massive Interstate Highway system kicked off in the 1950s. So beneficial to be able to drive between major cities at fast speeds without having to slow down for each town. But many of the roads were in bad condition, with a minimum number of apparent ongoing repairs.</p>
<p>While in North Carolina we saw the news of the terrible Amtrak crash, in a Philadelphia neighborhood familiar to my mother-in-law, not far from where she used to live.</p>
<p>While in Alabama we visited the US Space and Rocket Center. We marveled at the almost indescribably huge Saturn V rocket and pored over displays detailing the US space program from the 1960s to the space shuttle and Skylab in the 80s and 90s to&hellip; well, not much today.</p>
<h3 id="so">So&hellip;?</h3>
<p>It seems obvious to me that the days of infrastructure spending are past, and that seems like an increasing problem. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to say &ldquo;the government is the problem, not the solution&rdquo; when you do your taxes and have to figure out the tax code that even the IRS doesn&rsquo;t really understand.</p>
<p>But if the government isn&rsquo;t going to maintain the roads, who is? Does anybody really think we&rsquo;d be better off without the federal Interstate Highway system, or without the TVA&rsquo;s utilities? Thousands of commuters use the train system every day, helping ease the strain (and pollution) of car commutes. Should we hope somehow that private enterprise will fund those repairs and infrastructure investments?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enlightening to spend a few minutes looking at <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/">the Federal Government spending breakdown over on the National Priorities Project</a>. Of a nearly $4 trillion federal budget, a full two-thirds of it is commitments to Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>Then here&rsquo;s how the remaining third breaks down:</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1b12165ddb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking to me how small a fraction is spent on infrastructure-type things. The entire budget for transportation, energy &amp; environment, and science is only 8% of discretionary spending. We spend seven times as much on the military as we do for highways, airways, power, environmental protection, and space combined.</p>
<p>This is not workable for the United States in the long term. Regardless of our party affiliation, we should recognize that the government is at its best when it is pooling resources for the common good. And from my vantage point in the driver&rsquo;s seat of a minivan these past couple weeks, there&rsquo;s a lot of good that needs to be done if we could just agree to make it a priority to do it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m working my way through Jamie Smith&rsquo;s <em>Desiring the Kingdom</em>, and he is driving home the point that it&rsquo;s not just our minds that need formed, but our hearts. He argues that humans are not, at a base level, <em>thinkers</em>, but <em>lovers</em>. As such, Christians need to be concerned not just with education, but with formation of our practices and desires. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have more thoughts later, but this quote stuck out today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the church often adopts a &hellip; misguided strategy: while the mall, Victoria&rsquo;s Secret, and Jerry Bruckheimer are grabbing hold of our gut (<em>kardia</em>) by means of our body and its senses - in stories and images, sights and sound, and commercial versions of &ldquo;smells and bells&rdquo; - the church&rsquo;s response is oddly rationalist.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It plunks us down in a &ldquo;worship&rdquo; service, the culmination of which is a forty-five-minute didactic sermon, a sort of holy lecture, trying to <em>convince</em> us of the dangers by implanting doctrines and beliefs in our minds.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
While the mall paradoxically appreciates that we are liturgical, desiring animals, the (Protestant) church still tends to see us as Cartesian minds. While secular liturgies are after our hearts through our bodies, the church thinks it only has to get into our heads. While Victoria&rsquo;s Secret is fanning a flame in our <em>kardia</em>, the church is trucking water to our minds. While secular liturgies are enticing us with affective images of a good life, the church is trying to convince us otherwise by depositing ideas.</p>

			 <p>In a recent update of Christianity Today&rsquo;s <em>Leadership Journal</em> they <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/parse/2015/april/truth-for-new-generation.html">interviewed Josh McDowell about, among other things, current trends on the belief in the inerrancy of the Bible</a>. Here&rsquo;s how the first bit went:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Trust in the inerrancy of Scripture, even among some evangelicals, has waned in recent years. Why do you think this is? There is no one reason. <strong>I think one of the major reasons is the information glut on the Internet.</strong> The Internet is so gigantic. <strong>It has leveled the playing field.</strong> Atheists and agnostics have such ready access to our kids. It didn’t use to be this way. Now, information—good and bad—is just one click away. <strong>Pastors, youth pastors, professors, and others are being confronted with deep theological, philosophical, and historical challenges to the Scriptures that no one would even hear about until their fourth year at a university.</strong> Believers are being confronted with so many opposing positions on the Scriptures—issues the majority from past generations simply didn’t confront. This has tended to undermine people’s belief system. That is why we need to redouble our efforts to communicate biblical truth.</p>

<p>I think McDowell&rsquo;s point is valid, but I&rsquo;m a little disturbed about what it seems to imply. If I were to boil the Q&amp;A down, the reasoning might go like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Trust in the inerrancy of Scripture&rdquo; is waning. This is bad.</li>
<li>This is happening in large part because Christians have more information than they used to have.</li>
<li>If Christians having this information causes a bad result&hellip; maybe Christians shouldn&rsquo;t have this information?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, McDowell doesn&rsquo;t go fully there - he says that we just need to try even harder to communicate biblical truth - but I get wary any time I hear an argument that says the problem was caused by people knowing too much.</p>
<p>If you have an argument that you&rsquo;re fully confident is true, shouldn&rsquo;t you welcome the fact that people want to understand more about the Scripture, where it came from, how God uses it, and so on? If there are &ldquo;deep theological, philosophical, and historical challenges to the Scriptures&rdquo;, shouldn&rsquo;t Evangelical leaders be addressing them head-on rather than decrying their broader availability?</p>
<h4 id="am-i-overreacting-here">Am I overreacting here?</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit put off by the phrase &ldquo;trust in the inerrancy of the Scripture&rdquo;. Of all the things Christians are called to trust in, that&rsquo;s not one of them.</p>
<p>It seems likely to me that Evangelical leaders have often briskly asserted &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; as a linchpin for maintaining beliefs about other things (young-earth creationism, homosexuality, complementarianism, etc, etc) either without fully teasing out the difficult nuances of what &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; means, or (more likely) without dealing with the reality that many preachers will teach on &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; without any appreciation for those nuances.</p>
<p>Generations of Christians before may have gone through life without ever really stopping to think about what &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; meant, but as the internet broadens our social and intellectual horizons, the right response isn&rsquo;t to decry that broadening, but to teach with more detail and nuance what we mean by the word.</p>
<p><em>For those of you still reading this post who are getting concerned about me putting the word &ldquo;inerrancy&rdquo; in quotes: I believe that the Bible is God-breathed, and profitable for doctrine, correction, reproof, instruction, etc. I also agree with John Piper&rsquo;s nuance of &ldquo;without error in the original manuscripts&rdquo;, given <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/how-are-the-synoptics-without-error">his understanding of &ldquo;error&rdquo;</a> [emphasis mine]:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A writer is in error when <strong>the basic intention in his statements</strong> and admonitions, <strong>properly understood in their nearer and wider context</strong>, is not true.</p>

			 <p>Rod Dreher has been championing an idea he calls <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher-categories/benedict-option/">The Benedict Option</a> - as he describes it, &ldquo;a limited, strategic withdrawal of Christians from the mainstream of American popular culture, for the sake of shoring up our understanding of what the church is, and what we must do to be the church&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/acullador/1457824233" title="St. Benedict of Nursia by Jun Acullador, on Flickr"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/71f42d3e20.jpg" alt="St. Benedict of Nursia"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ayjay.org/uncategorized/withdrawals-and-commitments/">Alan Jacobs spins things in a slightly different direction</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I wonder if a better way to think about the Benedict Option is not as a strategic <em>withdrawal</em> from anything in particular but a strategic <em>attentiveness</em> to the institutions and forms of life within which Christians can flourish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s some interesting reading, even if Dreher can be rather dour. But I really like what <a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/brief-thought-benedict-option/">Jake Meador has to say about it today over at Mere Orthodoxy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;perhaps the issue isn’t that the culture has moved away from the faith, but that the faith’s adherents have moved away from it along with the culture–and as the culture we’ve attached ourselves to becomes progressively more antagonistic to orthodoxy we are simply becoming aware of the distance that has opened between the faithful and traditional orthodoxy. We’ve been riding along with the culture even when we shouldn’t have and we’re just now beginning to realize where that ride has taken us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there will always be some who feel called to a more significant strategic withdrawal from the culture, Meador&rsquo;s analysis seems close to the mark. Maybe withdrawing from the culture isn&rsquo;t something special for this time and era so much as it is a call out from a culture to which we&rsquo;re far too drawn in. Certainly worth some reading and thought.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I pulled into the parking lot for the concert, I immediately had a sense of foreboding. I had mostly come to see a favorite singer-songwriter, well-known in Nashville but still touring with larger acts in other parts of the country. For this concert, she was touring with an old high school favorite, and I didn’t think much of it, except that it might be fun to hear them play again. I hadn’t looked into it any further than that, and had been to plenty of church-based concerts in the years since leaving the evangelical church (for lack of better term), so I had no reason to think this one would be any different. Except that it was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Susan does an excellent job of not questioning the motives or intentions of the concert audience while still asking some pointed questions about the motivations of the performers and producers, and about how the &ldquo;worship experience&rdquo; is managed and (potentially) manipulated.</p>

<p>In yesterday&rsquo;s post I included the word &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; in a list of traits that I felt characterize what it means to be a Christ-like human being. But relaxed isn&rsquo;t a word you hear a great deal in discussions of Christian virtue and character. And yet, I think relaxation is key, a foundational issue.</p>

<p>I think he might be on to something here. So how do we relax, you ask?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus&rsquo;s answer is twofold. First, trust. Trust that God will take care for you. Consider the lilies and the birds. Second, place your heart in a location where moth and rust do not destroy or thieves break in and steal. Your heart must be &ldquo;hidden in Christ&rdquo; in a place where death has no dominion. Trouble is, these recommendations strike us as pious platitudes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. President, what if the unthinkable happens? What if the launch goes wrong, and Napoleon is not stranded on the Moon?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have Safire write up a speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the late great William Safire ever since finding his On Language columns (collected into several volumes) as a kid. The reference here is to <a href="http://gawker.com/5369364/william-safires-finest-speech">the speech that Nixon had Safire draft to be used in the event that the Apollo 11 moon landing went wrong</a>.

			 <p>Really good stuff on the Christian movie phenomenon, in the deliciously-titled <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/march-web-only/do-you-believe-in-confirmation-bias.html">“Do You Believe in Confirmation Bias?”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do remain concerned, however, that when such anecdotal evidence [e.g. of Atheist professors persecuting Christian students] is amplified and looped in and through the echo chamber, it has a detrimental effect on God’s people. It promotes a culture of fear and a culture of antagonism. It reinforces the belief that those outside our circle are our enemies, to be battled, rather than our mission field, to be loved and evangelized.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To the extent it overstates our persecution, it pushes us to prioritize standing our ground and protecting our rights over being salt and light. To the extent it fixates on archetypal stories of our victimization, it makes us quick to assume evil intent when we face conflicts and slow to acknowledge our own roles in perpetuating them.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Perhaps—perhaps—it tempts us with the lie that those times and places where we have been wronged justify ignoring our teachers’ admonitions to treat those who question our beliefs with gentleness and respect.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Maybe the more pertinent question to ask in the face of Christian movies like God’s Not Dead and Do You Believe? is not whether they are accurate representations of the world we live in, but whether the way they respond—and invite us to respond—to that broken world will help us to remake it into something healthier, holier, and more reflective of kingdom principles.</p>

			 <p>I had about five things turn up in my RSS reading today that I want to blog before long. But it&rsquo;s Friday, which merits things entertaining and lighthearted.</p>
<p>First up: a jazzy cover of Radiohead&rsquo;s classic song &ldquo;Creep&rdquo;, with American Idol singer Haley Reinhart on vocals. (They replace the F word in this version with something cleaner, so it&rsquo;s safe to turn on in front of small children.) I love how great songs manage to be viable and stay great even when transformed into a different genre. This is a good example.</p>

<p>Next up: Sesame Street reminds us again that it writes most of its humor to amuse the parents who would otherwise grow unbearably weary of its puppets. The latest example: &ldquo;Game of Chairs&rdquo;. Fans of Game of Thrones should be quite amused.</p>

			 <p>The kerfuffle around Indiana&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_SB_101">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> this week has been a mess of ugly rhetoric and heat generated without creating a lot of light on the subject. The RFRA was passed by the Indiana legislature and signed by the governor, only to elicit massive outcry from corporate leaders who immediately did reactive things like restricting business travel to Indiana.</p>
<p>Joe Carter lamented thus on Twitter this morning:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joecarter/status/583307622322970625">twitter.com/joecarter&hellip;</a></p>
<p>He was quickly retweeted by, among others, Russell Moore, who is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission for the Southern Baptist Convention.</p>
<p>The fact that American is (and has been, for some decades) functionally an oligarchy <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10769041/The-US-is-an-oligarchy-study-concludes.html">isn&rsquo;t really breaking news</a>. I find it interesting, though, that the religious wing of the GOP is suddenly this week finding it concerning.</p>
<p>More interesting is that, if you want to try to change things and eliminate that oligarchy, you&rsquo;re going to have to take steps <em>that the GOP opposes</em>. (The obvious first one that comes to mind is restricting the amount of money that corporations can dump in to influence elections.)</p>
<p>Hmmm&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Grace is a difficult pill to swallow. A dangerous doctrine. The fact that the evangelical church has bought into that thought hit me between the eyes at my men&rsquo;s bible study yesterday morning.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in Hebrews 9 at the moment, the most familiar verse of which was a frequent memory verse in AWANA and whatever other church things I was in growing up. It was always presented for memorization this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment. &ndash; Hebrews 9:27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse was frequently packaged in a set of verses designed as what we would&rsquo;ve called a Gospel presentation. Inherent message: you&rsquo;re gonna die, you don&rsquo;t know when, and after that you&rsquo;ll be judged. So, if you haven&rsquo;t asked Jesus into your heart, do it today! And if you have, repent of that sin and clean your life up so you won&rsquo;t have to fear judgment for your sins!</p>
<p>Yesterday we read the verse in context with the rest of the chapter, and here&rsquo;s what we read (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. 25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, <strong>he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself</strong>. 27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, <strong>not to deal with sin but to save</strong> those who are eagerly waiting for him. &ndash; Hebrews 9:24 - 28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a change of message! Now Christ is the one who died once for all, took the judgment, so that we, who accept that gift by grace, can wait <em>eagerly</em> for him to return and save.</p>
<p>Now <em>that&rsquo;s</em> awesome news.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2015/03/18/legalism-is-your-spiritual-illusion-by-sean-palmer/">this reminder from Sean Palmer</a> guest-posting over on Scot McKnight&rsquo;s blog today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God loves you, just as you are, not as you might be some day. Embrace that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.missioalliance.org/how-does-the-church-differ-from-america/">challenging riff from pastor Brian Zahnd over on Missio Alliance</a> today.</p>
<p>How, he asks, does the church differ from America?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The particular challenge for the American Christian is to distinguish the American way of being human from the church (the Jesus way of being human). If there is no essential difference between being Christian and being American (as a way of life), then what is the point of the church? This is a problem. Many American Christians would find it difficult to list five ways in which the Jesus way (the church) differs significantly from the American way. For them the church and the American way are essentially the same way of being human. Which in essence means this: The church does not actually exist. What exists is America. The church (and every other institution) exists only to support the supreme idea of America. Oh, boy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to list 12. How many could you list? It&rsquo;s worth considering.</p>

<p>Pastor Rick Warren&rsquo;s tweet echoes a sentiment that I&rsquo;ve been hearing a lot lately around evangelical Christianity: that ISIS is an evil that must be stopped. Unsaid but clearly implied is that the USA should be stopping ISIS by &ldquo;wielding the sword&rdquo; - in other words, send in the military.</p>
<p>On one hand, I&rsquo;m sympathetic. I&rsquo;m a red-blooded male who gets motivated by the idea of going and fighting evil, and who today appears more evil than ISIS? I&rsquo;m horrified (as nearly everyone is) by the videos of beheadings, and my heart is wrenched when I hear the accounts of children being kidnapped from families.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip; I get a little uneasy at the rhetoric I see going around, and believe that Christians should rethink that rhetoric, for at least a couple of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, there&rsquo;s a legitimate case to be made for Christian pacifism. I&rsquo;m not sure at the moment quite where I fall along the just war - pacifism spectrum, but I respect those who believe that when Jesus said &ldquo;love your enemies and do good to them that hate you&rdquo;, it has a practical implication that means you won&rsquo;t call for your enemies to be killed.</p>
<h3 id="yeah-the-pacifism-argument-doesnt-work-for-me">Yeah, the pacifism argument doesn&rsquo;t work for me.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&hellip;&rdquo; I hear some say, &ldquo;&hellip;Paul says that the government has the responsibility to wield the sword, to reward those who do good and punish those who do evil&rdquo;. True enough. But, even if you subscribe to that, I&rsquo;ve got some more thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, I have serious reservations about whether or not sending the US military back in large numbers into the middle east to fight ISIS is a solution that will actually improve things. Unless you&rsquo;ve been under a rock since 1990, you&rsquo;re most likely aware that the US has had troops on the ground in the Middle East for the past 25 years, and that they don&rsquo;t seem to have greatly stabilized the situation. It also looks a lot like ISIS is intentionally spoiling for a fight. How many more decades do we need to continue with this strategy before we start considering other approaches?</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, while &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t negotiate with evil, good people stop evil&rdquo; is great rhetoric and makes a punchy 140-character tweet, it doesn&rsquo;t hold up as a consistent axiom even in a very brief reading of 20th century history. Sure, we went in to stop Hitler, and most would agree it was the right thing to do. But Stalin and those that followed him in Soviet Russia were at least as broadly evil as Hitler&rsquo;s Germany, and what did the USA do? Well, we fought in a handful of proxy wars that were pretty much all disasters. And then finally Reagan negotiated and outmaneuvered them until their economic system imploded.</p>
<p>Would Rick Warren like to argue that Ronald Reagan was wrong in that course of action, and that he (or Carter, Ford, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, or Truman before him) should&rsquo;ve just nuked Moscow because they were <strong>EVIL</strong>? I&rsquo;m guessing not.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, I&rsquo;m concerned when I hear appeals urging Christians to write our congressmen and demand action against ISIS because it comes with the strong implication that our leaders either (a) don&rsquo;t understand that ISIS is bad; (b) don&rsquo;t care enough to want to do anything about it; (c) are secretly radical Islamist sympathizers who hate America; or (d) All of the Above.</p>
<p>And maybe I&rsquo;m just not cynical enough, but I think it&rsquo;s quite likely that our President and congress DO understand that ISIS is bad, that they DO want to do something about it, that they&rsquo;re NOT secretly radical Islamists, but that they&rsquo;re people a lot like me who are trying to make very difficult decisions while getting counsel from the foremost experts in these areas that the country (and probably the world) has to offer.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-should-we-do">So what SHOULD we do?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we can pray. Pray that the innocent would be protected. That Christians would be strong in their faith, even to the point of death.</p>
<p>Then pray for ISIS. Pray that they would be challenged by the faith of the Christians whom they are persecuting. Pray for their repentance and that they would come to know Jesus.</p>
<p>I love what <a href="http://tonyreinke.com/2014/08/24/saul-of-tarsus-and-isis/">Matt Chandler said back in a sermon in August</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been reading over and over the conversion of Saul of Tarsus (Acts 9). Murdering Christians. Well known terrorist among evangelical followers of Christ in the first century. Brutal. Powerfully converted and becomes one of the greatest missionaries of the Christian faith. I feel powerless about what’s happening in Iraq, but I’m also praying that God would raise up a Paul out of the leadership of the ISIS. Why not? God is God. He’s done it before. Why wouldn’t he do it today? Lets ask.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> something worth asking for.</p>

			 <p>Wendell Berry is an author many folks have never heard of, but boy, once you get into the right circles, you never hear the end of him. And while I haven&rsquo;t read but a couple of his books, his fans' high praise doesn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable or hyperbolic. Berry is conservative when it comes to culture and community, but then holds positions on environmentalism and pacifism that are more aligned with the political left.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/14005994407_661aac8547_z-554x414.jpg" alt=""> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/festoffaiths/14005994407/in/photolist-nkEobc-9p9kWQ-48cGb-oid2Nt-nY5VHE-dBDTsq-4nqa86-4nuczf-4nq8cM-ed8C4W-9p6eEF-pmH9PM-bQ9Gea-bBf9wG-bBfbAs-bBf9UW-bQ9LAZ-bQ9MDX-aKZ1Yg-6P1DGW-6NWtPv-6WYR9m-7avFas-aK2bR6-4wLHjE-bQ9Lit-bQ9NNp-bBf2VJ-bQ9WwT-bBfj2o-bBfh1m-bBf5UJ-bBf1yy-bQ9SPt-bQ9X8p-bBf5j3-bQ9Pck-bBf2eL-bQ9N2p-bQ9WfR-bBfizN-bQ9XYP-bBfePA-bBeYYq-bQ9Kip-bBf4CQ-bQ9Z8D-bBf3fW-bQ9XBz-bQ9QXi">Festival of Faiths / Flickr</a></p>
<p>All the while, he&rsquo;s a local Kentucky farmer who writes books, poetry, and has received significant awards for doing so. I have many friends today who approach Berry with the sort of awed respect that you can imagine them directing, in a previous era, to C. S. Lewis. (Don&rsquo;t believe me? Just go read <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2010/08/paying-attention-a-visit-with-wendell-berry-and-song-of-the-day/">Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s blog post from 2010</a> where he recounts a visit to meet Berry. It&rsquo;s pretty great.)</p>
<p>My thoughts were directed back to Berry this week after reading <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/wendell-berry-burkean/">a piece on Berry</a> written by Gracy Olmstead on The American Conservative website. It&rsquo;s a delightful interview in which Berry opines in his earthy, plainspoken way about the current state of politics, conservatism, community, and faith.</p>
<p>I love the humor that comes along with the critique, for instance, in his response to this question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GO:</strong> You write a lot about the importance of conservation—which, really, conservatism is supposed to be about. How have conservatives lost an understanding of proper conservation?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &gt; <strong>WB:</strong> For those who enjoy absurdities—as I do, up to a point—“conservatives” opposed to conservation are vibrantly absurd and worth at least a grin. But such conservatives have achieved this amusing absurdity by a radical and dangerous narrowing of purpose. They apparently wish to conserve only the power and wealth of the most powerful and the most wealthy. The conservation of wilderness and “the wild” seems now to be recognized as a project belonging exclusively to “liberals.” But that also is a dangerous narrowing of purpose. It is true that “liberal” conservationists also fairly dependably oppose the most excessive and sensational abuses of “the environment,” such as oil or slurry spills (in some places), surface mining (off and on, never enough), extreme pollution of air and water (mainly as it affects cities), and so on. But in fact most politicians, “conservative” and “liberal,” are the pets or juvenile dependents of the industrial corporations.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In Kentucky, for example, the Party of Coal has swallowed, digested, and shat nearly all politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike. Above all, it is still virtually impossible to interest any of the powers of politics in the economic landscapes of farming and forestry. In those landscapes the gravest and most extensive damages are being done: by soil erosion, by toxic pollution of soil and water, by impairment of the diversity and integrity of ecosystems, by drastic interruptions of the fertility cycle, by the devastation of rural communities and of our never adequately developed cultures of husbandry. There are reasons to hope for and even to foresee the coming of more honesty and better purposes—the need for a sustainable economy, the increasingly obvious failures of industrialism and corporate rule—but no extensive improvements can come easily or soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this rather pointed barb when asked about seemingly continuous wars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe we can hope to make sense of our modern wars until we have acknowledged that war is good for business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a Christian response to war and persecution of Christians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only a few marginal Christians have dared to think that Christianity calls for the radical neighborhood, servanthood, love, and forgiveness that Christ taught. I agree with them, and much against my nature I have tried to make my thoughts consent. I do not say this with confidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this response when asked about his concerns with modern Christianity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know when, why, or how it happened, but at some time the mainstream denominations put themselves in charge of the Sunday job of accrediting people for admission to Heaven, turning the workdays, the human economy, and the material creation over to the materialists. And so it became possible for people to commit their souls to God while participating in an economy dedicated to the swiftest possible extraction and consumption of everything it values in God’s world, with unlimited collateral damage to all creatures, humans included, that it does not value. Once this desecration of creation, of life itself, becomes conventional economic practice, then the submersion of the Gospel in nationalism and the waging of Christian warfare readily follows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love him or hate him, Berry is a fantastic writer, a thoughtful philosopher, a man whose thought we ignore at our own peril. I&rsquo;d encourage you to go read <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/wendell-berry-burkean/">the whole interview at The American Conservative</a>.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few months back I replaced my old (still working) HdHomeRun networked tuner with a newer model (recently rebranded the &ldquo;HDHomeRun Extend&rdquo; which provides H.264 transcoding. I was feeling cheap and so purchased a used model from Amazon for about half the price of new. It is functionally fine but has a small fan that went bad. (Nasty grindy noises from a fan: not good.)</p>
<p>From a bit of online investigation it sounds like SiliconDust (the makers of HDHomeRun) will repair/replace units with bad fans, but given that I got mine second hand that&rsquo;s likely not an option. So, we go to idea #2: add a new fan myself.</p>
<p>A little online browsing pointed me to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVAM1W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000OVAM1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=UZGXOTTEYTSSTU2Q">Nexus 80mm Real Silent Case Fan</a> and $13 and free two-day-shipping later I had one in my hot little hands. Then the fun ensued.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OVAM1W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000OVAM1W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=UZGXOTTEYTSSTU2Q"><img src="/images/2015/fan.jpg" alt="41Imxdn-SNL"></a></p>
<p>The case mod on the HDHR consisted primarily of cutting a hole in the top of the case to let air through. This was accomplished quite effectively with a little cutting wheel and a Dremel tool. Also used the Dremel to drill four holes for the rubber fan mounts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>You can sort of see the hole I cut in the top looking through the middle of it here.</em></p>
<p>The old fan came out easily - just three screws holding it in - and I left the old heatsink in place. I ran the fan wires out of a vent hole in the side of the case, and had to get the soldering iron out to tin the ends of the wires so that they had enough stiffness that I could push them in to the little clip in the fan power connector.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Wires are coming out the side and go up to the new fan&hellip;</em></p>
<p>It all went together quite smoothly and now instead of a noisy grinding fan I have one that runs almost silently to keep all that transcoding circuitry cool. A fun little project and a profitable end!</p>

			 <p>In former days the weather gods spake to us through almanacks and prognosticating rodents, but in these latter days they speak to us through television channels.</p>
<p>In the seventh year of President Obama&rsquo;s reign, the word of the weather gods came to the prophet Cantore, saying:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>&ldquo;Behold, Midwesterners, though thine January hast been mild, and thy hopes look tomorrow toward a groundhog&rsquo;s tidings of early spring, yet before the ground thaws and the streams murmur with hopes of warm weather, a storm shall come upon you the likes of which has not been seen in your environs for many months.</p>
<p>And woe unto you, who live near the Great Lakes, the mid-Atlantic, and the Northeast, for neither shall you be spared. Though your earlier drifts may be melting , yet these storms will restore them to their former height and even beyond, if it be possible.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Behold, Juno and Kari shall come from the north, and Linus from the northwest, and shall fall upon thee with cold and heavy snow. The sun will be blocked out, and in blizzard conditions the visibility shall be near to nothing.</p>
<p><em>The prophet Cantore&rsquo;s message was briefly interrupted by Local on the 8&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<p>For more than 24 hours this storm shall be upon you, leaving as many as twelve inches of snow behind. Once the clouds depart, yet shall the winds remain. And all the low places will be filled up, and the drifts shall rise as high as the horses' bridles.</p>
<p>But this is not the end of sorrows.</p>
<p>For after Kari and Linus have left thee, behold, a clipper from Alberta will visit thee for a time, times, and half a time. It shall bring with it unbearable winds, and temperatures for which the zero on the thermometer is insufficient.</p>
<p>Woe to those who are traveling when these things occur! And pray that thy children have relief from school. We, the weather gods have spoken, who form the storms and call them each by name. Others may speak and promise warmth, but hearken not to them, for they promise falsely of warm-ups which shall disappoint. Maintain thine eyes rather upon the jet stream, for by the jet stream are thou chilled, and by the jet stream thou shalt be warmed in due time.</p>
<p>This cold shall not last forever. Stay tuned to my words, when after a brief message I shall speak of hopes that may bring ye warmth by next week.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in Florida for a work trip this week. It&rsquo;s been a good time so far. Doesn&rsquo;t hurt when the view out your conference room window looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2015/the-beach.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But without further ado, the bullets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental car for this week: Chevy Camaro convertible with about 3000 miles on it. As usual with sports cars, it doesn&rsquo;t have the visibility I&rsquo;m used to in my old Saturn and my minivan.</li>
<li>Amending the previous statement: if you put the top down, the visibility is pretty darn good.</li>
<li>How can you tell the Midwestern boy visiting Florida: it&rsquo;s the coldest week of the winter here (highs only in the low 60s!) and I&rsquo;m driving around with the top down.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been a long-time Tweetbot user but I&rsquo;ve been fooling around with the official Twitter app on my phone the past few days. It&rsquo;s interesting to evaluate the design choices. All the ads, sorry, &ldquo;sponsored tweets&rdquo; in the official app are sure annoying, though.</li>
<li>Last year when I came to this committee meeting, Atlanta got their big ice storm and it took me three extra days to get home. Glad that this year the storm went much further north and won&rsquo;t interfere with getting home.</li>
<li>Watched <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> on the way down here. Not sure it was what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it a lot. The plot seemed far less important than the characters, and I really liked the characters. Merits a second watching.</li>
<li>Then watched <em>The Maze Runner</em> the other night. That was 90 minutes I&rsquo;ll never get back.</li>
<li>I picked up a $199 Samsung Chromebook right before this trip. I&rsquo;m reasonably impressed. Cheap hardware, but still functions pretty well. Will be curious to see how it holds up as I use it more.</li>

<p>This wonderful little bit of insight came across my Twitter feed this morning and I&rsquo;ve been chewing on it all day. It strikes me that this is one key reason why the lyrical content of worship songs sung in church is so important to me.</p>
<p>The insipid worship music designed to inspire a <em>feeling</em> nearly always rubs me the wrong way. I&rsquo;m painfully aware of when my emotions are being manipulated, and I recoil.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when I sing good content, powerful truths, they move me. They sink in and <em>then</em> engage my emotions in worship. But it&rsquo;s the willingness to come to worship and the truth sinking in to my heart that brings the emotion, and not the reverse.</p>
<p>Thanks, Pastor Eugene.</p>

			 <p>There have been some strong reactions across the internet the past couple days to some remarks that Southern Baptist Theological Seminary president Dr. Albert Mohler made on his daily podcast <em>The Briefing</em>. The provocative headline: <a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/?p=33672"><strong>&ldquo;Controversies involving Episcopal leaders affirms liberalism and Christianity two rival religions&rdquo;</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A little ways down in the piece it&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s not talking about political liberalism, but rather <strong>Protestant</strong> liberalism. And he says that Protestant liberalism (he singles out the Episcopal Church) and Christianity are &ldquo;two rival religions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why does he make this audacious claim? He points first to a recent tragedy where a female Episcopal bishop in Massachusetts was driving drunk and hit and killed a bicyclist. Mohler theorizes that the woman was appointed a bishop, even after one prior drunk driving conviction, because &ldquo;the diocese was in a rush to elect a woman as bishop&rdquo;. Secondly Mohler notes that the dean of a leading Episcopal seminary (also in Massachusetts) is stridently lesbian and pro-choice, and is stepping down from her job, Mohler conjectures, not because of those views, but because of financial mismanagement at the school.</p>
<p>Mohler says that these two examples demonstrate that the Episcopal church has a different &ldquo;moral code&rdquo;. (This seems fairly self-evident, albeit with the caveat that not everyone in those denominations may agree with those value norms.)</p>
<p>But then he audaciously claims that because of this different &ldquo;moral code&rdquo;, Episcopalians (and apparently, by extension, the rest of &lsquo;liberal Protestantism&rsquo;) <strong>are not actually Christians</strong>, but rather, &ldquo;rival religions&rdquo; to &ldquo;orthodox Christianity&rdquo; (by which, of course, Mohler doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>Orthodox</em> orthodox, but rather those that agree more closely with his set of beliefs).</p>
<h3 id="by-their-fruit-you-will-recognize-them">By their fruit you will recognize them</h3>
<p>Now we shouldn&rsquo;t be hasty to discount Mohler&rsquo;s evaluation criteria. After all, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 7</a> Jesus says that we will know false teachers by their fruit. &ldquo;A bad tree bears bad fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, to summarize Mohler&rsquo;s argument, these two Episcopal leaders are exemplars of a set of moral priorities that demonstrate that liberal Protestantism isn&rsquo;t, in fact, Christian.</p>
<p>But is it really reasonable to go from observing two pieces of rotten fruit to concluding that the whole section of the orchard is bad?</p>
<h3 id="alrighty-then">Alrighty then&hellip;</h3>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m more than a little astounded that Mohler would suggest that a &ldquo;moral code&rdquo; is what delineates &ldquo;real Christians&rdquo; from &ldquo;rival religions&rdquo;. (Apparently we don&rsquo;t need to worry about theology much? Odd coming from the head of a seminary&hellip;)</p>
<p>But if, from a couple highly-visible examples, it&rsquo;s appropriate to conjecture the &ldquo;moral code&rdquo; and thus orthodoxy of an entire branch of Christianity, let&rsquo;s use Mohler&rsquo;s own Reformed Baptist Evangelicalism as an example.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the case of <strong>C. J. Mahaney</strong>, who while being fawned over at conferences for writing books on humility was also running roughshod over staff without any accountability, had a history that included blackmail of rival leaders in his denomination, and who was at the helm of a denomination that covered up multiple accounts of child abuse.</p>
<p>And then let&rsquo;s consider the case of <strong>Mark Driscoll</strong>, who built a megachurch on his reputation as &ldquo;the cussing pastor&rdquo;, bought his way on to the NYT Bestseller list with church money, and finally resigned in disgrace and saw his church shut down after a plagiarism scandal was the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>What should we conclude from the &ldquo;moral code&rdquo; demonstrated by these two leaders (certainly at least &ldquo;bishops&rdquo; if there were a formal hierarchy) in Mohler&rsquo;s theological circles? Is it fair to suggest that Reformed Baptist Evangelicalism is some sort of rival religion to Christianity because Mohler and many with him embraced these men until their patterns of sin finally became too public to ignore?</p>
<p><strong>Of course not.</strong></p>
<p>Christians, of all people, and reformed, &ldquo;total depravity&rdquo;-believing Christians most of all, should be the first to line up to admit that we are all sinners, and that moral uprightness is (blessedly) not the criteria by which our faith is judged.</p>
<p>Yes, true faith will change how we live, how we calibrate our &ldquo;moral codes&rdquo;, how we allow God to make us more like Jesus every day of our lives. And by all means, let&rsquo;s strive, vigorously, to champion righteousness within (and without!) the church.</p>
<p>But publicly dismissing an entire wing of Protestantism as a &ldquo;rival religion&rdquo; because their set of acceptable sins is different than your own is arrogant foolishness, and Albert Mohler&rsquo;s listeners deserve better.</p>
<p>I have many friends and family in liberal Protestant denominations who I am happy to embrace as brothers and sisters in Christ, even when we disagree on moral priorities. I will continue to learn from them, and hopefully them from me. One day a perfect man will sort us out and open our eyes and show us how wrong we all were in various areas of belief and practice. Thank God that man&rsquo;s name will be Jesus and not, well, anybody else.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday my worship pastor sent out a lead sheet and MP3 for a new song we&rsquo;re going to learn and sing this coming weekend at church, and it&rsquo;s causing me some odd internal conflicts. Not because I hate the song, or because I think the content of the song is bad or anything like that. No, it&rsquo;s because I opened up the lead sheet and had a strong reaction to the name of one of the songwriters. In this case, the song is called &ldquo;Only King Forever&rdquo; by Elevation Worship, and the songwriter in question is the pastor of Elevation Church, Steven Furtick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLuORCnBJls">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>This is not about my pastor&rsquo;s choice of this song or about Furtick specifically. I don&rsquo;t want to get into those arguments. What it <strong>is</strong> about is this question that&rsquo;s nagging me. How much should my opinion of a songwriter affect my reaction to their songs?</p>
<h3 id="dont-go-dissing-on-my-fun-music">Don&rsquo;t go dissing on my fun music</h3>
<p>First off, let&rsquo;s agree that this is specifically about songs used for worship in church services. Because when it comes to music I listen to for fun, I really don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;ve honestly got very little idea what Sergei Rachmaninov&rsquo;s theology, morality, or politics were, but he&rsquo;s still my favorite classical composer because his music is awesome. Heck, I&rsquo;ve got a pretty good idea that John, Paul, George, and Ringo had fairly lousy theology and morality, but that doesn&rsquo;t prevent me from enjoying a good Beatles song.</p>
<p>But when we get to &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; music, and more specifically worship music, the dynamic changes somewhat, though the Christian/church music industry&rsquo;s application of standards seems to be uneven. For example, Jennifer Knapp&rsquo;s excellent record <em>Kansas</em> fell out of Christian music favor when she came out as a lesbian. On the other hand, Phillips, Craig, and Dean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips,_Craig_and_Dean#Theological_criticism">don&rsquo;t believe in the Trinity</a> and still get played <em>ad nauseum</em> on Christian radio.</p>
<h3 id="did-you-just-forget-to-take-your-cynical-pills-today-hubbs">Did you just forget to take your cynical pills today, Hubbs?</h3>
<p>So then we come to this song, and Steven Furtick. What&rsquo;s the issue with Furtick? Well, maybe it&rsquo;s me as much as anything. He&rsquo;s a megachurch pastor from Charlotte, NC, in the Southern Baptist denomination. Good enough so far. However, there have been some significant concerns raised in the past couple years when his church had <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2014/02/24/megachurch-pastor-steven-furticks-spontaneous-baptisms-spontaneous/">&ldquo;plants&rdquo; in the congregation to &ldquo;spontaneously&rdquo; come up for baptism</a> and when he built an <a href="http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/the_house_that_steven_built">8500-square-foot mansion on a 19-acre lot in a gated development from an undisclosed church salary and book deal</a>. And if I&rsquo;m honest, I&rsquo;ve watched some of his sermon videos, and there&rsquo;s something about the guy and his approach that just feels wrong, that gives me the creeps. It&rsquo;s not humble teaching and servant leadership to make disciples; rather, it&rsquo;s manipulative performance art for the sake of inspiring giving and driving attendance/membership numbers.</p>
<p>(Again, I&rsquo;m not claiming that I&rsquo;m completely right here about Furtick - only describing why I have the reaction I have to him when his name comes up.)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have any issues with the content of the song itself; it seems theologically sound, certainly more Jesus-proclaiming and less mushy than some other stuff we sing. But I&rsquo;m still struggling to get past the authorship.</p>
<p>Am I holding a double-standard here? Probably. I mean, sure, we&rsquo;ve all heard about Horatio Spafford writing &ldquo;It Is Well With My Soul&rdquo; after a great personal tragedy, and stories about Fanny Crosby&rsquo;s saintly approach to her blindness, and I&rsquo;ve heard good things about that Charles Wesley guy who wrote a bunch of solid hymns. But I know very little about the personal lives or theologies of most of the other songwriters whose songs we sing on Sundays. And in general that&rsquo;s OK with me. As long as the song is good, let&rsquo;s sing it.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>But, Chris, you sing songs written by Pentecostals and Catholics and others of every theological stripe and enjoy them. Why is this different?</strong></p>
<p>It <em>does</em> seem different somehow. I think it&rsquo;s because in those cases, while I don&rsquo;t personally agree with those folks' theology, I can understand how someone could, I find it reasonable, and I wouldn&rsquo;t shy away from recommending someone attend one of those churches if it otherwise made sense for them. Furtick&rsquo;s case is different. It&rsquo;s not necessarily his theology, but his personality and apparent views toward leadership and money and pastoring. I can&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;d ever recommend that somebody go attend his church.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t your attitude then just basically &lsquo;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&rsquo; with regard to songwriters' beliefs and personalities?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I guess maybe it is. But hey, don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell has some Biblical basis, after all. Isn&rsquo;t that what Paul basically advised Corinthian Christians with regard to eating meat sacrificed to idols?</p>
<p><strong>Hey, couldn&rsquo;t we just solve this by singing nothing but Psalms in church?</strong></p>
<p>Well I dunno, King David wrote most of those and he wasn&rsquo;t always an upstanding moral example, either&hellip; wait, you&rsquo;re just trying to confuse me now, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><strong>Well, maybe&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, we&rsquo;ll be singing the song on Sunday, and if it seems like a good fit, likely many Sundays after that. I suppose I&rsquo;ll learn to live with the internal conflict. Maybe my friend Jason summed it up best:</p>

			 <p>I would never have run across this album were it not for <a href="https://twitter.com/Overstweet/status/554156576886358016">Jeffrey Overstreet tweeting about it</a> yesterday. (Thanks, Jeff!)</p>
<p><a href="http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd">Laghdú</a> is a new album of Irish fiddle music played by Caoimhín Ó Raghallaigh and Dan Trueman. These guys are playing unique, custom <a href="http://www.fiolinmaker.no/en/instrumenter/5pluss5.php">10-string fiddles</a> and creating a fascinating, minimalist style.</p>
<p>The music is wonderful and difficult to describe all at the same time; think Arvo Pärt meets traditional Irish fiddle playing, or, as @ChadComello responded to Overstreet, it&rsquo;s as if Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead guitarist and composer of film scores to <em>There Will Be Blood</em> and <em>The Master</em>) had scored Braveheart.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample:</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/92712357">vimeo.com/92712357</a></p>
<p>You can download the MP3 (or other audio format of your choice) for &ldquo;name your price&rdquo; (including free, though it&rsquo;s worth a donation) <a href="http://store.irishmusic.net/album/laghd">at their website</a>.</p>

			 <p>We got my first computer when I was 7. My dad was writing a book, so bought a little PC with two 5.25&quot; floppy drives and a monochrome monitor. (Ah, the good old days when you had to put the MS-DOS disk in to boot, then remove it to put in a program disk.)</p>
<p>Dad had a tech-savvy friend come over to show him how to run Wordstar and Datastar while I looked on over their shoulders with great interest. I apparently soaked it in pretty well, because it wasn&rsquo;t long before Dad would call me in to answer his questions before calling his friend, and 30 years later I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;computer guy&rdquo; with an engineering degree and a programming job and still actively in family tech support.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As my three daughters have gotten older (the oldest is 10), I&rsquo;ve uneasily looked forward to a day when there&rsquo;s some issue of tech which has me confused and one of them says &ldquo;oh, Dad, it&rsquo;s easy! Here, let me show you&hellip;&rdquo; But I&rsquo;ve always figured it would be quite a way off.</p>
<p>But then yesterday after some begging and pleading for a membership on some money-grubbing movie-associated game site, we settled on a different option: the full-blown version of <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Parents these days are probably familiar with the game, at least by name. It&rsquo;s a low-res graphics world-building game that has Creative and Survival modes and the ability to play solo or to join up to servers on the internet to collaborate with others. The girls have been playing a stripped-down iPad version for months, but got a few Minecraft books for Christmas and have been wishing for the full version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So last night I bit the bullet, bought licenses so they can play concurrently, and set up a local server so they can play together w/o having to deal with the outside world. But once I showed them how to log in and start the program, I realized something: <strong>that&rsquo;s all I know about it</strong>.</p>
<p>If they have questions about how to do something in the game, I&rsquo;ve got no clue. I had to Google to figure out what the keyboard controls were for my five-year-old since the 10-year-old had the book in the basement.</p>
<p>They played the game for 30 minutes before dinner last night and while at the dinner table it was non-stop jabber about what they had discovered. &ldquo;Hey, did you know how to do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you know that if you do <em>that</em> then <em>this</em> will happen?&rdquo; &ldquo;I made it do <strong>this</strong>!&rdquo; But while I loved their excitement, I&rsquo;ll admit that the rest of it sounded like Greek to me. I&rsquo;ve got no clue.</p>
<p>In many respects it feels like a new era. Here&rsquo;s a computer-based thing that they know and I don&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;m cool with that. Really. * <em>deep breath</em> *</p>
<p>My ten-year-old is getting into programming and if that persists, we&rsquo;ll get a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> for her birthday and then I&rsquo;ll be able to prove (at least for a little while, I hope) that I&rsquo;ve still got a thing or two to teach her about technology.</p>
<p>But kiddo, fair warning: at this point you may as well start counting down the days until <strong>you</strong> starts getting phone calls from <strong>me</strong>. You have been warned.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>The Fall is where the nation is… Americans have become so beleaguered by anxiety and fatigue, so bemused and intimidated, so beset by a sense of impotence and by intuitions of calamity, that they have, for the most part, become consigned to despair. The people have been existing under a state of such interminable warfare that it seems normative. There is little resistance to the official Orwellian designation of war as peace, nor does that rhetorical deception come near exhausting the ways in which the people have found the government to be unworthy of credence or trust. Racial conflict has been suppressed by an elaborate apartheid; products which supposedly mean abundance or convenience turn out to contaminate or jeopardize life; the environment itself is rendered hostile; there is pervasive babel; privacy is a memory because surveillance is ubiquitous; institutional coercion of human beings has proliferated relentlessly. Whatever must be said of earlier times, in the past quarter century America has become a technological totalitarianism in which hope, in its ordinary human connotations, is being annihilated. … Americans have been learning, harshly, redundantly, that they inherit or otherwise possess no virtue or no vanity which dispels the condition of death manifest everywhere in the nation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well, with 2014 in the books it&rsquo;s time for my annual little review of my reading. This was a busy reading year for me - 74 books equals the most I&rsquo;ve read in a year since I started logging my reading back in 2007.</p>
<p>My fiction/non-fiction split was pretty heavily weighted in the non-fiction direction - 45 non to 29 fiction. That non-fiction was pretty well distributed, too, still a lot of theology, but a good bit of history, biography, and economics. (And economics was more than just Piketty. Go me!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=2014-reads">The full list is on Goodreads</a> but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<h3 id="the-best">The Best</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061988219/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061988219&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=GMXEX2P7JKT76GD2"><em>The Pastor: A Memoir</em></a> by Eugene Peterson</strong></p>
<p>This is a beautifully-written memoir by a much beloved pastor and author. Peterson tells stories from his years of ministry, emphasizing the call to a simple, faithful pastoral ministry. (Such a breath of fresh air in the days of celebrity megachurch pastors!) This was the volume I gave away as Christmas gifts this year. Really good.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393339041/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393339041&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=4WZRDHDZLGSFA6CN"><em>From Bible Belt to Sunbelt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism</em></a> by Darren Dochuk</strong></p>
<p>A detailed history of the roots of American Evangelicalism, from the Oklahoma radio evangelists of the 1930s, through the migration to Southern California, through the rise of Billy Graham, and all the way to the Moral Majority of Jerry Fallwell. Dochuk&rsquo;s history is quite readable and fascinating for a guy like me who grew up in evangelicalism but didn&rsquo;t really know its roots.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0996049908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0996049908&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=LCDXTXNYMKDWZQLR"><em>The Anglican Way: A Guidebook</em></a> by Fr. Thomas Mackenzie</strong></p>
<p>I chipped in on the Kickstarter campaign for this book back in 2013, and boy was it ever worth it. Thomas, pastor at Church of the Redeemer in Nashville, wrote an introduction to Anglicanism for those Christians who may not be familiar with the tradition. Fr. Thomas: almost thou persuadest me to become an Anglican.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316098809/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316098809&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=NQ7Y3DELCLLUSBFS"><em>The Rook: A Novel</em></a> by Daniel O&rsquo;Malley</strong></p>
<p>This was my last book of the year, so hopefully I&rsquo;m not just biased because it&rsquo;s fresh in my memory. This was a great read, though, if you&rsquo;re into the sort of supernatural spy mystery/thriller sort of thing. Funny, moves quick, keeps things interesting. Looking forward to the second book in the series sometime next year.</p>
<h3 id="thats-not-all">That&rsquo;s Not All</h3>
<p>In addition to those titles I also gave five star ratings to some classics that I re-read (several of the Harry Potter novels, read out loud with the family) or read for the first time (<em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> was a notable gap in my experience.)</p>
<p>A vast majority of the books I read this year garnered either four or five stars. I hope this is because I did a better job of not wasting my time on books that never captured my interest. The (100 pages - your age) formula has been effective this year. If, 60-ish pages in I&rsquo;m not engaged and enjoying the read, I&rsquo;m not going to feel compelled to keep reading it.</p>
<h3 id="up-next">Up Next</h3>
<p>I still have a pile (though not as sizable as it once was) next to my bed that will keep my reading well into 2015. Most likely I will be reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer</strong> by Tim Keller. (It&rsquo;s Keller. Duh.)</li>
<li><strong>Kristin Lavransdatter</strong> by Sigrid Unset. (A historical novel written in the early 1920s by a Norwegian author who won the Nobel Prize for literature. Obscure but highly recommended by those in the know.)</li>
<li><strong>Theodore Rex</strong> by Edmund Morris. The next volume of his Theodore Roosevelt biography. The last one was excellent.</li>
<li><strong>Paul and the Faithfulness of God</strong> by N. T. Wright. I got this one for Christmas <em>last</em> year and didn&rsquo;t get very far. I think I&rsquo;m ready to give it a go here sometime soon.</li>
<li><strong>Lila</strong> by Marilynne Robinson. Her follow-up to the excellent <em>Gilead</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy 2015, everybody!</p>

			 <p>I ran across this fantastic prayer this morning in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2014/12/pope-francis-reveals-a-saint-he-prays-to-every-day/">a story about Pope Francis</a>. (Reportedly the Pope prays this prayer daily.) It&rsquo;s beautiful, funny, and practical all in one.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="prayer-for-good-humor">Prayer for Good Humor</h4>
<p>Grant me, O Lord, good digestion, and also something to digest. Grant me a healthy body, and the necessary good humor to maintain it. Grant me a simple soul that knows to treasure all that is good and that doesn’t frighten easily at the sight of evil, but rather finds the means to put things back in their place. Give me a soul that knows not boredom, grumblings, sighs and laments, nor excess of stress, because of that obstructing thing called “I.” Grant me, O Lord, a sense of good humor. Allow me the grace to be able to take a joke to discover in life a bit of joy, and to be able to share it with others. -St. Thomas More, Chancellor to King Henry VIII</p>

<p>These two tweets showed up on my timeline within 10 minutes of each other this morning. And they highlight a fundamental concern I have with the intellectual defense arguments for the Gospel.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I&rsquo;m not advocating a check-your-brain-at-the-door version of Christianity. But I think Zahnd is right - arguments by themselves don&rsquo;t win people.</p>
<p>I mean, hey, the next time a Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness approaches you at a restaurant or bar you can grab the nearest napkin and <a href="http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2014/12/17/how-to-use-the-back-of-a-napkin-to-prove-to-a-jehovahs-witness-that-jesus-is-god/">sketch out a little grid</a> that will logically completely prove that you&rsquo;re right and they&rsquo;re wrong. But if you think that once you&rsquo;ve done that the JW is going to tear up their Watchtower and come to your evangelical church next Sunday, you&rsquo;ve got another think coming.</p>
<p>When I look over my own spiritual progression of the past two decades, I&rsquo;ve never had an intellectual <em>Eureka!</em> moment change my beliefs. (I might almost say that reading NTW&rsquo;s <em>Surprised by Hope</em> was that sort of experience, but that was more putting words and reason to what I knew must be true but hadn&rsquo;t heard expressed before.) What <em>has</em> changed me is a long, persistent interaction with other believers over time.</p>
<p>Changes haven&rsquo;t come by having my arm twisted; they&rsquo;ve come by others gently taking my hand and saying &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m headed this way, what do you think?&rdquo;. Sure, occasionally an earthquake radically moves things in a moment; far more often wind and rain slowly shape new paths where before there were none.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> saying here, so don&rsquo;t hear them. I&rsquo;m not saying that we should never present logical arguments for the Gospel, or that we shouldn&rsquo;t share it with JWs or anyone else that comes along. I&rsquo;m glad that there are people who have written great intellectual defenses of the Christian faith. I&rsquo;m not saying that God can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t use a direct presentation of the Gospel as the tool to bring someone to faith.</p>
<p>But the attitude of &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the diagram you need to know to prove the JWs wrong&rdquo; greatly neglects the realities of <em>how</em> people change, and instead encourages an attitude of intellectual superiority. Please don&rsquo;t go out there with the attitude that any unbeliever will suddenly see the light if only you can draw the right back-of-the-napkin diagram.</p>
<p>We of all people should recognize that it is only God&rsquo;s action to open our eyes that brings us to faith, and <strong>that</strong> should provoke in us not an intellectual arrogance but rather a great humility.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve felt a need for Advent far more keenly this year than I recall from previous years. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the tumult of the times - with religious violence abroad and racial tension at home, it is so clear that we need the peace, deliverance, and salvation that Jesus brings now more than ever.</p>
<p>That brings me to Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s <a href="https://store.rabbitroom.com/product/behold-the-lamb-of-god-2-cd-set"><em>Behold the Lamb of God</em></a>. It&rsquo;s long been my favorite Christmas record; in my estimation it&rsquo;s one of only two or three perfect Christian records to have been made. Early in the record as Andrew tells the story of Christ, the song &ldquo;Deliver Us&rdquo; introduces the longing cry of God&rsquo;s people for God&rsquo;s salvation. And the lyrics seem as appropriate today as ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemy, our captor is no pharaoh on the Nile
Our toil is neither mud nor brick nor sand
Our ankles bear no calluses from chains, yet Lord, we&rsquo;re bound
Imprisoned here, we dwell in our own land<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>Deliver us, deliver us Oh Yahweh, hear our cry</em> &gt; <em>And gather us beneath your wings tonight</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Our sins they are more numerous than all the lambs we slay<br>
These shackles they were made with our own hands
Our toil is our atonement and our freedom yours to give
So Yahweh, break your silence if you can<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>Deliver us, deliver us Oh Yahweh, hear our cry</em> &gt; <em>And gather us beneath your wings tonight</em><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
[Response:] &lsquo;Jerusalem, Jerusalem How often I have longed To gather you beneath my gentle wings&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come, Lord Jesus.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/inebriateme/2014/12/its-not-the-war-on-christmas-its-the-war-of-christmas/">@pegobry with a great post about the subversive and challenging nature of Christ&rsquo;s advent:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a war on Christmas? No, there’s no war on Christmas. There’s a war <em>of</em> Christmas. Because that’s what Christmas is: a declaration of war. Against all the thrones, dominions, principalities and powers who hold creation in bondage. Saying there’s a war on Christmas is like saying the Germans fought a war on D-Day–of <em>course</em> there’s a war on Christmas. How do we fight this war? Not by yelling at Walmart greeters who say “Happy Holidays.” Not with consumerism. Like Jesus fought his. With increased penance and asceticism and prayer and reception of the sacraments. With corporeal works of mercy. With peace, mercy, some truth-telling, and a very large heaping of loving-kindness. This is our D-Day: this is the most stupendous claim of Christianity.</p>

<p>PEG sounds like he&rsquo;s been reading his NT Wright. Really good stuff.</p>

			 <p>On the topic of <a href="/14/11/o-bother-where-art-thou/">my previous post</a>, I had this Twitter interaction with Stephen Granade:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/530411427744321536">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/530411855198441472">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p>But then I started wondering&hellip; what about <em>Lebowski</em>?</p>
<p>So then I had to do it - casting <em>The Big Lebowski</em> using Winnie the Pooh characters.</p>
<h3 id="the-dude">The Dude</h3>
<p>This one is pretty obvious. Winnie the Pooh himself gets to play The Dude. His laid-back personality is nicely analogous to Jeff Bridges' beloved stoner.</p>
<h3 id="walter-sobchak">Walter Sobchak</h3>
<p>Based on my Twitter assertion, I&rsquo;m gonna commit to it. Tigger is the only Hundred-Acre Wood inhabitant with a personality big enough to play a John Goodman character. Think of it as the grittier side of Tigger. You know he&rsquo;s not always been such a jovial tiger.</p>
<h3 id="donny">Donny</h3>
<p>Who&rsquo;s gonna be the weasely, nervous sidekick to Tigger&rsquo;s Walter? I think it&rsquo;s gotta be Piglet.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>A large, pompous man with a big attitude? Owl gets to play this role, no question about it. And then to serve his needs:</p>
<h3 id="brandt">Brandt</h3>
<p>This nervous young assistant (played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman in <em>Lebowski</em>) goes to Rabbit. You can just see him puttering around straightening all of Lebowski&rsquo;s photos and trophies outside his office.</p>
<h3 id="minor-characters">Minor Characters</h3>
<ul>
<li>With Kanga being the token female in the Hundred-Acre Wood, we&rsquo;ll give her the role of Maude Lebowski.</li>
<li>Christopher Robin would have to paste on a mustache and work on his Texas accent, but we&rsquo;ll give him the role of The Stranger.</li>
<li>And where&rsquo;s Eeyore in this whole thing? Based on his general outlook on life, I think he&rsquo;s one of the Nihilists. However, as my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Pulpiteer">Andy</a> said:</li>

			 <p>My wife and kids have been gone for the past two days. They planned a trip to visit Grandma for dates where I had planned to be on a business trip. The business trip got cancelled, but the trip to Grandma&rsquo;s remained. So, for the past two nights I&rsquo;ve had the house entirely to myself. As far as I can recall, this is the first time such a thing has happened since we&rsquo;ve had kids.</p>
<p>So how have I lived it up as a bachelor for the past two days?</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked late both days</li>
<li>Read a book while eating out at my favorite restaurant one night</li>
<li>Take-and-bake pizza the second night (hey, I got to choose the toppings <strong>I</strong> wanted!)</li>
<li>Rented two DVDs from the local video store and proceeded to watch other movies on Netflix instead</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>have</em> managed to get the trash out on the correct day, the dishes washed, and the mail brought in from the mailbox. Haven&rsquo;t done much else, though.</p>
<p>The house is really quiet with everybody gone. I&rsquo;ve burned through more podcasts in the past two days than in the prior two weeks just to have something to break up the silence. I think the cat is taking it harder than I am - he has actually acknowledged my presence these past couple of days, and while he still refuses to sit on my lap, he has been willing to sit up on the top of my chair while I&rsquo;m sitting watching TV.</p>
<p>The family returns to the house this afternoon, and all the lovely noise and chaos along with them.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p>

			 <p>I went on a quick business trip this week which gave me several hours of airplane time to do some reading. I finished up both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AAW5EDG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00AAW5EDG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=FVXJLIQDNX6RC7RE"><em>Confessions</em> by St. Augustine</a> (a foundational bit of Christian theology from a millenium ago) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSIS6W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZSIS6W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=DZRRXRLDGNYT3CEU"><em>The God Who Risks: A Theology of Divine Providence</em> by John Sanders</a> (a rather dense defense of open theism from not too many years ago).</p>
<p>I read a lot, and being the nerd that I am, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80101-chris-hubbs">I keep a log of my reading over on Goodreads</a>. And when you add a book to your shelves on Goodreads, it prompts you to rate the book, using a 1 - 5 star rating system. Being the nerd that I am, I can&rsquo;t <em>not</em> rate them. And so as I add the books to my &ldquo;read&rdquo; shelf and to the shelf for the current year, I also give them a star rating, and those star ratings are automatically tweeted on <a href="http://twitter.com/cjhubbs">my Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>So, back to this week. Not only did I finish both <em>Confessions</em> and <em>The God Who Risks</em>, but I gave them both 4 stars. Having the temerity to even assign a star rating to St. Augustine got me a bit of good-natured flack on Twitter. So I figured it was time (for my own sake, at least) to explain how I assign star ratings. (To the 3 of you who want to continue reading past this point: seek professional help.)</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m rating fiction or non-fiction, I tend to value similar traits in a book: well-written prose; an engaging topic; a coherent plot or argument; an appropriate length. I&rsquo;ve gotten choosier over the years and more willing to give up on lame books. (It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to find fiction that&rsquo;s worth my time.) When I&rsquo;m reading non-fiction, and particularly theology, my rating isn&rsquo;t based at all on the relative importance of the work in history (I&rsquo;m actually not well-qualified to judge that) or whether I agree with the position being argued. I <em>will</em> base my rating, though, on how even-handed the author was in argument, how well I felt like the case was made, and how well the book kept my interest. I also like to reserve 5-star ratings for books that are really top-notch, can&rsquo;t-beat-em volumes. The ones that make a significant impact on me, that I want to read again or buy copies for other people.</p>
<p>So, Augustine got 4 stars for <em>Confessions</em>. The translation I read (downloaded for <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3296">free from Project Gutenberg</a>) was a little big of a slog, but significant chunks of it were (in my untrained opinion) quite brilliant, and kept me thinking. Definitely glad I read it. Quite certain I don&rsquo;t have the seminary education I&rsquo;d need to understand how it molds the next thousand years of Christian thought.</p>
<p>But Sanders also gets 4 stars for <em>The God Who Risks</em>. It&rsquo;s also a bit of a slog. (At one point in the text he refers back to an earlier section in the book by its section number, something like 3.4.6.2-5. That&rsquo;s some serious outlining going on.) Still, Sanders makes a reasonable argument for openness and I felt like he dealt fairly with the topic and opposing viewpoints. I don&rsquo;t know that I completely agree with him, but I&rsquo;m glad I read the book and gained a better understanding of that perspective of the topic.</p>
<p>Mid-way through writing this post I went and counted up the number of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?shelf=read&amp;sort=rating">5-star reviews I&rsquo;ve given on Goodreads</a>. Of 530-ish books I&rsquo;ve read, I&rsquo;ve given 5 stars to about 70. (That&rsquo;s more than I would&rsquo;ve thought if you&rsquo;d asked me.) I&rsquo;ve given 5 stars to more non-fiction than fiction; some history and biography, a lot of theology, and a bunch of classic fiction. Upon reflection, does Augustine deserve 5 stars for <em>Confessions</em>? Yeah, probably. Maybe I should go do a re-read and see if I have a better appreciation for it after another go-round. On the other hand, maybe if I&rsquo;m allowing myself the cheekiness of assigning reviews at all I shouldn&rsquo;t be ashamed of just assigning scores as I see them.</p>
<p>In the end, I&rsquo;m glad to have that list of books and the associated ratings, if only to look back and remember some favorites, help me recommend books to others, and to find some re-reads. And, I suppose, because I&rsquo;m a nerd. Somethings never change.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="/04/10/this-is-my-first-post/">first post on this blog</a> was written on October 29, 2004, in typical new-blogger fashion noting that I had a new blog. Over the past 10 years I&rsquo;ve written 1597 posts, squashed innumerable spam comments, migrated themes a few times, and even tried a non-Wordpress blog engine for a bit.</p>
<p>10 years ago I was still in my 20s, had only one child (a baby), was leading music at a little Baptist church, writing software for my employer, and had been in the first home we owned for about a year. Today I&rsquo;m much closer to 40, have three kids all now school aged, lead music at a bigger EFCA church, still work at the same firm though I haven&rsquo;t written a line of airborne code in years, but we&rsquo;re still in that same little house.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure why people still read my blog; I&rsquo;m an inconsistent writer and go on far too much about music, books I&rsquo;m reading, and generally nerdy stuff. I&rsquo;ve passed my theo-rage-blogging phase, so I&rsquo;m not likely to get linked by any of <em>those</em> folks any more. (Pretty sure my biggest day in terms of visits was a Saturday that Rachel Held Evans tweeted a link to something I wrote. That&rsquo;ll likely never happen again.)</p>
<p>I have no idea what blogging will look like another 10 years from now, but assuming it&rsquo;s still around in some form I imagine I&rsquo;ll still be doing it. After all, where else can I narcissistically blather on with my own image staring skeptically at me from the sidebar and delude myself into thinking that people read it and find it meaningful?</p>

			 <p><a href="http://marshill.com/2014/10/15/pastor-mark-driscolls-resignation">Mark Driscoll resigned today from the pastorate of Mars Hill Church in Seattle.</a> Driscoll has been embattled in several controversies over the past year including allegations of plagiarism, verbal abuse of staff. For the past several weeks he had been on a leave of absence while a small group of Mars Hill leaders investigated a long list of charges brought against him by many former church pastors, elders, members, and staff.</p>
<p>Driscoll&rsquo;s resignation is he latest blow to a church already staggering under the recent closure of several campuses and the resignations of many other pastors and staff.</p>
<p>I will continue to pray for Driscoll, his family, and the many people who have been hurt by his words and actions over the past years. I hope this can be the first step in a process of healing and reconciliation for all concerned.</p>
<p>That might be a good place to stop this post, and yet there is more I think it&rsquo;s worth saying. Perhaps you may think it uncharitable to say any more, but I think not. I get no pleasure out of Driscoll&rsquo;s resignation, and want to hope that this is really his first step on the road to repentance. And yet to be as wise as serpents we should consider what he said as well as his actions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2014/10/15/exclusive-mark-driscolls-resignation-letter-to-mars-hill-church/">Driscoll&rsquo;s resignation letter</a> is addressed to the Mars Hill board of investigation, but was clearly written with a broader audience in mind. In the letter Driscoll didn&rsquo;t confess to anything that hadn&rsquo;t been addressed before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I readily acknowledge I am an imperfect messenger of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of thoughts here: first, that we <strong>are all</strong> imperfect messengers of the gospel. Which makes this a very non-specific confession of something that he doesn&rsquo;t even identify as sin. Yes, he reiterates confession of &lsquo;past&rsquo; pride, anger and a domineering spirit, but doesn&rsquo;t address any of the multitude of very specific charges that have been levied against him. Second, he doesn&rsquo;t address the plagiarism or the use of a quarter million dollars of church money to get his book on the NYT Bestseller List.</p>
<p>Driscoll still seems to be blaming others a lot for the situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many of those making charges against me declined to meet with you or participate in the review process at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family—even physically unsafe at times&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While these statements may be true, they seem to be deflecting attention from his faults and calling attention to his accusers. This hardly seems like a contrite spirit of repentance.</p>
<p>In addition, he says his resignation is <strong>not</strong> because he did anything wrong, but because &ldquo;aspects of [his] personality and leadership style have proven to be divisive within the Mars Hill context&rdquo; and it would be best &ldquo;for the health of [his] family, and for the Mars Hill family, that we step aside&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He also emphasizes that there haven&rsquo;t been any charges of anything criminal, [sexually] immoral, or heretical, which would disqualify him from ministry. The Mars Hill board who investigated him also state that he is still qualified for pastoral ministry. My question here is how the scope of qualification has been narrowed so far that only crime, sexual immorality, or heresy will disqualify you. Consider 1 Timothy 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. Now the overseer is to be <strong>above reproach</strong>, faithful to his wife, <strong>temperate, self-controlled, respectable</strong>, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, <strong>not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome</strong>, not a lover of money. He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect. (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) <strong>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.</strong> He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.</p>

<p>This is a sobering text for anyone considering a call as an elder. But if we truly believe these are the qualifications for the office, Driscoll, by his own admission in many cases, is disqualified.</p>
<p>As a friend of mine noted, this move by Driscoll also allows him to leave on his own terms, and to suddenly place himself outside of any structure that could hold him accountable. (This, too, seems to have been a pattern of Driscoll&rsquo;s over the years.)</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what becomes of this situation over the coming months. This isn&rsquo;t the end of difficulties at Mars Hill; there are still <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/10/01/internal-memo-about-mars-hills-global-fund-shows-the-church-intended-to-use-some-of-the-money-to-deflect-criticism-and-quietly-keep-the-r">the Global Fund shenanigans</a> to deal with that may yet bring additional charges. Will the neo-Reformed types who once championed but more recently distanced themselves from Driscoll take this opportunity to now declare him again fit for ministry and bring him back into the regular rotation of conferences and book deals? Or will there be a longer-term awareness that there is confession, repentance, healing, and reconciliation that needs to occur?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far and think I&rsquo;ve been unfair to Mark, take a few minutes and go read some of the other statements of confession that have come from Mars Hill pastors: <a href="http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/lief-mois-confession-2/">Lief Moi</a>, <a href="http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/jeff-bettgers-confession/">Jeff Bettger</a>, <a href="http://repentantpastor.com/confessions/kyle-firstenbergs-confession/">Kyle Firstenberg</a>&hellip; Then compare them in detail and tone to what Driscoll is saying. One of them is not like the others, and we should not be afraid to ask ourselves why.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue to pray for the Mark Driscoll and his family, for Mars Hill Church, and for all those who have been affected, both positively and negatively, by Driscoll over the years. God&rsquo;s heart is for grace, healing, and reconciliation. Ours should be, too.</p>

When it comes to their lives, especially those with whom we disagree, we suddenly possess the ability to derive a doctorate thesis’ worth of conclusions about their story and motivations, from only the smallest fragments of data. &ldquo;You follow Marc [sic] Driscoll (or Rob Bell) and John Piper (or Brian McLaren) on Twitter? - Then I know what you&rsquo;re ALL about.&rdquo; * disapproving grimace *</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/10/08/paul-counting-his.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-10-08 07:09:43 -0500">Oct 8, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.politicaltheology.com/blog/the-politics-of-privilege-philippians-34a-14/">an interesting piece from Alistair Roberts over on Political Theology today</a>. Roberts thinks through Philippians 3:4-14 and has a slightly different perspective than most I&rsquo;ve read before.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3 Paul recounts his credentials:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. 8 More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve typically read and heard this taught as Paul recounting all of his accomplishments, and then recognizing that his good works were worth nothing compared to knowing Christ. But, Roberts suggests, we should recognize that much of what Paul recounts here isn&rsquo;t a result of his work, but <em>of his position from birth</em>. Roberts draws a striking analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the identity that Paul is describing here is not that of the classic legalist, what is it? I believe that an analogous sort of identity could be found in <strong>the patriot</strong>. Paul wasn’t that unlike the patriot who takes pride in the fact that he is a true American (as opposed to all of those unwelcome immigrants). His family’s presence on American soil dates back to the Mayflower. His forefathers fought for their country. From as early as he can remember, he has been steeped in American culture. He has a large stars and stripes flying outside of his house and a wall devoted to portraits of the presidents within. He is a hard worker who is living his own American dream, attending church twice a week, and putting money back into his community. He only buys American products, he devotes himself to studying American history, and has always been politically involved and invested in the wellbeing of the nation. The ‘performance’ of such a patriot isn’t undertaken to ‘earn’ American status, but to demonstrate and broadcast his claims to it, to mark him out from those who aren’t Americans (or are ‘lesser’ Americans), and more fully to ground and celebrate his sense of identity in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an angle worth considering in a day when American exceptionalism and Evangelicalism usually go hand in hand.</p>

			 <p>I started an Arvo Pärt station on Pandora earlier this week and one of the artists that kept coming up was someone by the name of <a href="http://olafurarnalds.com/">Ólafur Arnalds</a>. Having never heard of Arnalds, I set off to learn more, and to listen. And I liked what I found.</p>
<p>Arnalds is a young (still in his 20s!) Icelandic composer/musician whose sweet spot musically is sort of minimalist ambient instrumentals. Think Sigur Rós without all of Jónsi&rsquo;s vocals and turned down a couple notches on the intensity meter. Or think happier Phillip Glass, or what you&rsquo;d get if you crossed Brian Eno&rsquo;s ambient stuff with Jim Brickman&rsquo;s piano and harmonies. However you get there, his music pretty well hits a sweet spot for me, especially as these grey fall days start to fade to winter.</p>
<p><em>Side note: if you&rsquo;re pedantic like me, writing about ambient European musicians will also make you learn to find all the accented letter character key codes. You have been warned.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>I really enjoyed Richard Beck&rsquo;s <em>Unclean</em>.</li>

<li>I started O&rsquo;Donavan&rsquo;s <em>Resurrection and Moral Order</em> and wow, it&rsquo;s dense. That&rsquo;s not necessarily bad, but wow. Of course, maybe I should&rsquo;ve taken the hint when Alistair Roberts told me that you had best read it slowly.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/09/10/mpt-problems-with.html">MPT: 20 Problems with Progressive Christianity</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/09/10/mpt-problems-with.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-09-10 08:37:01 -0500">Sep 10, 2014</time></a>

			 <p><a href="http://matthewpaulturner.com/2014/09/08/20-problems-progressive-christianity/">Matthew Paul Turner says he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;progressive Christian&rdquo;, but that he&rsquo;s never really owned the label because he&rsquo;s not entirely sure how to define it.</a> He writes an insightful piece, with a title (&ldquo;20 Problems with Progressive Christianity&rdquo;) that&rsquo;s a bit of a head fake - rather than being a list of 20 items, it&rsquo;s an essay with 20 &ldquo;problems&rdquo; identified throughout.</p>
<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t identify myself as being in the same theological place that he is, I do recognize myself in some of his self-descriptions. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A part of the bigger problem is that it’s easy for many of us <em>onetime conservatives/now progressives</em> to get caught up in our faith being defined by our past as opposed to it being inspired by what’s in front of us <strong>(&lt;-Problem number 10)</strong>. In other words, many of us know exactly what we believe to be true and untrue about the churches we grew up in, the theologies that we were taught, and the perceptions of God that we once worshiped. And there’s nothing wrong with knowing what we believe to be good and true about our pasts. But sometimes we fall onto the path of getting so lost in fighting the ills of our former spiritual lives that we go for long periods of time when that’s all our faith is, one big fight against what was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went through that period for quite a while a year or two back. It might&rsquo;ve been helpful to me for a while, but it was something I had to get beyond if I was going to move forward.</p>
<p>Turner never really gets around to defining what he means by &ldquo;progressive Christianity&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;d self-identify as a member or not. I often find myself somewhere in between, not willing to fully endorse the liberal leanings of folks like Rachel Held Evans, but also not fully embracing the conservatism of my more fundamentalist past or the neo-Calvinism to which many of my friends hold.</p>
<p>Down in the comments of Turner&rsquo;s post, Colorado pastor <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffvcook">Jeff Cook</a> <a href="http://fyre.it/O5IDvR.4">proposes a set of &ldquo;centering affirmations&rdquo; of progressive Christianity</a>, and these I could probably get behind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… We believe in a New Creation , not in an escapist soteriology. We do not embrace the Gospel as “the plan of salvation” (a gospel just about me). The Gospel is the royal announcement that Jesus Christ is Lord (a gospel about all of creation). … We have moved from speaking of ethics as simply rules to follow, to seeing the good life as a process of becoming a person fully alive in Christ and in community through the power of the Spirit. … We have moved from thinking history doesn&rsquo;t matter or that modernity is history’s zenith to seeing the past as full of wisdom to draw on. …We are aware that the Bible must be interpreted by fallible readers. … We elevate Jesus’ life, teachings, resurrection and ascension, and reject an exclusive focus on just the virginal birth and cross. All 6 are necessary to see God and his unveiling story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it this far through my post, I&rsquo;ll recommend you go over and read <a href="http://matthewpaulturner.com/2014/09/08/20-problems-progressive-christianity/">MPT&rsquo;s post</a> in its' entirety.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve finally been catching up with <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/">Richard Beck&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057Z2FT2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0057Z2FT2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=JA5O4S2ZT3R3IJUH"><em>Unclean: Meditations on Purity, Hospitality, and Mortality</em></a> and I&rsquo;m finding it fascinating. Beck is a professor of psychology at Abilene Christian University and his work usually sits at the intersection of faith topics and psychological study.</p>
<p>In <em>Unclean</em> he looks at the psychology of purity and disgust and how Christianity interacts with those built-in reactions (such as disgust) and how they shape our attitude toward sin and toward others. I&rsquo;m only about 20% of the way in so far, but this paragraph caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These dynamics [feelings leading to reasons, rather than <em>vice versa</em>] make conversations about God inherently difficult because our experience of the divine is being regulated by emotion rather than logic, affect rather than theology. I think people in churches have always known this, and felt that people in conflict within the church were generally talking past each other. One reason for this is now clear. Very often, arguments and the warrants found within them are secondary to the felt experience. Argument is offered to justify the felt judgment of the sacred or profane. And as self-justifications these arguments often fail as acts of persuasion or forms of consensus-building.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading more.</p>

			 <p>Last night I briefly moaned on Facebook about a small inconsistency that bugged me whilst watching <a href="http://westwingepguide.com/S4/Episodes/86_AM.html">The West Wing Season 4 Episode 18 (&ldquo;Angel Maintenance&rdquo;)</a>. At the end of the episode, Air Force One&rsquo;s pilot announces over the intercom that they are cleared to land on &ldquo;runway three-niner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one problem with that announcement: there&rsquo;s never any such thing as a runway 39. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway">Runways are numbered based on the compass orientation of the runway&rsquo;s direction, with the units digit lopped off.</a> For example, a runway running directly East-West would be marked &ldquo;09&rdquo; on one end and &ldquo;27&rdquo; on the other end.</p>
<p>Having thus been minimally annoyed, I followed up by checking Google Earth to determine what runways Andrews Air Force Base (the intended landing site on the show) <em>does</em> have.</p>
<p>Well, it has two of them that run roughly parallel to each other:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And when you zoom in on one end of one of them you can see it&rsquo;s marked &ldquo;01 R&rdquo;:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From this you can quite easily conclude that the other runway ends (with associated names) are &ldquo;01 L&rdquo;, &ldquo;19 R&rdquo;, and &ldquo;19 L&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="but-thats-not-all">But that&rsquo;s not all</h3>
<p><em>Aside: The plot of this episode is that AF1 is heading in from a long flight and they can&rsquo;t get a green light on the nose gear. So, the president manages crises from the air for a few hours while they turn circles over West Virginia and try to solve the problem.</em></p>
<p>I continued on Facebook to comment that there were other nits I&rsquo;d like to pick with the plot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another nit that I&rsquo;m tempted to pick at is that the press attache makes up a story that the reason they&rsquo;re not landing right away is that there&rsquo;s a fuel spill on the runway that has to get cleaned up. And a reporter asks &ldquo;don&rsquo;t they have another runway?&rdquo; and she replies that apparently it affected both of them. In point of fact, Andrews AFB has two runways that are parallel, so an incident shouldn&rsquo;t affect both of them. But given that it was a made-up story, I guess we should expect factual inaccuracies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a couple pilot friends &ldquo;like&rdquo; my comments and provide a few snarky remarks about &ldquo;artistic license&rdquo;&hellip; but then my friend Daniel chimed in.</p>
<p>Daniel is one of those people who&rsquo;s uniquely qualified to comment on a plot involving a Boeing 747: he&rsquo;s a 747 pilot. Here&rsquo;s what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hmm, the runway 39 indicates that the writers and producers made not even a token attempt at any accuracy, as even a rookie pilot would have cringed in a quick scan over the script. Just to highlight how unlikely many aviation scripts are, the B747-200 (which AF1 is, although everyone in the military insists its not, its an E-4, which is also true) only has one green light for the gear. There are ten green lights back on the flight engineer&rsquo;s panel, and the system is checked for continuity before each landing. In the event the primary (hydraulic) system does not work, any gear that cannot be lowered hydraulicly can be lowered by gravity (an extremely robust power source). This is accomplished by simply electrically removing the pin that holds the gear up, and, in the case of the nose gear, is actually faster than lowering it hydraulically (the hydraulics just slow down the nose gear when lowering). If that doesn&rsquo;t work, and there is no record of the electrical back up failing, the engineer can go down into the forward cargo bay, and use a wrench (permanently attached) to physically remove the pin. If THAT doesn&rsquo;t work, ten bolts can be removed covering the landing gear, and then the pin can be extracted. All of which, and the nose gear is not needed for a safe landing. The only use for the nose gear is to reduce the thrust needed to taxi, and facilitate steering. Ironically, there are a large number of real emergencies that can occur on large aircraft. Of course, it might take an hour or two of research to learn that&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do I have awesome friends or what?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun when somebody has a topic like this right in their wheelhouse. It reminds me of when I was in high school and my friends' dad was a submarine captain. Getting his opinions on <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>&hellip; hehehe.</p>
<p>Or when I watched an episode of <em>Human Target</em> a few years back and <a href="/10/01/sometimes-knowing-too-much-is-a-bad-thing/">ripped the whole thing apart when their plot revolved around someone reprogramming avionics software while in the air on board an airplane THAT WAS FLYING UPSIDE DOWN THE WHOLE TIME.</a></p>
<p>OK, maybe I&rsquo;m not over that one quite yet.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I have pretty awesome friends.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had a business trip last week which gave me extra reading time, so&hellip; two more knocked off the list.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060630795/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060630795&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=IWAAM3OEMD7BNPSA"><em>Merton: A Biography</em> by Monica Furlong</a>. This one underwhelmed me. The first part of the story (up to the point where Merton joins the Trappists) is told in a much more interesting fashion by Merton himself in <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em> (which I read a couple years back). The second half of the story mostly exists to make you repeatedly ask why anyone in their right mind would join the Trappists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060630795/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060630795&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=IWAAM3OEMD7BNPSA"><img src="http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0060630795&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20" alt=""></a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=chrishubbs-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060630795" alt=""></p>
<p>Second (and much more highly recommended): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061988219/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061988219&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=JLTET2F6N52KE6W3"><em>The Pastor: A Memoir</em> by Eugene Peterson</a>. Peterson is a hero among pastors to me - a man planted a church and stayed there for 30 years, who focused not on numeric growth but on spiritual growth, who made it his goal to simply consistently <em>pastor</em> (an active verb) the flock that God brought him&hellip; Peterson recounts his childhood, his call to ministry, and the lessons learned from decades of pastoring in his usual winsome way. Well worth the read.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on business travel this week to San Diego and with so many thoughts rattling around in my head, bullet points might be as good as it gets for now.</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s been a long-time West Coast - East Coast argument among my friends related to burger joints: In-N-Out vs. Five Guys. I like Five Guys, and today made my first trip to In-N-Out. It was fine, but it&rsquo;s no Five Guys.</li>
<li>I had more response on Twitter and Facebook to my burger joint comments than I&rsquo;ve had on any post for months. Apparently I have a lot of friends who have very strong opinions about burger joints.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been a burger-heavy trip; I ate at <a href="http://hodadies.com/">Hodad&rsquo;s</a> at a friend&rsquo;s recommendation on Monday night. It was also pretty tasty.</li>
<li>I love the SoCal weather but can&rsquo;t imagine living here. <em>The traffic</em>. :shudder:</li>
</ul>
<p>Some thoughts unrelated to my location this week, in decreasing levels of significance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ferguson, Missouri. So sad. So much pent-up history rearing its head the past week or two.</li>
<li>Everywhere else in the world: apparently also falling apart. Come quickly Lord Jesus.</li>
<li>I have a long post about death rattling around in my head but no time or will to write it right now.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve found precious little interesting new music this year, but the eponymous debut record by the band Colony House is a winner.</li>
<li>I won (well, shared) the &ldquo;Special K&rdquo; award in our church softball league this season: the award for the most strikeouts. I think I had two.</li>

			 <p>Pastor, author, and counselor Paul Tripp <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2014/08/02/james-macdonald-resigns-from-mars-hill-board-update-on-paul-tripps-resignation/">recently resigned from the Mars Hill Church (Seattle) Board of Advisors &amp; Accountability</a>. There was a lot of speculation at that time as to why Tripp was resigning, and in what capacity he might stick around as a consultant and counselor. Tripp cleared that up today with <a href="http://paultripp.com/articles/posts/mars-hill-boaa-statement">a statement on his website</a> wherein he describes the inadequacy of that sort of external accountability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s because of this love [for the church] that I accepted the position on Mars Hill Church&rsquo;s BoAA. But it became clear to me that <strong>a distant, external accountability board can never work well because it isn&rsquo;t a firsthand witness to the ongoing life and ministry of the church.</strong> Such a board at best can provide financial accountability, but it will find it very difficult to provide the kind of hands-on spiritual direction and protection that every Christian pastor needs. Unwittingly what happens is that the external accountability board becomes <strong>an inadequate replacement for a biblically functioning internal elder board that is the way God designed his church to be lead and pastors to be guided and protected.</strong> So, since I knew that I could not be the kind of help that I would like to be through the vehicle of the BoAA, I resigned from that position.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>I think Tripp&rsquo;s point here is key - that healthy, functional leadership comes about by having a local group of elders who can support, protect, and guide the pastor(s). There is no substitute for &ldquo;firsthand witness&rdquo; to what&rsquo;s going on at the church.</p>
<p>All of us involved in church leadership, whether pastors, elders, or other, should be reminded that mutual, humble accountability to people <em>right there within the local church</em> is the best way to stay on track.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="/12/03/some-thoughts-on-matt-chandlers-move-to-lead-acts-29/">My post from March 2012 about Matt Chandler taking over the reins of Acts 29</a> has seen some renewed activity this past week with the news that Acts 29 booted Mark Driscoll and Mars Hill Church from membership in the church planting network.</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s move is a significant one, seeing (as <a href="http://wenatcheethehatchet.blogspot.com/2014/08/in-consideration-of-recent-events-blast.html">Wenatchee the Hatchet has documented</a>) that for most of its existence, Acts 29 was, both by leadership and funding, nearly indistinguishable from Mars Hill.</p>
<p>In 2012 I had four key thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="chandler-was-a-strong-enough-personality-to-bring-about-change">Chandler was a strong enough personality to bring about change.</h3>
<p>This seems to have borne itself out; it can&rsquo;t have been easy for Chandler and company to call on Driscoll to resign, but under Chandler&rsquo;s leadership Acts 29 has done exactly that.</p>
<h3 id="chandler-could-help-change-a29-culture">Chandler could help change A29 culture</h3>
<p>Not sure that this has really happened, but I&rsquo;m hopeful that it will start to as days go by. For too long the A29 church planter model appears to have encouraged not just the Mars Hill church style but the Mark Driscoll leadership style - brash, vulgar, MMA-loving, trash-talking, in-your-face &ldquo;leadership&rdquo;. One good that could come out of Driscoll&rsquo;s current woes is for some of his acolytes to recognize the folly of emulating that persona.</p>
<h3 id="acts-29-could-start-to-get-some-distance-from-driscolls-controversies">Acts 29 could start to get some distance from Driscoll&rsquo;s controversies</h3>
<p>Well, <em>that one</em> clearly hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<h3 id="driscoll-could-have-some-room-to-rest-and-grow">Driscoll could have some room to rest and grow</h3>
<p>I was hopeful that with A29 leadership off his plate, Driscoll might have time to relax, refresh, and recharge. Perhaps I was a little bit optimistic.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on Acts 29 and Mark Driscoll, this is no time for gloating. I continue to pray that Driscoll will come to real repentance and seek reconciliation with those he has harmed, and that the Acts 29 network will be strengthened, not damaged, from Driscoll&rsquo;s ouster.</p>

			 <p>Over on CT, Ed Stetzer is starting a blog series titled &ldquo;Act Like Men&rdquo;. (First article: <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2014/august/act-like-men-what-it-means-to-fight.html">&ldquo;What It Means To Fight&rdquo;</a>). This has predictably caused a bit of feedback from the egalitarian evangelical set, with Scot McKnight posting <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/jesuscreed/2014/08/11/lynn-cohick-responds-to-stetzers-piece-on-masculinity/">a response piece from Wheaton New Testament professor Lynn Cohick</a> making the case that Paul&rsquo;s appeal to &ldquo;act like a man&rdquo; (1 Cor 16:13) was directed to both men <em>and women</em> and &ldquo;reveals the limitations of the Greek language&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;making a particular point about masculinity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m highly unqualified to comment on the Greek, but down in the comments on Stetzer&rsquo;s post is <a href="http://fyre.it/PYGACz.4">a fantastic bit from Christopher T Casberg</a>. I&rsquo;ve got no idea who Mr. Casberg is, but his comment stands on its own (emphasis all mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Marine Corps veteran. I&rsquo;ve got a sword above my bookshelf. I like rare steak, the rumble of an old Mustang, and American Ninja Warrior. I have fond memories of ramming a foam pugil stick into the belly of a much larger opponent and then knocking him senseless with a (confessedly unfair) blow to the head. <strong>I also think the ongoing debate on manhood in Christian culture is ninety percent macho nonsense</strong>. I&rsquo;m tired of hearing it. We&rsquo;ve drawn cartoonish caricature of men that resembles Tim Allen more than it resembles Christ and made that our standard. Our leaders continuously imply that their likes and hobbies (MMA fights, fishing) aren&rsquo;t personal idiosyncrasies but are what actually constitute Biblical manhood. That is ludicrous. I&rsquo;ve spoken with young believers who are worried about their manhood because they&rsquo;re not yet fathers or husbands, don&rsquo;t own a gun, don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;manly&rdquo; vocation; in other words, our young men are worried that their lives don&rsquo;t resemble a sitcom character&rsquo;s. It does not follow. We do need to ground our conversation in the Gospel, as Ed says. And we do have to allow that there&rsquo;s Stuff Guys Like and Stuff Guys Do. <strong>We endanger our mission with the Gospel, however, when we conflate the two.</strong> Being the man God intends is real simple. <strong>Do what he puts before you. Strive to do it well. Pass on what you learned. That&rsquo;s it.</strong> You don&rsquo;t have to convince yourself that everything is a fight (a word used over 20 times in this article, by the way). You don&rsquo;t have to call prayer &lsquo;battling Satan&rsquo; or worship a &lsquo;call to arms.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just prayer. Just worship. Do it, do it well, and pass it on. True manliness emerges from obedience, not the other way around. (The funny thing about Scripture is a woman would do everything Ed exhorts men to do and come out perfectly feminine. It&rsquo;s not about replicating a certain portrait of your gender. It&rsquo;s about doing what God asks you to do.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and amen.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m slowly whittling down my bedside book pile, completing Darren Dochuk&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393339041/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393339041&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20"><em>From Bible Belt to Sun Belt: Plain-Folk Religion, Grassroots Politics, and the Rise of Evangelical Conservatism</em></a> last week. This was a <strong>fantastic</strong> book. Dochuk traces the history of evangelicalism from the early days of the Depression, as evangelicals migrated west from Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and the like, to California. As a child of evangelicalism in the 80s and 90s, it was very enlightening to read about J. Vernon McGee, Billy Graham, E. V. Hill, Bill Bright, Tim LaHaye, and others. It was a bit slow going through the 1920s and 30s, but from the 1940s onward it was a wonderful, interesting read. I owe Brian Auten bigtime for recommending it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yeah, this is a nerdy post. I&rsquo;m not expecting it&rsquo;s of huge interest for my usual readers but might be helpful to others searching for more information on this configuration.</p>
<p>In my quest to use my home-built DVR to capture video that can be easily played via my Roku, I ended up purchasing a used <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/hdhomerun/">HDHomeRun Plus (HDTC-2US)</a>. (This replaced an old original-model HDHomeRun that was still working beautifully.)</p>
<p>The HDHomeRun Plus has integrated hardware to do H.264 video transcoding, so if you want to stream live TV across your network you can do it at less than full HD quality, and you can also record video at lower bit rates.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-setup">Hardware Setup</h3>
<p>This is the easy part. The HDHomeRun has three plugs on the back, and you simply plug in each of them as the QuickStart instructions show you.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The coaxial cable coming from the antenna in my attic connects to the antenna port; the ethernet jack connects to my router, and the power plug, well, you can figure that out. The power adapter is different than the original HDHomeRun (the Plus takes 12 volts; the original takes 5). A nice improvement here is that even though it&rsquo;s a dual tuner, it only requires one antenna input. The original model required splitting the antenna signal and plugging it in twice. Getting the extra cable and splitter out of the signal path improved my signal strength on a couple of channels.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also want to make sure you have the latest firmware installed. The HDHomeRun client software might do this for you automatically; if not, the firmware is rather unintuitively available on <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/linux/">the Linux Downloads page</a> of the SiliconDust website.</p>
<h3 id="software-setup">Software Setup</h3>
<p>First, assuming you&rsquo;re running Windows 7 like I am, install the Windows HDHomeRun software. This will include the configuration app and the QuickTV app. You can run the configuration app to scan for channels and watch them directly from the configuration app.</p>
<p>Then you can bring up Windows Media Center and configure it using the steps on the <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/support/instructions/hdhomerun-plus/">HDHomeRun Instructions page</a>. That should get you to the point where you can record video using the HDHomeRun and WMC.</p>
<h3 id="the-video">The Video</h3>
<p>Recording with the default HD settings, this setup will record full high-def TV signals in MPEG2 video format (using the .wtv file extension), with file sizes at about 6 GB per hour.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s a huge file and doesn&rsquo;t stream well, so I wanted the HDHomeRun to record as H.264. With the latest (June 2014) firmware update, there is the ability, using the HDHomeRun Config application, to select a default transcoding profile. Click on the HDHomeRun device in the left column of the app, and then choose the transcoding level you&rsquo;d like on the drop-down that becomes available.</p>
<p>That seemed too easy, to the point where at first it didn&rsquo;t seem like it was doing anything different. Indeed, WMC continues to record .wtv files. However, the .wtv video container now becomes a lot smaller - on the order of 1 GB / hour. It turns out that the .wtv format is just a wrapper around various formats, so if you record the transcoded video, the .wtv container holds H.264 video.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-playback-on-the-roku">Preparing for Playback on the Roku</h3>
<p>Interestingly enough, the .wtv file played pretty directly on the Roku - apparently it managed to recognize the transcoded video format. However, to get the file into the typical .mp4 format so that it can playback on various devices, one more conversion step is necessary.</p>
<p>For that step I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://mcebuddy2x.codeplex.com/">MCEBuddy 2.X</a>. MCEBuddy is pretty slick for a free app. It has the ability to sit and monitor for new recordings, convert them, rename them and move them around on the disk based on show and episode information, and do transcoding. It&rsquo;ll do serious transcoding if you need it to, but since my .wtv files are already H.264 on the inside, there&rsquo;s a transcoding profile called <strong>MP4 Unprocessed</strong>. This is a quick operation (about 10 minutes for a 1 hour program) that transforms the .wtv file into an .mp4 file. Quick and easy.</p>
<p>The end result of that process is H.264 encoded .mp4 files, all ready to stream to my Roku within 10 minutes of the recordings being completed from my over-the-air antenna. Pretty slick.</p>

<p>The question is this: <em>“If this church disappeared, would our community miss it?”</em> That’s it. If we are on mission in such a way that we are loving our neighbors and seeking their good rather than our own, it will be a cause of grief for our community if our church shuts its doors. If we’re living to build the place, pack in as many as we can, then they won’t care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rings true to me, and it&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;d love to see our churches and ministries that talk about being &ldquo;missional&rdquo; ask of themselves. It might just be a useful evaluation.</p>

			 <p>Last week we used some Amazon rewards points and a couple of gifts and upgraded our bedroom TV and bought a Roku. Our old solution, using a monitor and a Mac Mini, was OK,but was getting more and more inconvenient - Plex was great for watching recorded TV, but the Netflix plugin is broken and had to be watched through a browser, Amazon video was even harder to watch, etc, etc.</p>
<p>So now the Roku is awesome for streaming video, and the Plex app for Roku talks to our Plex Media Server (running on our HTPC) fine, but it chokes pretty hard when trying to playback the HD video files recorded off of OTA TV channels. (Basically, the HTPC doesn&rsquo;t have a high-powered CPU, and when I try to stream 6-GB/hour MPEG-encoded files to the Roku, the HTPC has to transcode the video first, and it&rsquo;s barely up to the task.</p>
<p>Next attempt: setup some transcoding software. Enter MCEBuddy. It&rsquo;s convenient enough to use, and there&rsquo;s a free version, but with a wimpy CPU transcoding from HD MPEG to H264 takes on the order of 2x realtime, meaning that it takes just over 2 hours to transcode a 1-hour show. that&rsquo;s sort of manageable here in the summer when we don&rsquo;t record too many shows, but once September hits the HTPC will be transcoding all the live-long day just to try to keep up. There&rsquo;s a paid version of MCEBuddy that I dropped $15 on with the possibility that it&rsquo;d speed things up, but my video card is old and slow enough that there&rsquo;s no hardware acceleration to help out.</p>
<p>So now what? Upgrade the video card so I can do faster transcoding? Might be a possibility, but the better solution looks like to be updating from our current HDHomeRun tuner (a 5-year-old original model) to the HDHomeRun Plus, which has H264 encoding hardware built in. Now I just need to find a spare $100 somewhere. Anybody wanna buy an (aging) Mac Mini?</p>

			 <p>The guys over on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nomadpodcast">Nomad Podcast</a> <a href="http://nomad.libsyn.com/nomad-68-krista-tippett-on-how-to-change-the-world-without-saying-a-word">recently interviewed Krista Tippett</a>, a Christian who hosts a public radio interview program called <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/about">On Being</a>. I&rsquo;ve never listened to her show before - though I may need to catch up with some episodes - but it would seem she makes a habit of interviewing people of all beliefs, of asking lots of good questions, and really actively listening to the answers.</p>
<p>So, the Nomad guys asked her, in listening to and conversing with all these other faith traditions, does she ever feel pressure to convert to one of the other faiths? I thought her answer about belief was helpful [at about 34:00]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>None of [these conversations] make me feel like I have to convert. But here&rsquo;s what I would say: the cumulative effect of all of these conversations&hellip; has instilled in me this expansive and ever-expanding sense of mystery. So my sense of mystery is quite different from when I started. And [has increased] my comfort level with that, and just really being able to take a delight in that [the sense of mystery]. So no, I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to convert, but I also think that I have less and less of a need to be able to tie everything up with a neat bow. If something doesn&rsquo;t completely make sense, or it&rsquo;s not logical, or I don&rsquo;t see how these things fit together, it doesn&rsquo;t threaten my faith, and I can leave it to the realm of mystery.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And honestly, I find that I can to back into the tradition, into Christianity, that there&rsquo;s a reverence for mystery there, for the things that we won&rsquo;t be able to explain in this lifetime, that I actually think modernity kind of neglected. It&rsquo;s really very liberating to recover that, and to take delight in it. And I actually think that a reverence for mystery - there&rsquo;s something that Einstein said, that a reverence for mystery is at the heart of the best of science and the arts and religion - I actually think that a reverence for mystery, which is an orthodox orientation, creates this beautiful space for deeply religious people to remain deeply grounded in their identities and inhabit this puzzling, amazing world full of religious others.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/07/24/music-to-work.html">Music to Work By: Rostropovich and Britten play Schubert</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/07/24/music-to-work.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-07-24 10:59:00 -0500">Jul 24, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A good bit of my day-to-day work involves reading and reviewing large documents and sets of engineering data. To help that work along, I often listen to music, but really need it to be instrumental music, since music with words can be distracting from the words I&rsquo;m reading.</p>
<p>One record I keep coming back to and so will highly recommend today is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JXZ3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000JXZ3&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=Z7MX5K43CLVJAEVF"><strong>Schubert: Sonata for Arpeggione (bowed guitar) &amp; Piano, d.821 / Schumann: 5 Pieces in the Popular Style (Volkston), Op. 102 / Debussy: Cello Sonata</strong></a> performed by cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and pianist Benjamin Britten.</p>
<p>The highlight of this record is the Schubert sonata. In three movements comprising almost 28 minutes of music, Rostropovich explores the full range of the cello, and his interplay with pianist Britten is nothing short of magical. I wasn&rsquo;t aware before listening to this recording that Britten was an accomplished pianist, but his technique and style here are exquisite, with nuances in dynamics and tempo that perfectly complement the cello.</p>
<p>Recorded in 1968 and remastered and re-released in 1999, the audio quality here is fantastic; you could quite imagine that you were sitting in the room listening to them perform. The occasional bow sound, creak of the cello, and finger sounds on the neck and while playing pizzicato are all there in the ambiance. The piano and cello are never muddy, but always sweet and distinct.</p>
<p>Highly recommended stuff.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/07/22/ragamuffin-music-inspired.html">Ragamuffin: Music inspired by the Movie</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/07/22/ragamuffin-music-inspired.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-07-22 16:11:04 -0500">Jul 22, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t watched the Ragamuffin movie yet. Having known and loved Rich Mullins for the last 20+ years exclusively based on his music, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready to have a moviemaker tell me what I should think about him as a person. But along with the movie today came out an album of music &ldquo;inspired by&rdquo; the movie - basically an album of Rich Mullins covers, with a couple old Rich demo tracks to round out the record. The artist list (including Andrew Peterson, Andy Gullahorn, and Jill Phillips, among others) pretty much guaranteed that I&rsquo;d buy it. And I did.</p>
<p>The track listing includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Creed&rdquo; - Derek Webb</li>
<li>&ldquo;If I Stand&rdquo; - Sidewalk Prophets</li>
<li>&ldquo;Calling Out Your Name&rdquo; - Andrew Peterson</li>
<li>&ldquo;I See You&rdquo; - Audrey Assad</li>
<li>&ldquo;Land of My Sojourn&rdquo; - Jars of Clay</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ready For the Storm&rdquo; - Leigh Nash</li>
<li>&ldquo;Wounds of Love&rdquo; - Mitch McVicker</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cry the Name&rdquo; - Jill Phillips</li>
<li>&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; - Andy Gullahorn</li>
<li>&ldquo;The Love of God&rdquo; - Matt Liechty</li>
</ul>
<p>Some preliminary thoughts on the songs:</p>
<p><strong>If I Stand</strong> - I&rsquo;m not familiar with Sidewalk Prophets, but their take here is a solid remake of Rich&rsquo;s original. Not much variance from the old track here; even the piano riffs remain by the book. Good vocals, though. Nothing to complain about.</p>
<p><strong>Calling Out Your Name</strong> - If you&rsquo;d told me that Andrew Peterson would be the guy on the record bringing in electronic elements, I&rsquo;d not have believed it, but here it is. He sets up a gentle electronic loop that serves as a solid base for a really nice remake of this song. Peterson&rsquo;s creativity never seems to wane.</p>
<p><strong>I See You</strong> - I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with Audrey Assad before today, but I&rsquo;m gonna have to fix that. She took a rather repetitive song here and made a beautiful track out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Land of my Sojourn</strong> - This one was a real disappointment. This is one of my favorite Rich songs, but all Jars of Clay did with it was thump a single bass note, put the guitar in an open tuning and slide around the neck from there while Dan Haseltine did a real low-key vocal. I know the JoC guys know more chords than that - wish they would&rsquo;ve used them here.</p>
<p><strong>Ready For the Storm</strong> - Rich didn&rsquo;t write this one, but Leigh Nash does a really nice job of covering the tune. Not much new here, but a solid remake. (She also skips the Picardy third in the final chord, so that wins her bonus points with me.)</p>
<p><strong>Wounds of Love</strong> - Mitch McVicker is an obvious choice to cover songs on this record, having been a good friend and collaborator of Rich&rsquo;s. This one, though, feels like he&rsquo;s trying to hard. There&rsquo;s a little bit of everything on this track - a hammered dulcimer here, a string section there, and he turns what was a low-key, heartfelt song into a more intense rock track that drags on far too long before an awkward ending. I wasn&rsquo;t sold on it.</p>
<p><strong>Cry the Name</strong> - Jill Phillips. What else can I say? This is the one track on this record where the artist took the song and really made it their own. Jill takes Rich&rsquo;s rather upbeat, 9/8 rhythm song and dials it back to a 4/4 ballad with her husband Andy Gullahorn playing guitars and singing backups. Of all the songs on the record, this is the one that sounds a lot less like Rich and a lot more like the recording artist, and that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Peace</strong> - I can&rsquo;t imagine anybody I&rsquo;d rather hear do a cover of this song than Andy Gullahorn, and he doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. He manages to replicate a lot of Rich&rsquo;s piano riffs with layered acoustic guitars, then blesses us with his calm, sure vocals on top. Pretty much exactly what you&rsquo;d expect to hear from Gullahorn, so if you&rsquo;re a fan of him, you&rsquo;ll be a fan here.</p>
<p><strong>The Love of God</strong> - I&rsquo;ve got no idea who Matt Liechty is - a quick Google search doesn&rsquo;t even turn up a proper artist homepage - but he seems far out of his depth being included with the other artists on this record. He pushes this piano ballad too hard, and his vocal chops aren&rsquo;t up to the standards otherwise present here. I love this song, but not this version of it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far you may have noted that I haven&rsquo;t said anything about Derek Webb&rsquo;s cover of Creed. Honestly, I haven&rsquo;t been much inclined to listen to anything by Derek after his recent shenanigans, so this track will probably sit unplayed for a while until I&rsquo;m ready.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a die-hard completionist, I&rsquo;d say this is a record where you could save a few bucks by just buying some selected tracks instead of the whole thing. I&rsquo;d recommend &ldquo;Calling Out Your Name&rdquo;, &ldquo;I See You&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ready for the Storm&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cry the Name&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Peace&rdquo;. Skip the others, or go back and listen to Rich&rsquo;s versions instead. Sometimes the original is best left alone. You can find it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ragamuffin-music-inspired/id898098238">on iTunes</a> today.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://glory2godforallthings.com/2014/07/07/the-struggle-to-be-real/">a good piece today from Fr. Stephen Freeman</a> revisiting C. S. Lewis and JRR Tolkien&rsquo;s exploration of myth - not myth in the popular sense of &ldquo;a story that isn&rsquo;t true&rdquo;, but in the sense of a &ldquo;primal, shaping story&rdquo; that is &ldquo;profoundly and deeply true&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tolkien, reflecting on [fellow Inkling Owen] Barfields’s work, said, “If God is mythopoetic, then we must become mythopathic.” This is to say that if God’s primary mode of revelation is through the instrument of mythic stories and events, then we ourselves must be open to understanding such mythic expressions of realities. Strangely, myth (in their use of the term) is far better suited to expressing Realism than any possible materialist account. And this brings us to my original point: Why do the imaginative works of Lewis and Tolkien speak to the modern heart as much as they do? They do so because they are true! But the truth that they relate is a truth known primarily by the heart and it is this dynamic that gives myth both its nature and its effectiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fr. Stephen goes on to say that the Christian liturgy (Fr. Stephen is Orthodox, for whom the liturgy is significant and ornate) is a way of including that deep, primal, indescribable truth into our worship of God. And while I&rsquo;m not really tempted to move to Eastern Orthodoxy, I do think it&rsquo;s something that us cerebral evangelicals would do good to consider from time to time.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been shaped by the Enlightenment to systematize and study and intellectualize our faith, which is all well and good. But we should also not be afraid of the primal truths of the universe that God created, even if we can&rsquo;t always find words to express it. Lewis described in Narnia a &ldquo;deep magic from before the dawn of time&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s revel in the God who created it, both with our intellects and with our primal souls.</p>

			 <p>Just a few random observations&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Crazy softball game in our church league last night. We were behind 3-0 most of the night, then with two outs in the bottom of the 5th inning we scored 13 runs to invoke the mercy rule. Wild.</li>
<li>I finally got my iPhone back from Apple after I sent it in to get the lock button replaced. Or at least I got <em>an</em> iPhone back. I didn&rsquo;t record serial numbers, but the device ID reported by my work&rsquo;s network is different, and it&rsquo;s missing the little scratch on the screen. I&rsquo;m not complaining - it&rsquo;s basically a like-new iPhone 5, 18 months after I originally purchased it.</li>
<li>Curious what the iPhone 6 will turn out to be and whether it&rsquo;ll be enough to tempt me into an upgrade. If they have a larger device and I can get a decent price for my old iPhone, that might be enough&hellip; otherwise I can always wait for the inevitable iPhone 6S.</li>
<li>I thought I lost my Fitbit somewhere going through security on the way home from my business trip last week. Was thinking it&rsquo;d be a good excuse to need to check out the next round of wearable devices undoubtedly coming out this fall. Ends up I found it this morning in an obscure corner of my backpack. Oh well.</li>
<li>Looking forward to meeting another &ldquo;internet friend&rdquo; in person tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve met a couple dozen folks over the past decade who started out as &ldquo;internet friends&rdquo;, and they&rsquo;ve been pretty consistently awesome. I have no doubt this next one will be, too.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m feeling really tired this morning. I have a few vacation days scheduled over the next couple weeks, which should help. I need to schedule a few more. Things just don&rsquo;t slow down.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently started listening to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/mere-fidelity/id885758537?mt=2">Mere Fidelity podcast</a>, a theological conversation between Americans <a href="https://twitter.com/DZRishmawy">Derek Rishmawy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattleeanderson">Matthew Lee Anderson</a>, and Brits <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zugzwanged">Alistair Roberts</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AJWTheology">Andrew Wilson</a>. On <a href="http://mereorthodoxy.com/mere-fidelity-surprised-nt-wright/">a recent episode</a> they took up the topic of Anglican theologian NT Wright.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s no secret to any readers of this blog that I&rsquo;m a huge NT Wright fan; I have given away more copies of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061551821/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0061551821&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=WCORIRYCHFSZYZ2D"><em>Surprised By Hope</em></a> to friends than any other volume, heard him in person once, and in general point to him as one of the most influential authors in my theological development over the past decade. I&rsquo;ve read most of his recent popular-level books, and the first three of his Christian Origins series. (His two-volume fourth part of that series is sitting in my to-read pile.)</p>
<p>All the participants on the podcast expressed a great deal of admiration and appreciation for Wright before launching into their criticisms, but it was the criticisms that had me wanting to shout &ldquo;but&hellip; but&hellip;&rdquo; at my phone as I listened. I think much of my disagreement with them may be explained by my American layman&rsquo;s perspective, and indeed they may have provided enough caveats through the podcast that we&rsquo;re likely not in great disagreement, but I want to trace their thoughts and my responses here if only to benefit my own thinking.</p>
<h3 id="wrights-characterization-caricature-of-evangelicalism">Wright&rsquo;s Characterization (Caricature?) of Evangelicalism</h3>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;m going to bang heads with the MF guys (and probably mostly Anderson) the most. At one point he says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;in Surprised by hope] he [Wright] has a narrative about evangelicalism that&rsquo;s largely de-historicized. That rips even hymn verses out of their context and uses them to show all of these problems within the evangelical milieu. And he says lots of true things in doing so, but he creates such a caricature of the mentality that he&rsquo;s disagreeing with along the way that I think it&rsquo;s really unfortunate. [at 13:20 or so in the podcast]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only reason anyone should ever by &lsquo;surprised by hope&rsquo; in this world is if they ignored Augustine, ignored Calvin, ignored Aquinas, ignored Luther, ignored everyone who has been saying &lsquo;new creation&rsquo; and &lsquo;resurrected bodies&rsquo; for the past two thousand years. [at 20:45]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, I suppose, the evangelical academic&rsquo;s caricature is the layman&rsquo;s sense of reality. I would respond to Anderson here that for every historic evangelical who would largely align with Wright, thus making Wright&rsquo;s claims a caricature, that there is likely a current evangelical who would not, or at least who knows little on the subject, thus making the &ldquo;caricature&rdquo; something much closer to reality.</p>
<p>At the sampling of evangelical churches I&rsquo;ve belonged to in my 37 years (including Baptist, Bible, Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance, and Evangelical Free), never once have I heard a full-bodied story of resurrection taught in the way Wright proclaims it. Most often the eschatology isn&rsquo;t taught at all, or it&rsquo;s lightly glossed over - certainly never brought in a way that emphasizes (as Wright does) how that understanding of the Kingdom impacts how we live in the here and now. My conversations with fellow church members anecdotally indicate that the <em>Left Behind</em> series continues to more significantly influence the common evangelical layman&rsquo;s view of end times than anything else. (Maybe the upcoming Nic Cage <em>remake</em> of the Left Behind movie will change that? Nah.)</p>
<p>As to the specific point about ripping lines of hymns out of context, I&rsquo;ll say just two things. First: that the hymns he calls out are some which I have grown up loving dearly, which makes Wright&rsquo;s criticism a bit painful; second: That this bit of the book will fall flat with American evangelicals within the next 10 years or so since most of us are singing only modern praise songs now, the content of which typically struggles to be correct theologically about even the basics of the faith, and which almost never addresses eschatology.</p>
<p>Anderson doesn&rsquo;t let it go, though. Later on he argued that Billy Graham&rsquo;s view of resurrection and heaven isn&rsquo;t really that different from Wright&rsquo;s, if you know the code words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For all the good that he [Wright] is doing, the straw man has brought an unnecessary antithesis and hostility towards the older ways of framing things that doesn&rsquo;t realize that evangelicals have shorthand, and a whole cluster of concepts behind that shorthand, and it&rsquo;s not all as bad as NT Wright presents it as being in his lay-level work. [at 22:50]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of thoughts here: first, I wouldn&rsquo;t assume that Wright &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t realize&rdquo; that evangelicals have this shorthand. I would assume it is familiar to him and most all scholars who have even a passing familiarity with the history of evangelical thought. <strong>However</strong>, <em>Surprised By Hope</em> is a popular work, and at the popular level I think there are many, many evangelicals who aren&rsquo;t familiar with this shorthand.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rishmawy chimed in on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You and I know that&rsquo;s shorthand&hellip; [but] I think there are times when the shorthand has gotten lost in pop evangelicalism or pop fundamentalism or whatever, where people hear this and are, like, &lsquo;this is totally new&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re right, my pastor has kind of sounded like that. The best of the tradition has never lost sight of this. [at 23:20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what bits of evangelical tradition Derek deems &ldquo;the best&rdquo;, but his comments about that shorthand being lost in pop evangelicalism are, in my experience, right on. When I heard Wright speak in Nashville a couple years ago he noted that, as a surprise to him, he&rsquo;d developed &lsquo;something of a side ministry&rsquo; helping American evangelicals find their way out of the <em>Left Behind</em> sort of theological mess. I&rsquo;m one of those, and grateful for it.</p>
<p>At another point in the discussion, Roberts, in making an (apparently obligatory on Mere Fidelity) Oliver O&rsquo;Donavan reference brought up a point that I very much appreciated - that American fanboys of Wright, in feeling that Wright is some sort of Pied Piper (no, not <em>that</em> Piper) leading them out of evangelicalism, would not be feeling their current disillusionment with Wright on social issues if they understood his theology more fully. To wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Oliver O&rsquo;Donavan in a conference in dialog with NT Wright that I attended - he made the point that Wright always makes these hyperbolic statements that seem to be anti-traditionalist in order to cover up just how traditionalist he actually is, how conservative his position is, because otherwise people wouldn&rsquo;t realize how firmly in continuity it is with Reformed evangelical tradition. [at 19:20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has actually led me to appreciate Wright even a bit more lately than I had before, because I find myself having pushed pretty hard against evangelicalism the past several years, only to consistently find that while I am often sympathetic with the plight of some of my more progressive brethren, I can&rsquo;t fully get on board with them when it comes to much of their social progressivism. It&rsquo;s encouraging to have someone like Wright seemingly closer to that middle ground where I often find myself.</p>
<p>To the esteemed gents on Mere Fidelity - first, thanks for the great conversation. Yours has quickly become a favorite podcast of mine. But I&rsquo;d urge you, in the midst of your theological erudition, to not so quickly pooh-pooh Wright&rsquo;s pop characterization of evangelicalism. By many accounts he is speaking evangelical truth at a level that is reaching many who may never delve into Augustine, Calvin, Aquinas, or Luther. And for that we should be thankful.</p>
<p><em>The Mere Fidelity guys are promising a second discussion on Wright to discuss the Reformed folks' issues with his theology. I&rsquo;ll listen with interest but, not being Reformed myself, without much of a dog in the fight.</em></p>

			 <p>American Airlines and a stalled warm front have conspired to have me sleeping overnight in the Chicago O&rsquo;Hare airport to catch a flight home first thing in the morning. So what&rsquo;s a guy to do? Live blog, why not? Here&rsquo;s the offending weather picture.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A traditional Liveblog would add posts at the top, but I&rsquo;m lazy and like to see things in chronological order, so I&rsquo;ll update at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 pm</strong> Eating dinner at the Chili&rsquo;s in the atrium of the airport. It&rsquo;s pretty busy for this time of night. The bar is full, undoubtedly with folks who know that they&rsquo;re gonna be here a while. The gate agent told me they set up a bunch of cots over by gate K1 to handle scenarios just like this. I&rsquo;ll be grabbing one of those before it gets too late. First to get my check and then go find a power outlet. This phone battery won&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p><strong>9:04 pm</strong> Some serious lightning outside and rain coming down pretty good. The airport folks have probably 150 cots (complete with airplane pillows and blankets) set up already and have carts full of more cots ready to go.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s the stack still waiting to be set up.</p>
<p>Wandered down a ways and found a lonely cot right next to a functioning power outlet. Score!</p>
<p><strong>9:16 pm</strong> Time to watch a movie before sleeping. Fortunately I have a fully stocked iPad for just such an occasion. Tonight&rsquo;s feature: <em>Drinking Buddies</em>. With Olivia Wilde and Ron Livingston it can&rsquo;t be too awful, right?</p>
<p><strong>9:50 pm</strong> Sharing my power outlet for a while with a gal who has a thick southern accent and an iPhone 4 with a dead battery. The cots are filling up here by gate K1.</p>
<p><strong>10:51 pm</strong> Movie over. I liked it. Revolutionary idea that a guy and a girl could be friends and not immediately head to the sack. There&rsquo;s no way though that Olivia Wilde&rsquo;s character could drink that much beer every day and stay that skinny.</p>
<p>Cots full of people off in both ways down the concourse. And people still heading past us to make late-night west coast connections.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Made a quick trip to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, switched to glasses. Time to try to get some sleep.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There was a second cot down by my feet when I claimed this one; a few minutes later somebody grabbed it and moved it further down the concourse. 30 minutes later the airport folks set another one up in its place. And 2 minutes ago somebody took it, too, to some other location. Maybe I&rsquo;m scary looking. Of course maybe nobody just wants to sleep next to my feet. I can&rsquo;t blame them.</p>
<p><strong>11:15 pm</strong> I am 6-foot-4 inches long. This cot is decidedly not. Yawning a lot but there are lots of lights still on and it&rsquo;s noisy. Wonder how long that&rsquo;ll persist?</p>
<p><strong>11:25 pm</strong> All my yawns feel unfulfilling somehow. Still really bright. Breaking out my Cubs hat to lay over my face in hopes it&rsquo;ll help me get to sleep and give me a little local cred.</p>
<p>The hat smells almost as bad as my feet.</p>
<p><strong>11:38 pm</strong> Not having much luck sleeping. It is quieting down some now, though. Created a Foursquare location. Hope other people will use it!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>12:05 am</strong> No luck sleeping so far. Can&rsquo;t even seem to get that good yawn in. It has quieted down quite a bit in here after midnight; all the automated announcements are turned off, as are some of the overhead lights.</p>
<p>Some lucky folks are sleeping - the guy next to me is sawing logs - but many are laying restlessly awake on their cots just like I am. Starbucks will be doing brisk business in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>12:52 am</strong> Still no luck sleeping. Think I&rsquo;d have better luck on the floor than on this cot - it&rsquo;s just too small. I think I&rsquo;ll go wander around. I wonder if I can find a piano&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>1:08 am</strong> Ok, once I got up and walked past all the cots I realized I severely underestimated how many there are. At least 350 now stretched out, all full. And flights still arriving and departing. (I feel sorry for the folks whose flight to Charlotte is now departing at 3:18.)</p>
<p>Lots of people up, wandering around, getting McDonald&rsquo;s, sitting talking. Guess it never sleeps here.</p>
<p><strong>2:38 am</strong></p>
<p>Spent the last hour playing a piano I found in the concourse wine bar. Had security come by, identify an unattended bag, then stand around and chat for 15 minutes while waiting for the police to come pick it up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The security guy told me that his 17-year-old son was shot 3 times last Friday in a drive-by shooting and is still in the hospital. Meanwhile, dad works the graveyard shift at O&rsquo;Hare and worries about his son. Taking a minute to pray for the dad and the kid.</p>
<p>The terminal is getting quieter now. There were a few flights still coming in during the 1:00 hour, but now things have turned over and the new folks are coming in for the morning shift. The security guy chatted up a 50-something Polish baggage handler who has his folks living with him, walks with a limp, but has been doing the job day in and day out for 15 years. It&rsquo;s a sobering reminder to me, miffed that I missed my flight home to the suburbs, that there are folks getting paid a lot less who do a lot harder jobs at worse hours. I have much to be thankful for.</p>
<p><strong>3:21 am</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m parked in the food court at a table next to a plugin. There are three 24-hour shops open: Starbucks, McDonald&rsquo;s, and Dunkin Donuts. And they&rsquo;re all staying fairly busy.</p>
<p>There are a dozen or so people sitting up here in the food court, most working on laptops, one writing longhand on a legal pad.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly through my venti Americano and watching Leo DiCaprio playing J. Edgar Hoover. So far so good. By the time it finishes up the sun should be rising and my flight will be only a couple hours away.</p>
<p><strong>4:21 am</strong> The morning crowd is starting to show up and the food court is starting to smell good as the breakfast sandwiches start cooking. I suppose there are 5 am departures that people are showing up for, and they seem remarkably perky.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in line to grab a Dunkin donuts breakfast and then to walk over to my gate. Three hours until departure.</p>
<p>I replied to some work email over the last hour, too, including a note telling my boss I wasn&rsquo;t planning on coming in on Friday. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll object.</p>
<p><strong>4:43 am</strong> At my gate. The status board still says those two blessed words: &ldquo;On Time&rdquo;. Put on my one remaining clean shirt just to make it feel like a new day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here goes nothin'!</p>
<p><strong>5:44 am</strong></p>
<p>Kudos to American Airlines for having gate agents out in force this morning. They knew they were gonna have lots of people to deal with and they appear at least reasonably equipped to handle it. Very glad I got a seat assigned and a boarding pass last night so I&rsquo;m not standing in one of those lines, though.</p>
<p>Bought a real newspaper for the first time in years just to give me something light to read. The Chicago Tribune is up to $1.50 for the daily but feels thick enough that it might be worth it.</p>
<p><strong>7:06 am</strong></p>
<p>Boarding the plane. Thus endeth the Liveblog.</p>

			 <p>As a follow-up to <a href="/14/06/take-down-that-post/">my last post</a>: Leadership Journal last night took down the controversial post, <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/le/2014/june-online-only/my-easy-trip-from-youth-minister-to-felon.html?allcomments=true&amp;showall=true">replacing it with this note</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A note from the editors of Leadership Journal: We should not have published this post, and we deeply regret the decision to do so. The post, told from the perspective of a sex offender, withheld from readers until the very end a crucial piece of information: that the sexual misconduct being described involved a minor under the youth pastor&rsquo;s care. Among other failings, this post used language that implied consent and mutuality when in fact there can be no question that in situations of such disproportionate power there is no such thing as consent or mutuality.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The post, intended to dissuade future perpetrators, dwelt at length on the losses this criminal sin caused the author, while displaying little or no empathic engagement with the far greater losses caused to the victim of the crime and the wider community around the author. The post adopted a tone that was not appropriate given its failure to document complete repentance and restoration. There is no way to remove the piece altogether from the Internet, and we do not want to make it seem that we are trying to make it disappear. That is not journalistically honest. The fact that we published it; its deficiencies; and the way its deficiencies illuminate our own lack of insight and foresight, is a matter of record at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613190102/http://christianitytoday.com/le/2014/june-online-only/my-easy-trip-from-youth-minister-to-felon.html">The Internet Archive</a>. Any advertising revenues derived from hits to this post will be donated to Christian organizations that work with survivors of sexual abuse. We will be working to regain our readers' trust and to give greater voice to victims of abuse. We apologize unreservedly for the hurt we clearly have caused.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>I offer my thanks to the editors for making this decision, and encourage them to examine the processes that led them to publish it in the first place, in hopes that they won&rsquo;t make a similar decision next time.</p>

			 <p>As if it had been too long since the last evangelical church sex abuse scandal, Leadership Journal (an imprint of Christianity Today) posted a long online article this month titled <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/le/2014/june-online-only/my-easy-trip-from-youth-minister-to-felon.html?allcomments=true&amp;showall=true">&ldquo;My Easy Trip from Youth Minister to Felon&rdquo;</a>. Tagged as an article on topics including &ldquo;adultery&rdquo;, &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, &ldquo;sex&rdquo;, and &ldquo;temptation&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a long-ish first-person account of a youth pastor describing his progression into what sounds like an extramarital affair. Then on the last page you find out the &ldquo;other woman&rdquo; in question was a teenager in his church. Suddenly a cautionary tale about temptation turns out to be a story about a pastor grooming and abusing an underaged girl in his congregation. Disgusting.</p>
<p>My intent here isn&rsquo;t to provide a full summary or address the article - <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/06/13/ex-youth-pastor-describes-felony-sex-crimes-as-extramarital-friendship-in-christian-journal/">RawStory.com reported on it</a> and <a href="http://redemptionpictures.com/2014/06/13/my-innocence-was-stolen/?utm_content=buffer839ec&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">many</a> <a href="http://defeatingthedragons.wordpress.com/2014/06/12/leadership-journal-christianity-today-and-takedownthatpost/">Christian</a> <a href="http://www.elizabethesther.com/2014/06/an-open-letter-to-christianity-today-take-down-the-rape-post-its-not-an-extramarital-relationship-its-rape-ctmagazine.html">bloggers</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2014/06/christianity-todays-good-man-project-moment.html">have</a> <a href="http://hopefullyknown.com/2014/06/12/because-its-time-to-take-down-that-post/">chimed</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/06/12/why-did-a-journal-for-christian-pastors-give-a-platform-to-a-sexual-predator/#ixzz34TCeBGpg">in</a>. The Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23takedownthatpost&amp;src=typd">#TakeDownThatPost</a> quickly sprang up, and I found myself sympathetic.</p>
<p>But then my friend Randy chimed in with a slightly different approach. And that led me to a different, more interesting question. Rather than calling for the editors of the publication to reconsider and take down the post, might it be more appropriate to simply raise awareness that the publication has chosen to post such content, and then let people form their own opinions of the publication and its editors?</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a conundrum.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-right-approach">What&rsquo;s the right approach?</h3>
<p>Because on one hand Randy&rsquo;s proposed approach seems pretty attractive. It allows me to just state the facts. If anything, the factual headline (RawStory.com: &ldquo;Ex-Youth Pastor describes felony sex crimes as extramarital friendship in Christian Journal&rdquo;) draws far more attention than a &ldquo;#TakeDownThatPost&rdquo; hashtag. And let&rsquo;s face it, if some organization with which I didn&rsquo;t expect to align did something like this I wouldn&rsquo;t be campaigning for them to self-censor - I&rsquo;d just point out where I thought they went wrong and leave it at that.</p>
<p>But this is <em>Christianity Today</em> we&rsquo;re talking about. I typically respect them quite a bit. Only two weeks ago <a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2014/05/29/real-transformation-happens-when/">I recommended their editor Mark Galli&rsquo;s recent piece on sanctification</a>. Their executive editor Andy Crouch wrote one of my favorite books from last year. I&rsquo;d like to think there&rsquo;s some <em>restorative</em> action I could encourage rather than just throwing them under the bus. And to simply draw attention to their unwise action and let others draw conclusions seems an awful lot like I&rsquo;m trying to drag Christians' names through the mud, which also doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good idea.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-cant-say-something-nice">If you can&rsquo;t say something nice&hellip;</h3>
<p>I suppose there&rsquo;s another option: just don&rsquo;t say anything. It&rsquo;s not like the world is looking to me for comment on every issue, right? I was starting to feel that way and then I saw the story going around Facebook and local friends personally looking into it. Now I feel some amount of compulsion to comment, if only to let them know that they&rsquo;re not alone in being upset about CT posting this article.</p>
<h3 id="so-where-does-that-leave-me">So where does that leave me?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a CT subscriber, so I can&rsquo;t vote with my feet by cancelling a subscription. I sent an email to the editor of Leadership Journal this morning expressing my concern. I don&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of value in actively joining the Twitter crowd and propagating the hashtag. So what else do I do? (Do I need to do anything?) Pray for the situation, sure - for the victim, the jailed man, the countless other victims out there. But other than that I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s much to do, or much more to say that others aren&rsquo;t saying more eloquently than I would.</p>
<p>If the abuse scandals of the Catholic church, Sovereign Grace Ministries, Bill Gothard, Vision Forum, and others haven&rsquo;t yet made it clear enough to us in the evangelical church: covering up, weasling around the topic, addressing it as only sin/repentance and not as a crime, characterizing pastor/youth sex as &lsquo;relationships&rsquo; rather than predation - this has got to stop. Let&rsquo;s not bring even more disrepute to the church than the abusers already have. Let&rsquo;s again call our elders to be above reproach, and hold them to it.</p>
<p>While we may all personally want to shy away from casting the first stone, God is not mocked. As a church body it&rsquo;s well past time that we find the pile of millstones and remind ourselves how Jesus advised they might be used.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was fascinated to last week stumble upon the results of <a href="http://go.efca.org/resources/document/efca-doctrinal-survey">a 2013 doctrinal survey of more than 1000 credentialed Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) pastors</a>. I&rsquo;ve been a member of an EFCA church for just more than 5 years, and while I have a reasonable feel for where my own congregation stands on many doctrinal issues, it&rsquo;s very interesting to get a feel for where the denomination is as a greater whole.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts-on-various-survey-topics">Some thoughts on various survey topics:</h2>
<h3 id="creation--evolution">Creation / Evolution</h3>
<p><strong>Q8: &ldquo;Which of these best characterizes your view on the creation account in Genesis 1?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I was a little bit surprised that almost 60% of respondents held the &ldquo;six literal days&rdquo; view. (I would&rsquo;ve expected that view to be predominant, but maybe not quite so high.) Another 20% opted for some older-earth view, with the remaining 20% responding &lsquo;unsettled&rsquo; or &lsquo;other&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The results of Q9, then, come as no surprise: <strong>&ldquo;How important is your view of the age of the earth to your theological framework?&quot;</strong> 65% answered either very or somewhat important. My guess is that the overlap between the &ldquo;six literal days&rdquo; folks and the very or somewhat important folks is very great, and that they also largely overlap with the 57% who either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the Q10 proposition that <strong>&ldquo;some forms of theistic evolution are compatible with biblical teaching&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="science">Science</h3>
<p>I was very disappointed with the wording of Q13; its wording seems to bias the respondent toward a specific answer. <strong>&ldquo;The Bible is not authoritative in matters in which it touches on history or science.&quot;</strong> More than 90% of responses disagreed with this statement.</p>
<p>Surely the phrase &ldquo;not authoritative&rdquo; set off immediate red flags for most survey-takers. If the EFCA leadership was trying to ascertain the view of their pastors in regard to issues of science and history as addressed, say, in Peter Enns' recent <em>Inspiration and Incarnation</em>, they could&rsquo;ve worded the question more neutrally.</p>
<h3 id="eternal-subordination-of-the-son">Eternal Subordination of the Son</h3>
<p>This topic, on its own, is perhaps more esoteric than most on the survey; we don&rsquo;t typically argue it as an individual doctrine. Where we <em>do</em> see its impact, though, is in the subordination / complementarian view of men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s roles in the church. Nearly 70% of all respondents agreed with the Q11 statement that <strong>&ldquo;The Son is eternally subordinate to the Father in the eternal relations in the Trinity.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I did a little additional reading for my own benefit and quickly ran across a <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/octoberweb-only/141-53.0.html">summary of a debate on this topic</a> held at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (which is associated with the EFCA) back in 2008. Interestingly enough, a professor of systematic theology at Trinity was arguing <em>against</em> the eternal subordination position in that debate. Former Trinity professors Wayne Grudem and Bruce Ware argued the affirmative side. My guess is that the immense popularity of Grudem&rsquo;s <em>Systematic Theology</em> has helped bring about this majority on the side of eternal subordination.</p>
<p>Aligning with this was the 85% affirming the complementarian position on the topic of women in ministry (Q21).</p>
<h3 id="the-bible">The Bible</h3>
<p>The answer to Q20 interests me a bit, if only because it runs very contrary to a lot of the Reformed blog chatter from the past several months. <strong>&ldquo;Should we expect to hear the Spirit speak to us apart from illuminating our understanding and application of the Scripture?&quot;</strong> 60% said yes.</p>
<h3 id="eschatology">Eschatology</h3>
<p>This one is curious to me. Q35 asked <strong>&ldquo;What would best desrcibe your eschatological position?&quot;</strong>, and the four options were three varieties of premillennial and then &ldquo;other&rdquo;. 84% of respondents went with some sort of pre-mil position, and 75% of respondents said that premillennialism is somewhat or very important in their theological framework (Q36). <em>However</em>, when asked whether &ldquo;premillennialism&rdquo; should be retained in a future revision to the EFCA statement of faith, the response was nearly 50/50, with a slim majority (45%) actually saying it should <strong>not</strong> be retained.</p>
<h3 id="topics-that-didnt-surprise-me-so-much">Topics that didn&rsquo;t surprise me so much:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Penal Substitutionary Atonement (95% agree it is an &ldquo;essential understanding&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Eternal security of the believer (94% agree)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Open but cautious&rdquo; approach to the miraculous gifts (71%)</li>
<li>Church membership is important (95%)</li>
<li>Church leadership via corporate congregational discernment, led largely by a team of pastor/elders. (88%)</li>
<li>Compassion and justice are not the gospel but a necessary outworking of it (70%)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Eternal conscious punishment&rdquo; - very important (80%)</li>
<li>Divorce/remarriage acceptable in cases of infidelity or desertion (93% affirm this or a more open position)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-significance-of-silence">The Significance of Silence</h2>
<p>Question 45 asked whether or not the EFCA commitment to live and minister within the &ldquo;significance of silence&rdquo; framework is a strength. 94% of respondents agreed that it was. I have some more thoughts about this &ldquo;significance of silence&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ll save for a future post.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>On the whole, I was very encouraged to see the broad responses from my denomination, and I think they line up pretty well with the positions of our local congregation. I&rsquo;m encouraged by what I see here, and look forward, as the Lord wills, to many more years of being a part of this church.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <a href="http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2014/06/03/nt-wright-homosexuality-science-gender/">a recent interview by Jonathan Merritt on Religion News Service</a>, Anglican bishop NT Wright had this to say about the Bible and how we work out ethics and doctrine (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;<strong>it’s important that we do not reduce the Bible to a collection of true doctrines and right ethics</strong>. There are plenty of true doctrines and right ethics there, of course, but <strong>they come within the larger thing, which is the story of how the Creator is rescuing and restoring the whole creation</strong>, with his rescue and restoration of humans at the heart of it. In other words, it isn’t about “do we allow this or that?” To ask the question that way is already to admit defeat, to think in terms of behavior as a set of quasi-arbitrary, and hence negotiable, rules. We must ask, with Paul, “This new creation God has launched in Jesus—what does it look like, and how can we live well as genuine humans, as both a sign and a means of that renewal?” <strong>We need to remind ourselves that the entire biblical sexual ethic is deeply counter-intuitive.</strong> All human beings some of the time, and some human beings most of the time, have deep heartfelt longings for kinds of sexual intimacy or gratification (multiple partners, pornography, whatever) which do not reflect the creator’s best intentions for his human creatures, intentions through which new wisdom and flourishing will come to birth. <strong>Sexual restraint is mandatory for all, difficult for most, extremely challenging for some. God is gracious and merciful but this never means “so his creational standards don’t really matter after all.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such good perspective. I didn&rsquo;t realize until reading this interview that Wright has a new book out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062230530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062230530&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=D2HZMD2PGMJOWKFX"><em>Surprised by Scripture: Engaging Contemporary Issues</em></a>. Another one to add to my reading pile!</p>

<p>But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.

</blockquote>
<p>I promised myself and my readers not too long ago that my theo-rage-blogging days are over. Which means I&rsquo;ve wrestled with myself now about whether or not to write this post. I&rsquo;ve come down on the side, though, of writing it, because I think there&rsquo;s something here to say that isn&rsquo;t tied to any group or denomination or particular theological persuasion. So here goes.</p>
<p>This is the cover of the latest issue of Time magazine. It features Laverne Cox, a transgender actress best known for starring in the Netflix series &ldquo;Orange is the New Black&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/39adf0bb50.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Transgender Tipping Point&rdquo;, it declares. &ldquo;America&rsquo;s next civil rights frontier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a subscriber to Time, and haven&rsquo;t been past a newsstand lately, so my first awareness of this cover came from a <a href="https://twitter.com/drmoore/status/472105205211750400">(re)tweet by Russell Moore (@drmoore)</a> that looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/drmoore/status/472105205211750400">https://twitter.com/drmoore/status/472105205211750400</a></p>
<p>Dr. Moore is President of the Southern Baptist Convention&rsquo;s Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, and a not-infrequent commentator on social and political topics. I don&rsquo;t mean to call him out personally here; his attitude and commentary are likely no different than what I&rsquo;d hear from many other corners of the evangelical church.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m bothered by the approach. &ldquo;Are you prepared for what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; implies a significant level of us-against-them, fight-the-culture-war-to-win-it mentality that disrespects transgender people and doesn&rsquo;t seem to recognize that they are cherished divine image-bearers just as much as we are.</p>
<p>I thought I was reading a little too much into it - afraid of my own biases, as it were - but then I read the stream of replies to Moore&rsquo;s tweet. Those replies are even more disturbing. Referring to the actress as &ldquo;it&rdquo;, as a &ldquo;fake &lsquo;woman&rsquo;&rdquo;. Expressions of disgust (&quot;&hellip;permanently lost my appetite.&quot;, &ldquo;want to go into a bubble&rdquo;). When one person refers to the actress as &ldquo;her&rdquo;, another one replies to &lsquo;correct&rsquo; the first with &ldquo;*his&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To his credit, Dr. Moore&rsquo;s follow-up tweet linked to <a href="http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2013/08/15/conservative-christianity-and-the-transgender-question/10610">a more nuanced position</a> on &lsquo;the transgender issue&rsquo;, as he puts it, which includes the declaration that &ldquo;As conservative Christians, we do not see transgendered persons as “freaks” to be despised or ridiculed.&rdquo; Later on he says that &ldquo;&hellip;this also means that we will love and be patient with those who feel alienated from their created identities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One hopes that, on reflection, Dr. Moore and the folks who replied to him might recognize that those tweets have every likelihood of being interpreted as alienating and despising rather than loving and patient.</p>
<p><strong>As Christians, we must do better.</strong></p>
<p>In the verse I quoted at the top of this post, the Apostle Peter says that our testimonies of faith must be given with &ldquo;gentleness and respect&rdquo;, so that any accusations of bad behavior will be undeserved and slanderous.</p>
<p>I will be the first to admit that I don&rsquo;t have a fully-formed theological position when it comes to transgender issues. This is a topic that will no doubt soon get fuller treatment in the theological world much as homosexuality has over the past decade.</p>
<p>But I do know this: as Christians we should cultivate an approach and reaction to <strong>all people</strong> that starts with love, care, and concern, not one of disgust and alienation. If we can&rsquo;t even respect a person enough to address them by their preferred gender, how can we ever hope that they&rsquo;ll listen to us long enough that we can tell them about God&rsquo;s love for them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to lose the culture war!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, we are. We probably already have. We&rsquo;re not called to win it. We&rsquo;re called to be faithful. The Apostle Peter wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;winning the culture war&rsquo; in his day, either. Which might be why he followed up the call to gentleness and respect with these words: &ldquo;For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May that be the legacy of Christians in this place and time.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/05/29/real-transformation-happens.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-05-29 16:49:10 -0500">May 29, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In light of the whole Tullian Tchividjian / Gospel Coalition dust-up in recent days, Mark Galli has an interesting piece at Christianity Today online titled <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/may-web-only/real-transformation-happens-when.html">&ldquo;Real Transformation Happens When?&quot;</a>. Galli&rsquo;s thesis will make you do a double-take:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to raise one sanctification issue that I don&rsquo;t see discussed much. I do not doubt the biblical call to holy living (1 Pet. 1:15 being the quintessential text). But after living the Christian life for nearly a half century, <strong>I doubt the ability of Christians to make much progress in holiness</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the what?</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t stop there, keep reading.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look at my own life and marvel at the lack of real transformation after 50 years of effort. To be sure, outwardly I&rsquo;m more patient, kind, gracious, and so forth. But even after half a century of transformation, my thoughts and motives are a cauldron of evil. Just one small example: When a friend fails to show up on time, I&rsquo;m outwardly patient and kind, but inwardly I battle judgment and condemnation. Earlier in life, I would have lashed out at him for being tardy, as lack of respect for me among other things. Now I have some self-control as I smile and say, &ldquo;Not a problem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Galli goes on to recognize that while he has undoubtedly improved in some areas, his motivations remain as torn as ever. He also sees patient, kind non-Christians and wonders whether his behavioral improvement is simply the result of maturity and not the Holy Spirit in his life.</p>
<p>Galli&rsquo;s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not to say that we are not &ldquo;being transformed … from one degree of glory to another&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18, NRSV) even now. But it seems to me <strong>the greatest transformation is not necessarily in outward virtue, but in increasing levels of self-awareness</strong> — awareness of the depth of our sin — and consequently <strong>increasing repentance and humility</strong>. Not a humility that points to some virtue in our lives and says, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me, it was the Lord working through me,&rdquo; but the deeper humility that sees the desperately wicked heart and desperately prays daily, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty worth reading and considering in <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/may-web-only/real-transformation-happens-when.html">Galli&rsquo;s full post</a>, which I highly recommend you go read.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that seem like omissions - likely intentional on Galli&rsquo;s part but that are worth mentioning: first, that he&rsquo;s writing primarily from the perspective of one who has spent a long time in the faith. A more comprehensive look at the topic would surely recognize that the Holy Spirit can and does make dramatic changes toward holiness in the lives of believers, especially in the case of new believers who have long lived for self before coming to Christ.</p>
<p>The second thought is that Galli may be a bit hard on himself in this article. And yet, as he notes in the post, the Apostle Paul himself, near the end of his life, described himself as &ldquo;the worst of sinners&rdquo;, writing in Romans 7 that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of a conversation I had with a pastor one day on this topic where I quoted the first lines of Romans 6: &ldquo;shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?&rdquo;. I shook my head regretfully, knowing full well both Paul&rsquo;s answer to his own rhetorical question, and the fact that I too often fail to measure up.</p>
<p>The pastor&rsquo;s response was immediate, gracious, and breathtakingly honest: &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;ve generally found that to be my experience, yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find myself once again incredibly thankful for God&rsquo;s grace.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s Thursday at nearly 7 pm and I&rsquo;m on the next-to-last day of a quick business trip to France. This is my first visit to France, so my bullet point format seems useful for sharing a few assorted observations after a few days here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jet lag is aggravated by shifted working hours. At home, I&rsquo;m an early bird. Up before 5 am, at work before 7, home by 4, asleep by 10. Here work starts around 9, and dinner doesn&rsquo;t start until at least 8. Last night&rsquo;s dinner with customers started at 8:45 pm and ended just after midnight. Yummy food, but tough in the morning.</li>
<li>I think I could spend a full day exploring the Amsterdam airport before I really got bored. The place is huge. Unfortunately I only have 65-minute layovers there both directions.</li>
<li>For business hours being so late, all the shopping around here apparently closes at 5pm sharp. Makes it hard to shop for the family when I&rsquo;m not here for a weekend. (Sorry in advance, family.)</li>
<li>If I were coming here very often, I would need to learn some French.</li>
<li>The food has been really good. I guess that shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll probably set 3 alarms tonight to make sure that I wake up in time to catch my 6 am flight.</li>
<li>I know I&rsquo;m bigger than the average human, but it&rsquo;s still a little unnerving when every toilet I sit down on gives off ominous creaking noises as if it were going to fall off the wall.</li>
<li>That last bullet probably gave you an unpleasant mental image. Sorry.</li>
<li>OK, if I were really sorry I would&rsquo;ve deleted that bullet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow morning at 6am I leave Toulouse. TLS -&gt; AMS -&gt; ATL -&gt; CID and Lord willing I&rsquo;m home by 4 pm Central time. That&rsquo;s a long day, but with a happy end.</p>

			 <p>Last month I wrote <a href="/14/04/thats-not-me/">That&rsquo;s not me!</a>, in which I lamented an Atlanta-based person using my Gmail address in contact forms and various online profiles, which had the end result of me getting frequent extra emails from car dealers, football teams, and cruise lines.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, I got a little extra information. After getting another email from an Atlanta-area car dealership, I clicked on the unsubscribe link. The unsubscribe page it took me to included not just the contact email address, but also a contact cell number for texts and a contact mailing address.</p>
<p>So now, in theory, I could text or snail mail this person and let them know that their emails are coming to me. Now to decide if I <em>should</em> do so, and how confusing it might be to try to explain the issue and how I got the person&rsquo;s cell number in the first place. Hmmmm&hellip;..</p>

			 <p>As a Cubs fan I set up my Yahoo sports iPhone app at the beginning of the season to pop up an alert with the final score at the end of each game.</p>
<p>My trouble is that the Cubs are, well, the Cubs. They&rsquo;re currently 11-20 and 9.5 games back in the NL Central. (And it&rsquo;s only May 7!) Which means I see a lot more alerts that look like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And not nearly enough that look like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Which gets kind of depressing, because if the Cubs' season continues as it&rsquo;s going right now, I&rsquo;m going to see a &ldquo;Cubs Win!&rdquo; alert only about 55 times this year, and a &ldquo;Cubs Lose&rdquo; alert more than 100 times.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s an idea for some enterprising app designer: allow me to select the Cubs as my favorite team, and to get alerts for final scores, but add a flag <strong>that only alerts me when the Cubs win</strong>. That way every three or four days I get a nice surprise&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t have to deal with the disappointment the rest of the week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d buy an app like that.</p>

			 <p>I know this has been all over the internet already, but I&rsquo;m going to post it here anyway. It&rsquo;s a video of a group called Árstíðir singing the 13th-century Icelandic hymn <em>Heyr himna smiður</em> in a German train station. The acoustics&hellip; amazing.</p>

			 <p>The congratulations are due to my brother Andrew and his wife Heather on the birth of their second child, and first son, Isaiah David Hubbs. Isaiah was born this afternoon and everyone is doing well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit odd, coming from a family with mostly boys, but Isaiah is my first nephew on either side of the family. Three nieces on my wife&rsquo;s side, three daughters, and Isaiah&rsquo;s big sister have equaled out to lots of estrogen. Glad to have this young man to start to restore balance!</p>

			 <p>Because hey, I haven&rsquo;t done one of these on a Thursday for a while.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s been kinda quiet at work this week. Certainly that won&rsquo;t last.</li>
<li>Looks like I&rsquo;m going to make my first trip to Europe in a couple of weeks for some work meetings. Gonna be a lot of flying for two days of work, but it&rsquo;ll at least cement my frequent flyer status for another year.</li>
<li>With the cold wet weather all week I have this suspicion we&rsquo;re gonna go from pseudo-winter to summer without a decent stretch of spring in between. Which is kind of a bummer. I like spring.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure what it is about Stephen Hough&rsquo;s playing, but I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed every record of his that I&rsquo;ve gotten so far. (I got his new one, <a href="http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67996&amp;vw=dc">&ldquo;In the Night&rdquo;</a>, this week. Hyperion has the digital downloads available a couple weeks before the CD drops.) My favorite is still <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VYF4Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002VYF4Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=OURCUOEEZ6Q23NUT">his recording of Rachmaninov&rsquo;s second concerto</a>, though.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m annoyed that Home Sharing doesn&rsquo;t work well on iOS7. I wanted to listen to that new Stephen Hough record on my phone in my bedroom last night, and should&rsquo;ve been able to just hook up to home sharing from my iTunes library on my iMac. However, it stalls out about 80% of the way through the loading process and never actually works. Sounds like it&rsquo;s a known problem since iOS 5 or so.</li>
<li>Even with that and a few other gripes with iOS, I have a hard time believing I could be inclined to get some Android phone instead of an iPhone 6 next time I need a phone.</li>
<li>This fall will be the first time in nearly 15 years of owning a cell phone that I won&rsquo;t be champing at the bit for my 2-year contract to come up so I can get a new phone because I&rsquo;m so unhappy with my old one. (I may be champing at the bit if the iPhone 6 is particularly awesome, though. I&rsquo;d love a bigger screen, and to get a 32GB model instead of the 16GB iPhone 5 I have now.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, that ended up more tech-oriented than I thought it would. Sorry. That&rsquo;s what you get for random bullet points.</p>

			 <p>I want to take a little time today to tell you about a guy I know named Andy. (He&rsquo;s got a weird Dutch last name, so for the purposes of this post I&rsquo;ll just call him Andy.) Last week Andy announced a fairly major transition in his life (for which I&rsquo;m very happy for him) and it caused me to reflect on how he&rsquo;s impacted my life over the last decade. So, forgive a friend a little nostalgia.</p>
<p>If I trace the story I actually end up a little further back than my getting to know Andy. I go back to the early 2000s when I became a fan of a Christian folk rock band called Caedmon&rsquo;s Call. (My brother had tried to get me turned on to them in the late 90s but, as usual, it took me 5 years to catch up with his musical tastes.) I dug into Caedmons' music, and got fanboy enough to start participating regularly in an online fan forum. Yeah, I was hooked.</p>
<p>Then came a fateful day in 2001 when Derek Webb, one of the founding members of Caedmon&rsquo;s Call, announced that he was leaving the group. His replacement? This guy called Andy. Off to the fan forum I went to find out about this Andy guy. Apparently he&rsquo;d fronted a band called The Normals back in the late 90s - again I was out of the loop. But he had an acoustic record out, so I got it and really dug it. Heck, he even posted in the fan forum every now and again. Very cool.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to fall 2005. I went to see Andrew Peterson play an outdoor show and was crazy excited the night before when I found out that Andy was coming along with him. <a href="/05/10/the-first-time-ive-ever-played-a-concert-with-somebody-riding-a-cow-in-the-background/">I blogged about it and even posted a few (pretty scary) pictures.</a> I was on cloud nine.</p>
<p>With summer 2006 came the release of Andy&rsquo;s record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZNS8UG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000ZNS8UG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkId=EAMO7CVG2ROWY6PC"><em>The Morning</em></a>. With this record I felt like Andy was writing with the voice I wish I could find. Every song hit home with me. I made <a href="/06/06/road-trip-andy-o-cd-release-show/">my first road trip to Nashville</a> to see Andy play a release show for the record.</p>
<p>I followed Andy&rsquo;s career very closely after that. I drove all over the Midwest to hear him play shows. I set up a fan website. I sponsored a coffeehouse show here in Cedar Rapids. I bummed my way on to a house show road trip he took and rode along with him between a few shows. I hit him up to do lunch when I was in Nashville and hung out at a studio for a couple hours while he recorded vocals. I probably blurred the line between fan and crazy stalker a few times, but in the end I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can still call Andy my friend.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2011 Andy had another wild idea - a concept album about an astronaut on a long solo trip through space. To make <a href="https://store.rabbitroom.com/product/leonard-the-lonely-astronaut">Leonard the Lonely Astronaut</a> really complete, Andy wanted to build a rocket ship set in which to record. I spent another weekend in Nashville with a bunch of friends helping build. The great thing about that weekend is that while it was basically all about (and for) Andy, it helped cement relationships between a bunch of his fans that showed up - guys and gals that continue to be a rich online community even three years later.</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s had a tough few years since the Leonard record came out. A water line broke in his house while he and his family were on a month-long trip and he spent most of the next few months rebuilding. Work was harder to come by. He had the opportunity to tour as a part of Steven Curtis Chapman&rsquo;s band this past fall which was great for paying the bills but kinda tough on family life. (Andy and his wife have three daughters just a little younger than my own three.)</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Andy had a big announcement. Today (April 30) is his first day as an Artist and Repertoire guy at Capitol Records. It&rsquo;s a far cry from his indie days - he&rsquo;ll be working a regular job in a regular office with a salary and benefits and the whole deal. This will keep him from touring much any more, but will have the advantage of a steady income and the opportunity to be home with his family every night.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t be happier for Andy in this new phase of his life. Last night he played an online hour-long &ldquo;concert&rdquo; from his living room, streaming to fans across the world. (Hey, I know folks from Canada and Brazil who were logged in, so that counts as &ldquo;the world&rdquo;, right?) He seemed happier and more relaxed than I&rsquo;ve seen him in a long while. His daughters flitted in and out of the picture as he sang, at times singing harmony parts to songs they&rsquo;ve undoubtedly heard a hundred times. It was a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>He finished off the night with a song from his early days with The Normals, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-coLQKspzo">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Home Soon&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life it just goes on when the traveler&rsquo;s gone<br>
And that&rsquo;s the hardest part, for time has no respect<br>
For a lonely man with a longing heart<br>
&lsquo;Cause once you&rsquo;re where you&rsquo;ve wanted, everything&rsquo;s so fast<br>
But I&rsquo;ll be home soon I&rsquo;ll be home soon And if you have a place where you belong<br>
You&rsquo;re a lucky one, for time was meant to waste<br>
A laugh with good old friends or walking hand in hand<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll be there and this time I can stay<br>
But I&rsquo;ll be home soon<br>
I&rsquo;ll be home soon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a richer man for the music and community that Andy has helped bring into my life over the past decade, but I&rsquo;m so glad that he now has the opportunity to set some of it aside and just be a husband and a dad. His wife and three daughters will be glad that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home soon&rdquo; is a message they&rsquo;ll be able to hear every evening around 5:00. We&rsquo;ll hear more music from him before he&rsquo;s done. And hey, it&rsquo;s only a 10-hour drive to Nashville. Next time he plays a local show, I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>
<p>Thanks, Andy, and blessings on you and your tribe as you start this next phase of your life.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have some other posts planned, but my buddy <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof</a> pointed out something in a Supreme Court ruling today that made me chuckle.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1182_bqm1.pdf"><em>Environmental Protection Agency v. EME Homer City Generation</em></a>, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent (joined in by Justice Thomas). And Scalia never shies from making pointed opinions.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s (more or less) true! (Scalia quoted Karl Marx, but not directly from the Communist Manifesto.) On page 3 of the dissent (page 40 of the PDF) Scalia says that the &ldquo;EPA’s utterly fanciful “from each according to its ability” construction sacrifices democratically adopted text to bureaucratically favored policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Scalia wields a deft scalpel, inserting the (unattributed) quote to show even more disdain for the EPA&rsquo;s action that the majority of SCOTUS affirmed.</p>
<p>As I was paging through the decision to find the reference that Geof mentioned, I also found another reference that amused me: Justice Ginsburg (a very liberal Jewish lady) quoting from the Gospel of John:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some pollutants stay with­ in upwind States’ borders, the wind carries others to downwind States, and some subset of that group drifts to States without air quality problems. “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.” The Holy Bible, John 3:8 (King James Version)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(From page 8 of the PDF. Apparently the KJV merits a full-blown citation.)</p>
<p>So Scalia quotes Marx, and Ginsburg quotes Jesus. That&rsquo;s my amusement for the day.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/04/23/a-serious-argument.html">A Serious Argument over a Traffic Stop, or, Why I Love Reading Supreme Court Decisions</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2014/04/23/a-serious-argument.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2014-04-23 08:49:58 -0500">Apr 23, 2014</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my secret guilty pleasures (and here you get to plumb the depths of my weird mind) is reading Supreme Court opinions. (I enjoy listening to recordings of the oral arguments, too, but they can get rather dull at times.) I&rsquo;ve had a fascination with the legal system and particularly the US Supreme Court since I was in high school. I contemplated taking up law as a career path before studying engineering instead, but law continues to fascinate me.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Supreme Court is that by a time a case gets to that level, they&rsquo;re not dealing with run-of-the-mill principles or with trying to establish facts. The facts have already been established by lower courts, the principles already argued back and forth a couple times in appeals; the USSC only takes on the case when there&rsquo;s a novel principle to be decided, and when that happens, some of the top legal minds in the country get together to argue the merits.</p>
<p>The thing I enjoy about USSC opinions is that they&rsquo;re scholarly and dense without being utterly incomprehensible. I&rsquo;m no legal scholar and undoubtedly don&rsquo;t get all the case references, but I can sit and read through a 10-page opinion and pretty much understand the gist of the argument, think it over myself, and try to decide which side of the opinion I&rsquo;d come down on. And sometimes the Justices really get fired up with an opinion, and then the reading gets <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>But this shouldn&rsquo;t all be abstract - here&rsquo;s a recent example.</p>
<h3 id="navarette-v-california">Navarette v. California</h3>
<p><em>Navarette v. California</em> was argued before the Court on January 21, 2014, and the decision and opinions were published April 22 (today as I&rsquo;m writing this). The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-9490_3fb4.pdf">case summary and opinions are available on the USSC website</a>, and the headnote for the decision provides a nice summary of the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A California Highway Patrol officer stopped the pickup truck occupied by petitioners because it matched the description of a vehicle that a 911 caller had recently reported as having run her off the road. As he and a second officer approached the truck, they smelled marijuana. They searched the truck’s bed, found 30 pounds of marijuana, and arrested petitioners. Petitioners moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment. Their motion was denied, and they pleaded guilty to transporting marijuana. The California Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding that the officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigative stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So did you get that? We&rsquo;re arguing here over whether the police had a reasonable suspicion to make a traffic stop and conduct a search. The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is key here, since the 4th Amendment to the US Constitution says, in part, <strong>&ldquo;The right of the people to be secure&hellip; against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated&hellip;&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>In this particular case, an anonymous 911 caller claimed that a truck &ldquo;ran the [caller] off the roadway&rdquo; and reported the truck&rsquo;s make, model, and license plate number, suggesting that the driver might be drunk. The highway patrol found the truck, followed it for 5 minutes, didn&rsquo;t see any additional erratic driving behavior, but stopped the truck anyway. When they approached the truck, they smelled marijuana, performed a search, found a bunch of it, and made an arrest.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the question. Does the Fourth Amendment require an officer who received information regarding drunken or reckless driving to independently corroborate the behavior before stopping the vehicle?</p>
<p>Today the US Supreme Court decided that the answer is yesno. <em>[Whoopsie there! Thanks to _steve in the comment below for correcting me.]</em> Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Kennedy, and Breyer. That opinion runs from page 3 through page 13 of the decision PDF, and it&rsquo;s not incredibly dense. (It&rsquo;s also in a narrow-width column so it&rsquo;s not as long as it sounds.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s the summary paragraph of the decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like <em>White</em>, this is a “close case.” 496 U. S., at 332. As in that case, the indicia of the 911 caller’s reliability here are stronger than those in <em>J. L.</em> <a href="#fn-12215-2">2</a>, where we held that a bare-bones tip was unreliable. 529 U. S., at 271. Although the indicia present here are different from those we found sufficient in <em>White</em>, there is more than one way to demonstrate “a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.” <em>Cortez</em>, 449 U. S., at 417–418. Under the totality of the circumstances, we find the indicia of reliability in this case sufficient to provide the officer with reasonable suspicion that the driver of the reported vehicle had run another vehicle off the road. That made it reasonable under the circumstances for the officer to execute a traffic stop. We accordingly affirm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&rsquo;s not too awful or confusing, right?</p>
<p>Then the fun begins, because you have a dissenting opinion written by arch-conservative Justice Scalia which is joined by the three most liberal members of the court, Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor. And Scalia, when he gets a little bit wound up, can be entertaining. This one is a prime example.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how he starts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opinion does not explicitly adopt such a departure from our normal Fourth Amendmentrequirement that anonymous tips must be corroborated; it purports to adhere to our prior cases, such as Florida v. J. L., 529 U. S. 266 (2000), and Alabama v. White, 496 U. S. 325 (1990). <strong>Be not deceived.</strong> Law enforcement agencies follow closely our judgments on matters such as this, and they will identify at once our new rule: So long as the caller identifies where the car is, anonymous claims of a single instance of possibly careless or reckless driving, called in to 911, will support a traffic stop. This is not my concept, and I am sure would not be the Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he starts busting on the arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that has been said up to now assumes that the anonymous caller made, at least in effect, an accusation of drunken driving. But in fact she did not. She said that the petitioners’ truck “‘[r]an [me] off the roadway.’”.. That neither asserts that the driver was drunk nor even raises the likelihood that the driver was drunk. The most it conveys is that the truck did some apparently nontypical thing that forced the tipster off the roadway, whether partly or fully, temporarily or permanently. Who really knows what (if anything) happened? The truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian. But let us assume the worst of the many possibilities: that it was a careless, reckless, or even intentional maneuver that forced the tipster off the road. Lorenzo might have been distracted by his use of a hands-free cell phone&hellip; or distracted by an intense sports argument with José&hellip; Or, indeed, <strong>he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her “Make Love, Not War” bumper sticker.</strong> I fail to see how reasonable suspicion of a <em>discrete instance</em> of irregular or hazardous driving generates a reasonable suspicion of <em>ongoing intoxicated driving</em>. What proportion of the hundreds of thousands—perhaps millions—of careless, reckless, or intentional traffic violations committed each day is attributable to drunken drivers? I say 0.1 percent. I have no basis for that except my own guesswork. But unless the Court has some basis in reality to believe that the proportion is many orders of magnitude above that—say 1 in 10 or at least 1 in 20—it has no grounds for its unsupported assertion that the tipster’s report in this case gave rise to a reasonable suspicion of drunken driving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the USSC version of a smackdown, right there. But he&rsquo;s not done!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That the officers witnessed nary a minor traffic violation nor any other “sound indici[um] of drunk driving,”&hellip; strongly suggests that the suspected crime was <em>not</em> occurring after all. The tip’s implication of continuing criminality, already weak, grew even weaker. Resisting this line of reasoning, the Court curiously asserts that, since drunk drivers who see marked squad cars in their rearview mirrors may evade detection simply by driving “more careful[ly],” the “absence of additional suspicious conduct” is “hardly surprising” and thus largely irrelevant. <strong>Whether a drunk driver drives drunkenly, the Court seems to think, is up to him. That is not how I understand the influence of alcohol.</strong>'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, says Justice Scalia, &ldquo;The Court’s opinion serves up a freedom-destroying cocktail consisting of two parts patent falsity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about anybody else, but I love this stuff. And there&rsquo;s something great about America when we have some of our greatest legal minds seriously arguing over the legitimacy of a traffic stop.</p>

			 <p>Russ Goerend is a teacher, relative of a friend, and <a href="http://thoughts.russgoerend.com/post/83370455369/bullet-points">self-admitted sneaky reader of this blog</a>. He sent me a nice email the other day to introduce himself and say he was a reader, and as a matter of course I went to check out his blog, which I&rsquo;m going to follow. And right there, just three posts deep, was a post that nailed something that had been bugging me for the past week.</p>
<p>Last week I attended an industry conference in Kansas City. Attendance at this conference was evenly split between industry members and government representatives who regulate us. The goal of the conference was to address regulations as they relate to product approval and flight testing. My twitter stream indicated my frustration during the conference.</p>
<p>Russ nailed a more productive take on a similar problem in his recent post titled &ldquo;<a href="http://thoughts.russgoerend.com/post/83367886294/this-session-should-have-been-a-blog-post">This session should have been a blog post</a>&rdquo;. Attending a recent education conference session that was designed as lots of quick informational hits, he noted these thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue with that is that the presentation should have been a blog post (SHBABP). Folks who attend a SHBABP session at a conference are missing out on the chance to go deep with someone at the conference. There are quality sessions at every conference that don’t get the audience they should because of SHBABP sessions. I wrote a post the other day about the apps I use on my phone. No one would have flinched if I had submitted that to a technology conference. I could have projected my phone onto a big screen and spent a minute or two on each app. People would have been furiously scribbling the names of the apps as I went. If I was feeling generous, I could have given people time to ask questions. I didn’t submit it to a conference, though. I wrote it as a post, with links to the app store for each app. It’s more useful as a blog post. There are comments for clarification. And, it saves a space in the conference schedule for meaningful conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Too many of the presentations at my recent conference were informational data dumps that would&rsquo;ve been great - perhaps even more useful - as well-linked blog posts rather than conference sessions. The best conference sessions were ones that provided more original thought and solid Q&amp;A rather than just doing a 45-minute data dump.</p>
<p>Russ proposes an approach to fix this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, the challenge. Conference designers: make it known that you will not schedule sessions that <em>should have been a blog post</em>. Feel free to create and publicize a space or hashtag (go ahead and use #SHBABP!) for all your attendees to add and peruse <em>should have been a blog post</em> “session” links. Explain why you’re doing it. Help people understand why you’re holding the session schedule so dear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, in my industry there are a couple problems with this approach: 1) the government doesn&rsquo;t let their folks, even in key positions, publish official blogs. 2) Most of us in industry play our cards too close to our vest to have helpful blog posts, and would likely have to get them officially vetted in a way that would make them impractical.</p>
<p>Still, if I have the opportunity I will encourage conferences to avoid #SHBABP presentations, and will propose presentations that allow for helpful discussion and content rather than just doing a data dump.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had my adventures growing up in the church. In 35 years of church attendance I&rsquo;ve been a part of a C&amp;MA church, a fundie homeschooling church, two independent Bible churches, two Conservative Baptist churches, and now an EFCA congregation. My family has also been highly influenced by Mennonite and Bretheren folks along the way. We&rsquo;re an interesting crew.</p>
<p>Let me tell a little bit of my story in order to set things up.</p>
<p>In my mid 20s I was getting involved in leadership at the first church I joined as an adult. Somewhere along the line I got acquainted with Mark Driscoll and started listening through every sermon of his I could find. This led me into what has since been termed the neo-Reformed camp.</p>
<p>One year I went with my pastor to a Desiring God pastor&rsquo;s conference and heard John Piper, Mark Driscoll, Don Carson, Justin Taylor, and Voddie Baucham. I listened intently as Piper encouraged me to not waste my life, and I still have my Moleskine notebook wherein I hurriedly scribbled Driscoll&rsquo;s 14 non-negotiable points of the faith. I read C. J. Mahaney&rsquo;s book on living a cross-centered life and heard his friends tout his credentials to write on humility. I was young, still learning my theology (I&rsquo;m an engineer, not a pastor!) but had found a place I liked.</p>
<p><strong>But then somewhere along the line things started to change for me.</strong></p>
<p>I read N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>Surprised By Hope</em> and came to realize that the dispensational, <em>Left Behind</em> view of the end times didn&rsquo;t make as much sense as I had once thought. I read Peter Enns <em>Inspiration and Incarnation</em> and realized that the &ldquo;literal&rdquo; reading of the Biblical text wasn&rsquo;t always the right way to read it. My book pile got overwhelmingly Catholic and Anglican, and the Calvinist I found most winsome ended up being an Iowa essayist named Marilynne Robinson.</p>
<p>I resigned from the church plant I was helping lead because I was completely burned out and had no other way to find rest. I eventually saw that church plant transition to leadership of a young pastor who turned it into a <em>real</em> Acts 29 church plant.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of other bits of the system that I once idolized come crumbling down.</p>
<p>I saw Mark Driscoll systematically run out the folks at Mars Hill that disagreed with him, and then spend more money than some of my churches have spent in an entire year&rsquo;s budget just so he could get &ldquo;New York Times Bestselling Author&rdquo; added to his resume.</p>
<p>I saw C. J. Mahaney resign from his denomination over allegations that they covered up child abuse and that he was, ironically, one of the least-qualified people to write a book on humility.</p>
<p>I saw Justin Taylor warn authors against interviewing with a Christian radio host who accused Driscoll of plagiarism, with no word of repentance or apology when her accusations turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>I saw Doug Phillips, the head of Vision Forum (a fundie pro-homeschooling organization) and ministry partner of Voddie Baucham, resign from his ministry after confessing to having an inappropriate relationship with a girl young enough to be his daughter.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t see was a lot of public acknowledgment of sin or calls to repentance from those folks surrounding my one-time heroes. The talk was all on the &ldquo;watch blogs&rdquo;, where people wrote from perspective somewhere along the spectrum between &ldquo;godly concern&rdquo; and &ldquo;reckless rabble-rousing&rdquo;. What I did see was a lot of wagons circling, and defensive statements that were factually incorrect and either closed to comment or removed when the comments got loud.</p>
<p>I saw Gospel Coalition teachers define the Gospel in such a way that anyone outside of their little group was probably on the outside looking in. One of Driscoll&rsquo;s 14 non-negotiables I wrote down that day was penal substitutionary atonement. <a href="http://www.credomag.com/2013/06/25/why-does-the-universe-look-so-old-albert-mohler/">Al Mohler says that Young Earth Creationism is key.</a> For Wayne Grudem, Owen Strachan, and others in the CBMW, <a href="http://cbmw.org/men/leadership/giving-thanks-to-god-for-complementarians-tim-kathy-keller/">complementarianism is up there at the Gospel level</a>.</p>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t see was any acknowledgment that there have historically been various understandings of atonement theory, the age of the universe, the role of women, etc, within the accepted bounds of the church. What I didn&rsquo;t hear was an acknowledgment that there was a lot of room for negotiables within the bounds of the Apostle&rsquo;s and Nicene Creeds.</p>
<p><strong>And I&rsquo;ll be honest: it made me angry.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent too much of the last couple years being worked up about these topics. I&rsquo;ve written angry posts about <a href="/13/06/is-this-calvinisms-default-position/">neo-Reformed Calvinism</a>, <a href="/14/02/in-appreciation-of-both-sides-of-the-creation-debate/">young-earth creationism</a>, <a href="/13/02/biblicism-and-the-reformed-evangelical-magisterium/">Biblicism</a>, and <a href="/13/08/a-few-thoughts-on-the-yuck-factor-discussion/">gay marriage</a>. And what have I learned? Primarily this:</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not worth it.</strong></p>
<p>These online debates have perhaps won me a few cheers but also caused me a few headaches with people within my own church who didn&rsquo;t understand my attitude or thought I was just trying to cause trouble. They&rsquo;ve given me a feeling of righteous outrage and truth-telling, but have also helped cultivate in me an attitude of adversarial cynicism that infected my relationship with my own local church.</p>
<p>What it&rsquo;s taken me a decade to work through and realize is that an awful lot of it is just noise, just hot air. Yes, there are injustices that need to be addressed, but is my blogging actually doing anything productive there? Not really. Does anyone at my church outside of a few of the pastoral staff care about most of these topics or find them worth arguing about? Probably not.</p>
<p>So while it may be exciting to jump on the bandwagon <em>du jour</em>, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s all that profitable, at least for me right now. There are a lot of other things I can write about and very positive ways to do so. It&rsquo;s also more peaceful.</p>
<p>So, there are folks I&rsquo;m unfollowing on Twitter. There are blogs I&rsquo;m unsubscribing from. There are debates I&rsquo;m just going to stay out of. And that&rsquo;s OK.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m getting less opinionated; I&rsquo;ll just be sharing my opinions less, and hopefully in more meaningful ways and circumstances. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;ll be less upset by injustice and misconduct by church leaders, but instead I&rsquo;ll stop thinking that my blogging is doing more good for the situation than my praying would be.</p>
<p>Not having the ability to magically make peace for all of America&rsquo;s evangelical theological battles, I&rsquo;ll content myself with striving to blessedly make peace and demonstrate love in ways that are meaningful to the people around me. That, for me, is choosing the better part.</p>
<p>To those of you who have been hurt or offended by these posts of mine over the years, my sincere apologies. Let&rsquo;s talk over coffee sometime soon. I&rsquo;m buying.</p>
<p>And to those of you who do feel called to continue that sort of blogging, please continue. Go and shout from the rooftops. But also try, as much as it depends on you, to live at peace with all men. Give the benefit of the doubt. Quote accurately instead of selectively.</p>
<p>Loving and defending the innocent and helpless doesn&rsquo;t mean you always have to be an ass to the oppressor.</p>

			 <p>OK, I&rsquo;ve heard stories before about people having their email addresses added to unsavory mailing lists by pranking friends or malicious enemies, but what about the times when someone is apparently unintentionally using your email address for their legitimate purposes? Such is the odd frustration I&rsquo;ve been dealing with lately.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a Gmail account with a username in the format of <a href="mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com">firstname.lastname@gmail.com</a> ever since Gmail was invite-only. (Remember those days?) It&rsquo;s worked great for me, though eventually I&rsquo;ve semi-retired it for email in favor of using Fastmail and an email address based on my personal domain. For the past six months, though, I&rsquo;ve been getting a string of non-spam emails that appear to be intended for somebody else.</p>
<p>It started out innocuously enough, with a subscription to a mailing list of Cobb County, Georgia first responders. I requested an unsubscribe, and a real person wrote me back, a little confused why I was asking to be removed. I explained and was eventually removed from the list.</p>
<p>But then I started getting other emails. Over the past 6 months or so I&rsquo;ve gotten the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Royal Caribbean cruise itineraries and payment receipts</li>
<li>Hudl.com notifications</li>
<li>Follow-up emails from car dealers saying &ldquo;thanks for test driving, let&rsquo;s talk!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Survey requests</li>
</ul>
<p>Then on Monday came the one that made me think about this a little more seriously: <strong>an email from LifeLock with the salutation &ldquo;Dear LifeLock Wallet User:&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m just deleting these emails, but there&rsquo;s nothing that would prevent me, were I malicious, from going to the websites in question, using the email address (which, remember, is <em>my</em> email address) and the Lost Password routine to set up a new password, and I&rsquo;d have access to that person&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>Which is one level of bad if it&rsquo;s your hudl.com account (which appears to be some sort of sports training website), but an entirely different level of bad <strong>if it&rsquo;s your credit monitoring service.</strong></p>
<p>What I really don&rsquo;t understand is how this person continues to make this mistake, when s/he clearly isn&rsquo;t getting the emails in question. (I have Google 2-factor authentication active on my account, and I track my Google logins closely, so I&rsquo;m ruling out the thought that this person could be actually getting to those email messages.) If it were you, wouldn&rsquo;t you start questioning why you weren&rsquo;t receiving emails, and then eventually correct your mistake?</p>
<p>If this were, say, work email intended for another Chris Hubbs at my employer (such a person used to exist!), it&rsquo;d be easy enough to look up that person, forward the email to their <em>correct</em> address, and let them know to clarify things with their contacts. But in this case I&rsquo;ve got very little idea who the right recipient is!</p>
<p>Basically all I can do is say this: if you&rsquo;re Chris Hubbard from Atlanta, you should be aware that <a href="mailto:chris.hubbs@gmail.com">chris.hubbs@gmail.com</a> belongs to a guy in Iowa who would be happy to not keep getting your email. Or if you&rsquo;re gonna keep sending it to me, at least have the decency to send me the cruise <em>tickets</em> and not just the receipts.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/october-web-only/legacy-of-rich-mullins-ragamuffin-band.html?paging=off">This interview with Rich Mullins' producer Reed Arvin</a> is months old now, but I thought of it again the other day and wanted to share one revelation in the interview that particularly impacted me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Interviewer:] When I was a kid I would just pour over the liner notes to each of Rich&rsquo;s albums, and I was always surprised to see how few of the instruments he actually played on the recordings. Obviously, he played the hammered and lap dulcimer, but <strong>usually you were the one listed as playing piano</strong> and not him. [Arvin:] Rich was incredibly soulful musically but he possessed a particular quality many singer-pianists share: he played all over the instrument, all the time. He was used to accompanying himself, you see. He would hammer out double bass notes even if there was a bass player and things like that. So, when you added other instruments, it didn&rsquo;t quite mesh. Live, this didn&rsquo;t make so much difference. But on record, it didn&rsquo;t really work. Also, he had a very elastic sense of time. Making a record is just a different enterprise. But just to sit around the piano while he played and sang by himself, this was beautiful. And we did that sometimes, just for the pleasure of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rich was <em>the</em> formative artist for me as a musician in my teenage years. I memorized his albums, studied liner notes, learned the piano parts note-for-note, played and sang his songs incessantly.</p>
<p>What somehow never occurred to me while reading the liner notes, that never really hit me until reading this interview, is that maybe I owe Reed Arvin a lot more for influencing my piano style than I owe Rich.</p>
<p>The songs and musical ideas were all Rich&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s not going to tarnish my view of him and his legacy, but it&rsquo;s still a surprising thought.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve owned an iPhone for 18 months now, but haven&rsquo;t had a PIN in place to lock the device until yesterday. I&rsquo;m gaining the ability to put work info on the phone, but to do so I have to have a PIN and an auto-lock on it. So, I set up a PIN and set it so that I&rsquo;m required to re-enter the PIN after 15 minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s been striking to me so far (after just one day with the PIN in place) is <em>how infrequently I have to enter the PIN</em>. Most of the time when I pull my phone out to look at something, I&rsquo;m still within the 15 minute window since last time I had it out.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t really evaluated yet whether this represents an unhealthy level of attachment / addiction, but it&rsquo;s been a startling (and somewhat troubling) bit of insight.</p>

			 <p>You regular readers (all three of you) know that this blog bounces back and forth between theology and nerd stuff with frightening regularity. This is going to be a nerdy post. You have been warned.</p>
<p>Nearly 5 years ago <a href="/09/08/getting-rid-of-the-dish-the-nerd-post/">we got rid of our Dish Network satellite TV service</a> and just went to watching what we could get over the air. We&rsquo;ve evolved the setup slightly over the last 5 years, primarily by adding Netflix as a video source (our kids were 4, 3, and newborn back then, and have slightly more demands as 9, 8, and 5 now) and by adding a 27&quot; iMac in our living room that gets used as a video-watching device on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 id="the-basic-setup">The Basic Setup</h3>
<p><strong>Basement Family Room:</strong> Big LCD TV. HTPC running Windows 7. HDHomeRun networked tuner (still the 5-year-old original version) hooked up to it. 5 TB of hard drive space in that PC for storing recorded TV and other video. Running Plex Media Server to serve files to the rest of the house. Using Windows Media Center to record TV shows and playback video down there. Works like a charm. That&rsquo;s the most stable, reliable bit of the system.</p>
<p><strong>My bedroom:</strong> Ancient Mac Mini running some old version of OS X hooked up to a 20&quot; monitor, running an older version of Plex&rsquo;s Mac desktop app. Great for watching recorded TV shows. Not so great for everything else; the Plex Netflix plugin broke months ago, so if we want to watch Netflix most of the time we have to get up and open a browser and watch it that way. The Plex HDHomeRun plugin broke years ago, so if we want to watch live TV we open up the HDHomeRun app and play the video through VLC. Not integrated very well, but it works.</p>
<p><strong>Living room:</strong> 27&quot; iMac running OS X Mavericks. Here&rsquo;s where the real frustration begins. Playback of HDHomeRun live video streams through VLC is broken in Mavericks. It&rsquo;s a reported issue between VLC and Mavericks that hasn&rsquo;t gotten fixed yet. I can get HDHomeRun to work acceptably through the older Plex app if I manually tune the HDHomeRun device first and then kick up Plex to play the video stream.</p>
<p><strong><em>However</em></strong>, the old Plex app is now causing serious lockups on the iMac when I ping Plex Media Server to watch recorded shows. As in the only way to recover is to do a hard reboot on the iMac. The new version of Plex&rsquo;s app (Plex Home Theater, they call it) seems to work OK. Which is great, however, as far as I can tell there&rsquo;s no good way to view the HDHomeRun video in Plex Home Theater. Grrrr.</p>
<p>So at the moment it would appear that for the iMac I&rsquo;m going to need to juggle multiple versions of the Plex app depending on what I want to watch. Annoying.</p>
<h3 id="at-least-im-saving-money">At least I&rsquo;m saving money</h3>
<p>When I remember that we were previously spending something like $60/month on satellite, and now we&rsquo;re paying $8/mo for Netflix, we&rsquo;ve been saving around $600 a year for 5 years&hellip; maybe we should invest a little bit of that savings on improving the infrastructure. (Do you think my wife will buy that argument? Heh.) But what should I do to improve things?</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-go-from-here">Where do I go from here?</h3>
<p>The home media server solution is working really well, and Windows 7 recording the TV shows is reliable, pretty much seamless. Gonna keep it going as long as I can.</p>
<p>I know the HDHomeRun hardware has been upgraded 3 or 4 times since I bought my original device. Don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d get any significant improvements from buying a new one, but it&rsquo;s hard to be motivated to drop $100 on a new one when the old one still works so well.</p>
<p>I think in the living room I&rsquo;ve basically locked myself into the iMac solution since we don&rsquo;t have the room for (or the desire for) a big real TV in the living room. If we move to a new house in the next year or two, we&rsquo;ll re-evaluate.</p>
<p>Back in our bedroom I think the solution that would get us closest is to replace the Mac Mini and monitor with a real TV and some version of set-top box - maybe a Roku or the new Amazon FireTv. FireTV is new, but it looks like it would get us Netflix, Amazon Video, ESPN video, and even integrate with Plex. About the only thing it wouldn&rsquo;t support is the HDHomeRun integration; but I suppose I could always split off a signal from the antenna in the attic and run a TV signal down to the TV and use its tuners natively.</p>
<h3 id="thats-all-great-but">That&rsquo;s all great, but&hellip;</h3>
<p>While a nerd can dream, in reality we&rsquo;ll likely be trying to sell our current house and buy a larger one (3 daughters and only one upstairs bathroom!) in the next year or two. So in reality I suppose we&rsquo;ll hang on with what we&rsquo;ve got until we make a move, and then re-assess the entire setup at that point.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-bit-of-perspective">A little bit of perspective</h3>
<p>Just so I don&rsquo;t sound like a totally self-absorbed idiot for the entire post, let me note that I remember moving from a black-and-white TV to our first color TV back when I was a kid, and in going to a video rental store for the first time when you had to choose between VHS and Betamax versions of the videos. Compared to those days&hellip; I guess our expectations have gone up a bit in 30 years.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of virtual ink spilled in the Christian blogosphere on the gay marriage topic the past couple of weeks after the World Vision U-turn. One of the benefits of not saying anything about it myself is that eventually someone comes along who says things a lot better than I would. Today that person is <a href="http://jenhatmaker.com/blog/2014/04/02/where-i-stand">Jen Hatmaker</a>. (All the emphasis in the quotes below is hers.)</p>
<p>First, she says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the reason I’ve always held this conviction [about where she stands on homosexuality] close, inviting only my real friends and family and community in, is because I am loathe to be a pawn in a hateful public war. I refuse to be a point in some win column, used for my influence and lumped into ancillary groupthink I don’t share. I’ve said before that this conversation best belongs in true relationships, around dinner tables, over coffee, in real life, and I still believe that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet for the sake of those following her as a leader, she is willing to lay her cards on the table:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you to know that I land on the side of traditional marriage as God’s first and clear design. I believe God’s original creation is how we were crafted to thrive: in marriage, in family, and in community, which has borne out for millennia in Scripture, interpretation, practice, and society (within and without the church).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, she&rsquo;s not done, and her follow-up point is important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, I remain disturbed and pierced at how many Christians have handled the gay community publicly. It is a source of extreme grief. We may share theology, but <em>the application of that truth</em> remains a disconnecting point. While Scripture does command us to “speak the truth in love” (and surely Facebook is the dead worst place to exercise that practice), <strong>that is not the end of our biblical responsibility.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then recounts Jesus' summing up all the law and the prophets as &ldquo;love God and love your neighbor&rdquo;. Powerful stuff. And the man wanted to know &ldquo;who is my neighbor&rdquo;? What&rsquo;s my out? And Jesus tells the parable of the Good Samaritan.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Jen&rsquo;s words again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I lay in bed, it was instantly and perfectly clear that the gay community has been spiritually beaten, stripped of dignity, robbed of humanity, and left for dead by much of the church. <strong>You need only look at the suicide rates, prevalence of self-harm, and the devastating pleas from ostracized gay people and those who love them to see what has plainly transpired.</strong> Laying next to them, bloodied and bruised, are believers whose theology affirms homosexuality and allows them to stand alongside their gay friends. (Again, you don’t have to agree with this, but there are tens of thousands of thinking, studied people who hold this conviction.) <strong>The spiritual gutting of these brothers and sisters is nothing short of shameful.</strong> The mockery and dismissal and vitriol leveled at these folks is disgraceful. Also wounded on the side of the road are Christians who sincerely love God and people and believe homosexuality is a sin, but they’ve been lumped in with the Big Loud Mean Voices unfairly. <strong>Painted as hateful intolerants, they are actually kind and loving and are simply trying to be faithful.</strong> The paintbrush is too wide, the indictments unfounded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then she brings it home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t get to abandon the theology of love toward people; the end does not justify the means. That is not Christ-like and it is certainly not biblical. <strong>As a faith community, it is time we relearn what “speaking the truth in love” means. Something that actually feels like love is a start. If the beginning and end of love is simply pointing out sin, then we are doomed.</strong> &hellip; I am convinced we need no more soldiers in this war. We need more neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Jen, for a powerful word.</p>

			 <p>OK, this is pretty great. Organist <a href="http://www.rjeproductions.com/">Jelani Eddington</a> performs a suite from the Star Wars soundtrack on a massive pipe organ. The <a href="http://www.sanfilippofoundation.org/pipe-organ.html">organ was built by Wurlitzer in 1927 for a theater in Omaha, NE</a>, and after restoration has been installed at <a href="http://www.sanfilippofoundation.org/index.html">a museum in the suburbs of Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>A little more about the organ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mounted on the wall to the left are the 32' Diaphone pipes, and to the right are the 32' Bombarde pipes. A 32-note set of Deagan Tower Bells, the largest of which weighs 426 lb., hang on each side of the room. They are activated by huge solenoids from their own console, the organ console, a roll player, and even the doorbell button. To the rear of the room, the &lsquo;Ethereal&rsquo; pipe chamber in the attic echoes softly from the skylight area, while the brass &lsquo;Trumpet Imperial&rsquo; and copper &lsquo;Bugle Battaglia&rsquo; speak with great authority from the back wall. &hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --><br>
The grand piano connected to the pipe organ is a 9' Knabe concert grand with an Ampico &lsquo;A&rsquo; reproducing player mechanism. To the right of the console is a rare Deagan Piano-Vibraharp, which can be played by its own keyboard or from the organ console. Toward the rear of the room is a Spanish art case Steinway model A.R. Duo-Art reproducing piano, veneered in walnut with boxwood, pear and ebony inlay. A remote Duo-Art Concertola roll changer has been adapted to play Ampico rolls on the Knabe, or Duo-Art rolls on the Steinway, at the touch of a button on its control panel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crazy. Anyhow, this video itself is impressive:</p>

			 <p>Because hey, I like this format.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just when you think spring was here, we get snow. The ground and roads were covered this morning. Ick. At least it&rsquo;s melted off by this afternoon.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a 60 degree day in the forecast. I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.</li>
<li>Of course, next week I&rsquo;ll be in Florida for work where the highs are supposed to be in the low 80&rsquo;s every day.</li>
<li>You aren&rsquo;t reading this just to get Chris&rsquo;s thoughts on the weather, are you?</li>
<li>I just submitted a big proposal at work this afternoon. Praying that it is looked upon favorably.</li>
<li>I desperately need some other music to get rid of the Frozen soundtrack earworm that&rsquo;s plagued me the past week. The girls have been singing &ldquo;Do you want to build a snowman?&rdquo; incessantly.</li>
<li>I did something this morning I haven&rsquo;t done in ages - turned off my alarm w/o realizing it and overslept past something on my calendar, in this case my Tuesday morning Bible study. Oops.</li>
<li>I have fresh brownies on the stove and a chapter of <em>The Hobbit</em> to read to the girls, so this will be my last bullet.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s a fascinating article on The Atlantic site that&rsquo;s been making the rounds recently, and it&rsquo;s well worth a read. Author Hanna Rosin, in her article <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/03/hey-parents-leave-those-kids-alone/358631/">&ldquo;The Overprotected Kid&rdquo;</a>, examines how attitudes toward children and risk have changed in the past few decades. Where in the 70s parents would&rsquo;ve just turned kids loose, kids are now more frequently monitored, reined in, and protected. She tells about a playground experiment in Britain where they&rsquo;ve gone the other direction - removing the rubberized, &ldquo;safe&rdquo; equipment in favor of lots of raw material, limited adult intervention, and very few rules. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>Now, the article is well worth considering from the sociological and parenting angles, but this bit stuck out at me from a faith angle as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One common concern of parents these days is that children grow up too fast. <strong>But sometimes it seems as if children don’t get the space to grow up at all; they just become adept at mimicking the habits of adulthood.</strong> As Hart’s research shows, children used to gradually take on responsibilities, year by year. They crossed the road, went to the store; eventually some of them got small neighborhood jobs. Their pride was wrapped up in competence and independence, which grew as they tried and mastered activities they hadn’t known how to do the previous year. But these days, middle-class children, at least, skip these milestones. <strong>They spend a lot of time in the company of adults, so they can talk and think like them, but they never build up the confidence to be truly independent and self-reliant.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m shooting from the hip here, so feel free to jump in and set me straight in the comments if you want, but from my experience in the evangelical church it seems that we might be treating our children <em>in the faith</em> the same way. Let me tease that out a bit.</p>
<p>Are our children in the faith, whether new adult converts or children who have been raised in the church, really given the space to grow up in the faith? Or have we simply encouraged an environment that is the spiritualized equivalent of &ldquo;let me walk you to school&rdquo; and &ldquo;stay away from that creek, you might get wet!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In our desire to protect young believers, are we unhealthily protecting them from the spiritual bumps and bruises that come from healthy exploration? Rather than wrapping protective material around any potentially difficult or painful spiritual point, should we instead be encouraging exploration, learning, and growth?</p>
<p>In a related vein, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2014/03/leaving-a-church-well-or-is-your-church-spiritually-co-dependent/">Peter Enns notes today</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you ask me, one reason God might have for different denominations and traditions is they they reflect different stages of the spiritual journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, quoting psychologist David G. Benner, he reminds us that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;communities exist for the support of others, not their control. Like enmeshed familes or codependent marriages and partnerships, [unhealthy] communities fail to see the other as separate from themselves and to celebrate this fact and then help people achieve this differentiation in a healthy manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, allowing room for exploration and real growth (as opposed to just learning imitation) allows us to celebrate individuals as they grow into their own identity. Certainly gives me things to think on as a parent; there may be a lesson there for pastors and church leaders, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q – Randy, are you a heretic or something? What is wrong with you? First, am I a heretic?<br>
No. I hold to the commonly shared beliefs of the church universal without exception. What I am is a critic of the evangelical church in the USA in our era. This church has lost its focus on Jesus and has become some kind of leisure time entertainment/marketing organization. Not that there is anything wrong with that; but of course, there is something wrong with that. Some people fail to distinguish between a local manifestation of the idea of the church and the church itself. If you fail to distinguish those two things, you might see me as destructive rather than constructive. You’ll have to believe me when I say that I love the church. But not everything that calls itself a church is really a church. &hellip; Second, what is wrong with me? Lots and lots of stuff.</p>

But if you are a Christian liberal, if you are a Christian conservative, then <strong>by definition there will be tensions between your Christianity and your political ideology.

			 <p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about Christian celebrity the past several days, but <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2014/03/on-christian-celebrity.html">Richard Beck hits on something important this morning</a> by making the distinction between being popular and being a celebrity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, the diagnostic test that you are dealing with a Christian celebrity isn&rsquo;t the fact that the person is in a spotlight speaking to thousands. Because that might just be a talented and popular person up there. And there&rsquo;s no shame or elitism in that. What makes the person a celebrity or not isn&rsquo;t the size of the crowd. What makes the person a celebrity is where the person is <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the talk. Let me repeat that. The test of Christian celebrity is where the person is before and after the talk. If the person giving the talk is in the audience before and/or after the talk then that&rsquo;s not a Christian celebrity. That&rsquo;s just a talented and popular speaker. By coming &ldquo;down from the stage&rdquo; to be with the crowd&ndash;it&rsquo;s an Incarnational move here&ndash;the speaker is erasing any elite distance or distinction between themselves and their audience. Connecting with the crowd before and after is an act of solidarity, hospitality, humility and service. The speaker is making themselves available. And that <em>availability</em> is the exact opposite of celebrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very helpful distinction. I remember attending a Desiring God pastors conference probably a decade ago and seeing Mark Driscoll ushered in by security after everyone else had already been seated, and quickly ushered out after he had spoken and before anyone else could get up to leave. That gives one sort of impression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, two years ago <a href="http://boarsheadtavern.com/2012/05/09/a-little-more-on-seeing-n-t-wright/">I went to Nashville to a small event where N. T. Wright was speaking</a>. Dr. (Bishop? Rev.? not sure what title he prefers) Wright had just flown in from England that day. While clearly the focus of the event, he spent the first hour of the evening sitting in the crowd enjoying the local musicians who were there to sing, then after speaking for an hour spent at least another 90 minutes patiently signing books, taking pictures, and talking to a long line of folks. Popular? Yeah. Celebrity? Not that day.</p>
<p>The discussion also reminds me of this picture which I saw recently in the news:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s the Pope, on a Lenten retreat, just another priest in a pew. Now, granted, Pope Francis is a celebrity by about any definition; but it seems clear to me that he&rsquo;s trying as hard as he can to <em>not</em> be a celebrity; to be personal, real, accessible, and pastoral even in the most visible religious role in the world.</p>
<p>Even us non-celebrity (and even non-popular) folks could learn a lesson or two from the good Bishops of Durham and Rome..</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.christenacleveland.com/2014/03/urban-church-plantations/">Some challenging thoughts from Christina Cleveland today:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we truly saw ourselves as an interdependent body with a shared Head, resources, blood, and life, then suburban churches that want to love on a city wouldn’t do it by expanding their empires across city lines. They would do it by truly sharing their resources, blood and life in service to the Head. <em>Why build a new church building in the city when you can build one for an urban church – in desperate need of a new building– that is already there doing great work?</em> <em>Why hire a new pastor to work at your new urban church plant, when you can give an urban church the resources to make their long-suffering bi-vocational pastor full-time?</em> <em>Why fund a new urban service project when you can fund the urban service projects that people of color have been running tirelessly and effectively on a shoe-string budget for years?</em> The empire says that <em>our</em> church needs to be present in every community, <em>our</em> church has the answers, and <em>our</em> church’s resources are our resources alone. If we follow this path, power dynamics remain unchanged and urban church plantations ensue. The better, more honoring path requires equity – which is costly. Just ask the rich, young ruler. Jesus asked him to reject his empire approach to life, stop being so possessive about his possessions, and join the interdependent family of God.</p>

<li>Did my first three-service weekend on worship team the last two days. I think I made the right decision to go to only one week per month.</li>
<li>The worship set, albeit short, was a good one.</li>

<li>Have come to happy acceptance of the fact that I&rsquo;ll never really be a soloist, but I can be a darn good backup singer. That works for me.</li>
<li>Work has recently given me a case of &lsquo;be careful what you wish for because you might just get it&rsquo;. More to follow, but it&rsquo;ll be an interesting next few months.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re right in the middle of birthday week at the Hubbs house. Two birthdays down, one to go. Being 37 doesn&rsquo;t make me feel nearly as old as having my youngest daughter turn 5 does.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark Driscoll is one person, a uniquely talented individual. Yet he is also a function of structural problems within the new Reformed movement itself. Despite its distinct and in many ways sophisticated theology, the “young, restless, and reformed” movement has always been in some respects simply the latest manifestation of the weakest aspects of American Evangelicalism. It was, and is, a movement built on the power of a self-selected band of dynamic personalities, wonderful communicators, and talented preachers who have been marketed in a very attractive manner. Those things can all be great goods but when there is no real accountability involved, when financial arrangements are opaque in the extreme, and when personalities start to supplant the message, serious problems are never far away.</p>

			 <p>A few months back I tried a great blog migration - moving from Wordpress to Octopress, a Ruby-based static site generator. Octopress had the virtue of being static, of having posts in Markdown files instead of HTML in a database, and of generally being slimmer than Wordpress.</p>
<p>What I found after a few months of use is that the friction to use Octopress was just higher than I was willing to accept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write post content.</li>
<li>rake generate new_post</li>
<li>Paste in the new post.</li>
<li>rake generate</li>
<li>rake preview - make sure the post looks OK</li>
<li>svn add the new post file + new static files</li>
<li>svn commit to push them up to the server</li>
<li>log in to my webserver</li>
<li>svn update</li>
</ul>
<p>All that for a single post. And if I wanted to post from a different machine, I had to remember to do an svn update first to make sure I was current everywhere. It wasn&rsquo;t a fatal issue, but just more of a pain than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>Wordpress also allows nice things like posting from other apps, from my phone, etc. Not that I do much of that at the moment&hellip; but my intentions are good.</p>
<p>So my apologies to the half-dozen of you who subscribe to my RSS feed and saw it burp a dozen old posts last night. I got everything moved back into Wordpress and I think things are good to go.</p>
<p>The one thing I actually will miss is the ability to write my posts in Markdown. I know there&rsquo;s a WP Markdown plugin but I&rsquo;m not real thrilled with it. Oh well, I can manage HTML.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I wrote a response to a post wherein someone else argued that church praise bands, by virtue of the type of music they play, speak a special language and have become a worship intermediary for the congregation. <a href="/14/03/do-praise-bands-speak-a-secret-language/">I disagreed to an extent</a>, but promised some thoughts on principles for leading worship that can make participatory congregational worship more effective. Here are those thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="planning">Planning</h3>
<p>On the planning side we need to carefully consider what new songs we bring into our congregational repertoire. We need new songs. We may find songs that play on Christian radio that are good choices; we will also find plenty there that are not. We will undoubtedly get requests from church members (and leaders!) to sing their new favorite radio song on some Sunday. This may times turn up good new songs; however, it may also be an area where we need to graciously exercise leadership and say no. If a song seems a little bit too simple and too easy for your highly-talented praise band, it&rsquo;s probably just about right for your congregation.</p>
<p>We also need to be careful about the rate at which we introduce new songs. Back when I was leading on a weekly basis, when it was time to introduce a new song we would sing the song two weeks in a row, skip a week, and sing it again the fourth week before then adding it to our regular repertoire list. I would alsobe sure that every other song we sang those four weeks was a familiar song.</p>
<p>These two suggestions actually complement each other pretty well: if you&rsquo;re more choosy about what songs you want to add to your repertoire, you won&rsquo;t feel such pressure to add new songs at an uncomfortable frequency. And you can still manage to work in at least 10 new songs a year, which isn&rsquo;t bad.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>Lots has already been written on this topic, so I&rsquo;m unlikely to say anything very new or novel. I love my church&rsquo;s approach of having a large number of vocalists on the stage; it takes the pressure and focus off of any one or two people being soloists and lets us sing as a mini-congregation right there in the band.</p>
<p>Modern popular praise bands have developed an environment that resembles a rock concert more than a congregational time of worship, and the temptation is there to roll that right into our Sunday mornings. (I&rsquo;ll leave only <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mKZpf3gPg">one example</a> here.) The issue isn&rsquo;t that they like to play rock music and that there&rsquo;s a crowd that enjoys it. The issue is that we often, consciously or not, take it as a model for how our Sunday morning worship should look and sound. And that can be a problem.</p>
<p>If, during congregational worship, the focus frequently gets shifted to a gifted soloist, or a kickin' guitar solo, or some novel and funky instrumentation, it&rsquo;s a distraction. We&rsquo;ve verged into concert territory and turned our congregation into an audience <em>for the band</em> instead of regular participants in worship. (There&rsquo;s still room for &lsquo;special music&rsquo;, though. I&rsquo;ll get to that.)</p>
<h3 id="really-leading">Really Leading</h3>
<p>The other key thing we can do as leaders during the service requires a focus on that word: <strong>leading</strong>. One of the nicest things a person ever said to me after I led music in a service was that they felt like I had really <em>led</em> them; that there was no uncertainty about what was coming next, or what they were supposed to be doing; they were able to just comfortably settle into worship.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where we can be very practical in our leadership. If we&rsquo;re introducing a new song, we should say so up front. If a band member is going to sing the first verse solo to allow everyone else to learn the tune, cue the congregation to that fact so they don&rsquo;t feel the uncertainty of wondering when they&rsquo;re expected to sing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s still room for &ldquo;special music&rdquo; if that&rsquo;s a regular part of your worship tradition, but set it apart in the service in a way that it&rsquo;s clear what the intent is. By saying &ldquo;Julie has a song to share with us now, so please have a seat and listen to the message of this song&rdquo;, we can prepare our congregation to receive the song far better than if we just have the soloist start singing as if the song were just another part of the worship set.</p>
<p>Physical and verbal cues during songs are important ways to lead, too. Especially in songs where there may be more time between verses - provide clear cues to the congregation as to when to come in. Maybe just call out the first few words of the next line. (The person running your lyrics on the projector will appreciate this, too!)</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>Leading worship is an art as much as a science, but if we can approach it humbly and pastorally we will always be finding ways where we can improve as leaders, with the result being more appealing and engaging worship services. It should never be about <em>us</em>; it should always be about <em>Him</em>.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I ran across a recent post from Lutheran pastor Erik Parker provocatively titled <a href="http://millennialpastor.net/2014/03/03/praise-bands-are-the-new-medieval-priests/">&ldquo;Praise Bands are the new Medieval Priests&rdquo;</a>. In it Rev. Parker says that praise bands are alienating him from worship.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just can’t access Praise music anymore, I don’t hear Praise songs as the music of worship. I find myself wondering why I am just standing there, in the midst of a group of people who are also not singing. As the Praise band performs song after song, I am consistently lost as to how the music goes, what verses will come next, how to follow the melody, when to start and stop singing, or when a random guitar solo will be thrown in right when I thought I had figured out when the next verse starts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parker recounts a recent church service where he observed that even as the very talented praise band was playing beautiful music, the people in the pews were, for the most part, &ldquo;not really being a part of the music at all&rdquo;, but rather just bystanders, &ldquo;being played at, rather than played with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Parker draws the analogy that modern praise bands are the new medieval priests - leading worship in a &lsquo;language&rsquo; that few speak or can participate in. As such, he claims, &ldquo;Praise Bands are incompatible with a worship that is done by the community&hellip; they are a performative medium, not a participatory one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I posted a link to the piece on Facebook last night and got an interesting mix of responses. A friend who has recently been looking for a new church noted that being directed to raise her hands to a song she has never even heard before makes her feel like a bystander rather than a participant in worship.</p>
<p>Another friend who grew up on the mission field in Africa said that music in small African churches that can&rsquo;t afford a sound system is much more participative than in those that can. As he notes: &ldquo;human nature being what it is, everyone turns it [the volume] up.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="what-language-is-that-again">What Language is that, again?</h3>
<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;m a member of a praise band. I have spent nearly all of my adult life either leading or playing in praise bands on a regular basis. So I clearly am unlikely to agree with the full premise of Rev. Parker&rsquo;s post. However, I think he has identified some concerning symptoms, even if he has perhaps misidentified the true problem.</p>
<p>I share Rev. Parker&rsquo;s concerns about planning congregational music that is regularly unfamiliar and difficult to sing. I have been a part of rehearsals where a team of professional-caliber musicians have had to work for a solid hour to get <em>one new song</em> learned to the point where we can sing and play it consistently. I have on more than one occasion wondered out loud how the congregation had any chance of singing the song on their one time through it if it took the band an hour to figure it out.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - it&rsquo;s imperative that we continue to teach our congregations new songs. But when our primary musical influence is Top 40 Christian radio, the songs we&rsquo;re pushed to select are often difficult songs to sing, often requiring an unnaturally large vocal range and designed for professional vocalists. That concerns me.</p>
<p>A similar issue often exists with song familiarity. If my own experience is representative at all, our &lsquo;best&rsquo; worship times come when we sing familiar songs. Familiarity allows us to think less about learning the words, melody, and arrangement, and think more about the message of the song. It&rsquo;s no accident that a congregation stands mostly silent as the band leads a new song from the radio but then wholeheartedly belts out all four verses of a 200-year-old hymn.</p>
<h3 id="its-not-necessarily-about-the-band">It&rsquo;s not (necessarily) about the band.</h3>
<p>Where I think Rev. Parker gets it wrong is in pointing the finger at the Praise Band as the issue. The praise band is not the issue. Praise bands, playing in pretty much any style, can do music in a way that engages and draws in a congregation, or can do music in a way that pushes the congregation off to be &lsquo;the audience&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;the body&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rev. Parker makes a fair point that style can distract from real congregational worship. As he puts it, &ldquo;rock bands are by design meant to overwhelm the audience with sound.&rdquo; And I agree with him that overwhelming a congregation with sound isn&rsquo;t conducive to congregational worship. But I&rsquo;ve also attended services in Parker&rsquo;s own denomination where more traditional instrumentation was used in a way and at a volume that still served to overwhelm the congregation. So it isn&rsquo;t strictly about instrumentation or style.</p>
<p>However, there are planning and execution aspects that as worship leaders we can focus on to provide consistent inclusive congregational worship. Rather, though, than turning this into a two-thousand-word post, I think I&rsquo;ll save those ideas for tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just a reaction to still being in the tail end of 3 months of a cold winter back home, but give me a trip to Phoenix this week, a rental car with a sunroof, and a couple free afternoon hours, and I felt the road calling my name.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been to Arizona before this week. It&rsquo;s a far cry from the midwest that I&rsquo;ve usually called home, but there&rsquo;s a stark beauty to its dark, jagged mountains and sandy, scrubby terrain. The road lies out straight and flat for countless miles with little more than an occasional cactus breaking up the line to the peaks on the horizon.</p>
<p>So tonight, with two busy weeks of work travel almost behind me (home to Iowa tomorrow!) and a couple hours of sunlight, I turned the little SUV south, opened the windows and sunroof, and turned up the music. It took me a little while to get out of town and to roads less traveled, but eventually I turned off the main highway, crossed a cattle guard to turn onto a county road, and let my cares slowly filter out into the wind rushing past my window.</p>
<p>The music, both familiar (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WTPB40/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004WTPB40&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Bruce Hornsby</a>) and new (Beck&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IB73QTG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00IB73QTG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20"><em>Morning Phase</em></a> just came out today and is lovely) kept me company as the miles slipped behind. Prayers were spoken. Frustrations and hopes spilled out and were released to God. Little by little the beautiful broken emptiness of the desert reminded me of a greater hope, a hope that we all have for redemption.</p>
<p>Though 30 minutes of real traffic-free driving went by far too fast, there was also a certain cheerfulness to seeing the city lights signaling the return to civilization. Springtime is good for the soul, and my only regret from today is that I didn&rsquo;t have the time to take a longer drive and see more. A friend advised that the two-hour drive through the hills up to Sedona is worthwhile. Next time I&rsquo;ll have to see if I can get there.</p>

			 <p>Last week I finally got the chance to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VM8QK0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003VM8QK0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20"><em>The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate</em></a> by John H. Walton. Dr. Walton is a professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College. His PhD is from the Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, which is, curiously enough (per Wikipedia), the primary seminary for training rabbis in Reform Judaism. All that to say the guy has a better-than-average understanding of the Old Testament, Jewish culture, and the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>Walton&rsquo;s premise is one that, while previously unfamiliar to me, makes the most sense of how Genesis 1 - 2 should be understood as anything else I&rsquo;ve read on the topic. <em>The Lost World of Genesis One</em> is structured around 20 premise statements, and in summary where he lands is this: we need to read and understand Genesis 1 in the same way the original audience read it. This turns out to be significantly different than we often hear it understood. As a very high-level summary, here&rsquo;s what he says:</p>
<h3 id="ancient-cosmology-is-functional">Ancient Cosmology is Functional</h3>
<p>What does it mean for the universe to exist?, Walton asks. He proposes that people in the ancient world &ldquo;believed that something existed not by virtue of its material properties, <em>but by virtue of its having a function in an ordered system</em>.&rdquo; In such a view, he says, something could be manufactured physically but still not &ldquo;exist&rdquo; if it has not become functional.</p>
<p>Walton compares the creation stories of several different ancient cultures and notes that in each case, the creation story suggests not the creation of physical elements, but in the god ordering and purposing those elements into a functioning world. Certainly it&rsquo;s not a stretch to think that the Israelites would&rsquo;ve understood their creation story similarly.</p>
<h3 id="divine-rest-is-in-a-temple">Divine Rest is in a Temple</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with God resting? Day seven, says Walton, is the climax of the story. Key, he says is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the piece of information that everyone knew in the ancient world and to which most modern readers are totally oblivious: Deity rests in a temple, and only in a temple. This is what temples were built for. We might even say that this is what a temple is— a place for divine rest. Perhaps even more significant, in some texts the construction of a temple is associated with cosmic creation&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;in the ancient world rest is what results when a crisis has been resolved or when stability has been achieved , when things have “settled down.” Consequently normal routines can be established and enjoyed. For deity this means that the normal operations of the cosmos can be undertaken. This is more a matter of engagement without obstacles rather than disengagement without responsibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-seven-days-of-genesis-1-do-not-concern-material-origins">The Seven days of Genesis 1 Do Not Concern Material Origins</h3>
<p>Says Walton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the seven days refer to the seven days of cosmic temple inauguration, days that concern origins of functions not material, then <strong>the seven days and Genesis 1 as a whole have nothing to contribute to the discussion of the age of the earth.</strong> This is not a conclusion designed to accommodate science —it was drawn from an analysis and interpretation of the biblical text of Genesis in its ancient environment. The point is not that the biblical text therefore supports an old earth, but simply that <strong>there is no biblical position on the age of the earth.</strong> If it were to turn out that the earth is young, so be it. But most people who seek to defend a young -earth view do so because they believe that the Bible obligates them to such a defense. I admire the fact that believers are willing to take unpopular positions and investigate all sorts of alternatives in an attempt to defend the reputation of the biblical text. <strong>But if the biblical text does not demand a young earth there would be little impetus or evidence to offer such a suggestion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="empirical-science-cannot-speak-to-purpose">Empirical Science Cannot Speak to Purpose</h3>
<p>&ldquo;If public education is committed to the idea that science courses should reflect only empirical science, neither design nor metaphysical naturalism is acceptable because they both import conclusions about purpose into the discussion,&rdquo; says Walton.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those concerned with the purity of science, the focus on descriptive mechanisms in an empirical discipline will be welcomed, and considering legitimate weaknesses in the reigning paradigm should pose no problem since science always accepts critiques— that is how it develops and improves. For those concerned about the Bible and the integrity of their theology, the descriptive mechanisms that compose the evolutionary model need not be any more problematic for theology than the descriptive disciplines of meteorology or embryology. <em>[This hearkens back to a point he made earlier in the book.]</em> &hellip; If all parties were willing to agree to similar teleological neutrality in the classrooms dedicated to instruction in empirical science, the present conflict could move more easily toward resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a conclusion that I find very liberating. It suggests that we can simultaneously affirm that God is the creator and origin of everything, and at the same time not be afraid of following science wherever it&rsquo;s currently leading. Science can&rsquo;t prove or disprove purpose or fundamental origins, and theology (in this view) need not lead us to dispute the current scientific understanding of origins.</p>
<p><em>The Lost World of Genesis One</em> is a straightforward read, and I highly recommend it for any casual student of theology who wants a different perspective on understanding the creation account. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VM8QK0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003VM8QK0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">The Kindle edition</a> is currently less than six bucks, which is a pretty good deal.</p>

			 <p>Last night my wife and I went to see Jim Brickman in concert at the Paramount here in Cedar Rapids. This is the second time we&rsquo;ve seen this age-defying (the guy is over 50 and looks about 30!) pianist perform, and I have just a few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>To my ear, he played three wrong notes the entire evening, all of them before intermission. (Impressive, given the ridiculous number of notes he plays)</li>
<li>Either his piano is waaaaay too bright or he plays everything too loud. His performance has very little sense of dynamics. Everything starts at a solid <em>forte</em> and ends up somewhere around <em>fortissimo</em>.</li>
<li>The guy never stops using the sustain pedal. He mentioned during the concert that he only took a few classical piano lessons, and that all he ever wanted to play was pop music. If he&rsquo;d taken a few more classical lessons, a good teacher would&rsquo;ve beat some better pedal technique into him. As it is, his sound is <em>uber</em>-muddy.</li>
<li>The dude has the most dramatic arm movements as he finishes a song of anybody I&rsquo;ve ever seen play. Were I to try to do a parody, I think all I&rsquo;d need is a few chord structures and those arm movements and I&rsquo;d have it nailed. Might have to try it sometime.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so I&rsquo;m just a cranky pianist who shakes my head at the popular success of a guy like Brickman. It&rsquo;s gotta be kinda weird to be able to say (as he did last night,) &ldquo;this is the song that you&rsquo;ll hear if you go to the kiosk at Target and push on my face&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But hey, it was a nice night out, my wife was happy, and we both agreed at the end of the evening that we&rsquo;ve probably heard enough of Jim Brickman for a while. I&rsquo;ll call that a Valentine&rsquo;s Eve win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the beautiful things about being slow to respond to the internet topic <em>du jour</em> is that sometimes other people come along and say what you want to say, only better and more concisely. So it is with me on the creation debate topic this week.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had 1500 words written on the topic. Then today I found two posts that sum up my thoughts better than I was able to. (Brevity, Chris. Learn brevity.)</p>
<p>First up, let me point you to Richard Beck, writing today about <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2014/02/creation-wars-in-church.html">Creation Wars in Church</a>. After noting that he once was removed from consideration for a tenured post at a &ldquo;flagship school&rdquo; of evangelicalism because of his interest in evolutionary psychology, Beck says this: &ldquo;I get it. This is still a big issue in many places. But here&rsquo;s the thing I&rsquo;ve been pondering: Is this an issue in the local church?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I ask because creation vs. evolution just isn&rsquo;t an issue in my church. I go to church with people who have PhDs in biology and people who teach creationism in their home-school curriculum. The people at my church are all over the map on this issue. Some were with Ken Ham Tuesday night. And some were with Bill Nye.</p>
<p>And we all go to the same church.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that possible? I&rsquo;m not sure, but my best guess is this. We just don&rsquo;t think it matters. We just don&rsquo;t talk about it. You are free to think however you want to think about this. We don&rsquo;t make it a test of fellowship. We recognize the diversity in our midst and have sort of collectively agreed to not make it an issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me happy, both for Dr. Beck and because I think the same is largely true in my own church body. We all have opinions, but we as a matter of practice don&rsquo;t make it a divisive issue. There are bigger things to be concerned with.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Michael Brendan Dougherty&rsquo;s <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/256163/in-defense-of-creationists">In Defense of Creationists</a>. He manages to be both annoyingly condescending toward but lovingly appreciative of devoted Christian creationists all at once. It&rsquo;s worth reading the whole piece, but let me quote a few of the good bits here in a way that can perhaps ameliorate the condescension:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most times and most places, I have a load of sympathy and even admiration for six-day creationists, &ldquo;young Earthers,&rdquo; and fundamentalists. As the debate between Ham and Nye unfolded, I found myself more and more disgusted with some of the self-styled &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; Christians performing their giggles at Ham for all the world to see.</p>
<p>There was something just a little ugly about all these Christians rushing up to their platforms, drawing attention to the sweat on their brow, putting a concerned look upon their faces, and proclaiming that fundamentalism is a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; error. And then when they were sure everyone was listening, lifted up their eyes heavenward to pray, &ldquo;God, I thank you that I am not like this mouth-breather Ken Ham.&rdquo; With a great urgency, but very little understanding of cosmology or the various theories of evolution, they recited their absolute fidelity to these theories. These anxious-to-please Christians were telling important truths, but in the spirit of a lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. This is exactly the attitude that my friend (and scientiest) Richard Okimoto decried to me on Twitter yesterday. (Richard: I hope this post doesn&rsquo;t make you sad.)</p>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To submit to the authority of science does not mean to place one&rsquo;s personal and irrevocable imprimatur on today&rsquo;s most supported theories. It simply means accepting the rational process of investigating claims about nature through rigorous observation and experimentation&hellip;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve always found those Christians who hold to six-day accounts of man&rsquo;s origin difficult to refute and even more difficult to despise. There is a certain strength and flexibility to their tautology. Further, even though they&rsquo;re wrong on the science, they are right about the things that really matter to the human heart and to human civilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he brings it home:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So <strong>I do not think that Ken Ham-style creationists should get to rewrite biology textbooks according to their very peculiar reading of Scripture. But I admire their bullheadedness. They &hellip; [are] trying to protect the big truths of Christianity</strong>: that God created the world, that we are dependent on him, that we owe him everything, and that he loves us even though we are sinful. In the world most of us inhabit, day to day, the world of lovers, wriggling kids, disease, war, and death, the sureness of God&rsquo;s love is relevant in a way that the details of early hominid fossils never will be, glorious as they are. Have some perspective, people.</p>
<p>In protecting that big truth of creation — that we are all made in God&rsquo;s image and all endowed with supreme dignity — fundamentalists zealously guard things that follow logically from that. Things like the commandment &ldquo;Thou shall not murder.&rdquo; &hellip; If Ken Ham is getting rich telling things he knows to be false, he&rsquo;s a shameless fraud. But the bulk of creation&rsquo;s fundamentalists are deeply sincere. And, better than that, they are willing to be, in St. Paul&rsquo;s words &ldquo;fools for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo; <strong>They do not live for the world&rsquo;s esteem. And so when the world next discovers a sophisticated ideology to get around &ldquo;Thou shall not murder,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d rather have one cussed fundie next to me than the whole army of eye-rolling Christians lining up to denounce him.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen and amen.</p>
<p>Is this fair? Honest? Kind and not patronizing? I hope so. If you&rsquo;re reading this as a young-earth creationist and you&rsquo;re miffed at what I&rsquo;ve quoted, please accept my apologies. I don&rsquo;t want to swipe, or sneer, or condescend. The nut that I get from both these posts is that, as Christians, we can agree to disagree on the age of the universe, and that there is noble, earnest desire to serve God and to love the truth of Scripture on both sides of the debate.</p>
<p>I want to be as passionate for the truth and unconcerned about what everyone else thinks as the YECs are, even if we disagree about the age of the rocks.</p>

			 <p>There was a well-publicized debate last night on this question: &ldquo;is creation a viable model of origins in today&rsquo;s modern scientific era&rdquo;? On the pro side was Ken Ham, the head of Answers in Genesis; on the con side was Bill Nye, popular TV &lsquo;science guy&rsquo;. Hosted at Ham&rsquo;s Creation Museum in Kentucky, the two men debated for two-and-a-half hours in front of a large audience, with a CNN reporter serving as moderator.</p>

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/z6kgvhG3AkI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The debate format included short opening statements, 30 minute presentations from each man, a series of short rebuttals, and then questions from the audience. For those of you who can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to watch the whole thing, I&rsquo;ll summarize the debate briefly and then share some thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<h3 id="hams-initial-presentation">Ham&rsquo;s Initial Presentation</h3>
<p>Ham, of course, espouses the Young Earth Creation (YEC) view. He explained that, in his view, the earth was created in six 24-hour days, and that the Biblical book of Genesis presents a historical record from the diving being who was present at creation. Ham distinguishes between &ldquo;observational science&rdquo;, which he defines as conclusions that we can derive using the scientific method of experimentation, from &ldquo;historical science&rdquo;, which he defines as drawing &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; conclusions about the past without having been there to observe it.</p>
<p>Ham claims that secular scientists, by using the same word for both &ldquo;observational&rdquo; and &ldquo;historical&rdquo; science, are muddying the waters; that they arbitrarily outlaw the supernatural, and as such are imposing a &ldquo;religion of naturalism/atheism&rdquo; on students.</p>
<p>Ham went to great lengths to show that Christians can be (and have been) good scientists, but that their science relates only to the &ldquo;observational&rdquo;, not the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; science.</p>
<h3 id="nyes-initial-presentation">Nye&rsquo;s Initial Presentation</h3>
<p>Nye framed the debate question a bit differently, making it about &ldquo;Ken Ham&rsquo;s creation model&rdquo; rather than addressing the formal question. (Was it a carefully-calculated strategy? Maybe. More on that in my commentary later.)</p>
<p>Nye made several points about the scientific evidence he sees for evolution and for an old universe, and noted several places where a literal reading of the Genesis creation and flood accounts is, in his opinion, highly unreasonable based on what we have observed about the universe.</p>
<p>As one example, Nye noted that Ham asserts that there were only about 7000 &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of creatures taken on the ark, but more than 15 million species identified today. If, per Ham&rsquo;s model, those 7000 &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; developed (via micro-evolution, cross-breeding, etc) into the 15 million species over a period of only 4000 years, Nye said we&rsquo;d expect to see 11 new species *every day* since then.</p>
<h3 id="points-from-hams-rebuttals">Points from Ham&rsquo;s rebuttals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ham was steadfast that reasoning backwards based on what we see now isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;science&rdquo;.</li>
<li>He provided quick anecdotal evidence about conflicting radio-carbon dates.</li>
<li>He said that the only infallible dating method is &ldquo;from someone who was there, who told us&rdquo; that the earth is only 6000 years old.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="points-from-nyes-rebuttals">Points from Nye&rsquo;s rebuttals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nye suggests that perhaps rock and tree layers slid to create odd dating stratum.</li>
<li>Says that it is troubling that Ham relies on the Bible, translated into English as the top authority on the natural laws.</li>
<li>If death was caused by sin, he asks, are fish sinners? If not, why do they die?</li>
<li>All we can do is look at the past. All study of astronomy is looking at the past.</li>
<li>He said there is no suggestion in the universe that natural laws have changed.</li>
<li>He asked why the Bible&rsquo;s text should be more respected than what we see in the natural world?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qa-from-the-audience">Q&amp;A From the Audience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nye notes that &ldquo;what was before the Big Bang?&rdquo; is a great mystery</li>
<li>Ham says there&rsquo;s a book that tells us. God created it.</li>
<li>Q to Ham: What evidence other than the Bible would point to creation? A: One human race, various &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of animals.</li>
<li>Q: what, if anything, would ever change your mind? Ham: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Christian.&rdquo; Starts from the premise that the Bible is God&rsquo;s word, and that you can check its veracity. No one will ever convince me that the Bible isn&rsquo;t true. Nye: scientific evidence would change my mind.</li>
<li>Q to Ham: if evidence did exist that the earth was older than 10k years, would you still believe in God, historical Jesus, Jesus Son of God? Ham: well, you can&rsquo;t prove that. it&rsquo;s an invalid hypothetical. If Christians believe in an old earth, they have a problem with the Bible. Nye: it&rsquo;s Ham&rsquo;s interpretation of the Bible vs. all scientific observation.</li>
<li>Q to Ham: can the Bible all be taken literally? Ham: what does &lsquo;literally&rsquo; mean? Take it &lsquo;naturally&rsquo;, based on genre. He then defined all of Genesis as history. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s really the word of God, there won&rsquo;t be any contradictions.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-the-debate">Thoughts on the debate</h2>
<p>OK, so that was a long summary. Sorry. Now a few thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong> on the debate itself: it was refreshing to see a debate that was even-handed and cordial. Compared to what we see most of the time in political debates today, this was a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> I wish they would&rsquo;ve spent some time focusing on how they chose to define &ldquo;science&rdquo;. Ham&rsquo;s view apparently refuses to make observations about the present and apply them to the past in ways that would contradict the YEC position. Nye pointed out in one rebuttal that Ham didn&rsquo;t have an answer for polar ice that scientists interpret as being 680,000 years old, but Ham didn&rsquo;t address the point at all.</p>
<p><strong>Third:</strong> This debate would&rsquo;ve been much more interesting and valuable for Christians if, instead of Mr. Nye, the Ham&rsquo;s opponent had been, say, Francis Collins (head of the National Institutes of Health, a Christian who believes in an old earth and evolutionary processes). That would&rsquo;ve framed the debate around young-earth vs. old-earth creation and the definition and use of science. By inviting Nye instead, Ham manages to frame the debate as a part of a greater Christianity vs. Atheism conflict, which I can only assume he hopes will rally the Christian troops and help bring more visitors to his financially-struggling Creation Museum.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth:</strong> I doubt anybody really had their opinion changed by the debate. Your opinion of who &ldquo;won&rdquo; and &ldquo;lost&rdquo; is probably dependent on who you supported going in. Neither debater wanted to allow for any middle ground. As <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geekgoesrogue/2014/02/hamonnye-final-thoughts-this-debate-personifies-whats-wrong-with-america/">Jonathan Ryan pointed out over on Patheos</a> both of them were determined to parrot their own position regardless of any &ldquo;debate&rdquo;. Frustrating.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>I have some thoughts on the creation/evolution topic more generally, but seeing as I&rsquo;m already past 1100 words I think I&rsquo;ll save that for another post.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday morning I was tweeting from the beginning of an industry committee meeting I&rsquo;m attending this week in Florida. I was griping a little bit about a presenter who was reading every line from his slides. This inspired a response from a friend of mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@cjhubbs: I&rsquo;ve come up with the wording of your next business card Christopher J Hubbs Sr Systems Engineer Please don&rsquo;t follow me on Twitter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand what Jason&rsquo;s getting at. Do I really want work people seeing my tweets about work, and for that matter connecting my work persona with my tweets about the rest of life?</p>
<p>Social media has changed things in the workplace, for sure. Back in the early days of Facebook and Twitter, employers' general attitudes were typically &ldquo;don&rsquo;t waste your time during work hours&rdquo;. Today, we have social media policies, are encouraged to &ldquo;like&rdquo; our employer on Facebook and to self-identify as an employee on Twitter. With all of those changes, though, many are still reticent to connect up in those ways.</p>
<p>My philosophy is a little bit different. When it comes to online life, I see two basic principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume that anything you put online will eventually be public knowledge.</li>
<li>I will try to not separate segments of my online life.</li>
<li>I will follow my employer&rsquo;s guidelines for social media use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me flesh out a bit what I mean by these.</p>
<h3 id="assume-that-anything-you-put-online-will-eventually-be-public-knowledge">Assume that anything you put online will eventually be public knowledge.</h3>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t mean here is that everything should automatically be posted to a global scope by default. When I post pictures of my kids to Facebook, I still limit their visibility to my friends.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s something that ought to stay private, or something that would be damaging to me or hurtful to others if it was made public, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be posted online. At all. Regardless of the intended distribution.</p>
<h3 id="i-will-try-to-not-separate-segments-of-my-online-life">I will try to not separate segments of my online life.</h3>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s valuable (and frankly, it&rsquo;s a lot easier) to not try to hide my personal life and non-work interests from my co-workers. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that I friend every co-worker on Facebook. But I use the same criteria for adding co-workers on Facebook as I do adding anybody else on Facebook. And what I&rsquo;ve found over the past several years is that being Facebook friends with these co-workers improves our working relationship as well as our personal friendship.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beneficial for folks to see an honest, unvarnished me; that I am a whole person juggling work, family, faith, and other life just like anyone else. I&rsquo;m Facebook friends with one previous boss and with my current boss (though we were FB friends as coworkers before he became my boss, which changes things a bit).</p>
<p>As time progresses and more and more of our workforce are active on social media, I expect these relational trends to continue. Social media usage will amplify your foolishness if you choose to behave that way. However, if it reflects a life that is wisely lived, presenting a holistic digital picture of life should serve to enhance relationships rather than hinder them.</p>
<p>It does make for occasional interesting moments, though.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a customer meeting with an Asian customer a few years back, when I exchanged business cards and introduced myself, there was a light of recognition in their eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Chris Hubbs! We visited your website!&rdquo; I guess this means they do their research, but I&rsquo;m also sort of curious what they thought about what they found on my site, given that I rarely blog about work but often ramble on theology and music. (As far as I can tell none of them decided to follow me on Twitter after the fact.)</p>
<h3 id="i-will-follow-my-employers-guidelines-for-social-media-use">I will follow my employer&rsquo;s guidelines for social media use.</h3>
<p>This one is a no-brainer. My employer has a good set of guidelines for use of social media, which essentially consist of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let it interfere with work&rdquo;, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak for the company&rdquo;, and &ldquo;remember you represent the company&rdquo;, and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be stupid&rdquo;. It means that I have a general note on my blog about page saying that the website contains my views, not those of my employer. (If I blog about something industry-related I will reiterate that disclaimer within the individual post.)</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Dave Eggers, in his recent novel <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EGMQIJ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EGMQIJ0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">The Circle</a></em>, envisions a social-tech-saturated future where the happy benefits of social sharing serve only to mask a scary dystopian scenario where the social mob mandates total &ldquo;clarity&rdquo; - the broadcast of every bit of a person&rsquo;s life for open viewing by anyone. While I understand what he&rsquo;s getting at, I don&rsquo;t think my current level of sharing and openness is too far down that path.</p>
<p>While I undoubtedly post a TMI tweet from time to time and end up sharing silly family anecdotes with co-workers who are FB friends, on the whole this model of openness is valuable for me. Not only does it enhance personal relationships, but by blatantly putting stuff online I think it leads the way for others who might not be as bold, and lets sympathetic readers know that they&rsquo;re not alone in their opinions and experiences. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that makes it worth it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tonight I went to the theater and saw *Her*, the recent movie from Spike Jonze. For those who might not be familiar with the film, here&rsquo;s the trailer:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/dJTU48_yghs">youtu.be/dJTU48_yg&hellip;</a></p>
<p>What an amazing film. So much to think about afterwards. How does our relationship with technology affect our relationships with people? Where do we find relational fulfillment? What is &ldquo;real&rdquo; in a relationship, anyway? Would a relationship that&rsquo;s exclusively about my happiness really make me happy in the long run?</p>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix gives a fantastic lead performance; Amy Adams is great as his friend, and Scarlett Johanssen plays a prominent role with her voice even though you never see her on screen. It&rsquo;s a beautiful film to look at, too - the use of colors, lights, and cityscapes is just lovely.</p>
<p>I came back to my hotel room tonight and turned on <em>Lost in Translation</em>, a 10-year-old movie also featuring Scarlett Johannsen and one that also leaves me with a raw inner yearning for relationship. The movies make a great pair.</p>
<p>My buddy Dan informed me tonight that the films are connected another way - Sofia Coppola, who wrote/directed <em>Lost in Translation</em> was married for a few years to Jonze, who wrote/directed <em>Her</em>. Maybe they&rsquo;re both processing their breakup in similar ways?</p>
<p>I find myself thankful tonight for films that make me think, and even more, perhaps, for films that make me <em>feel</em>; not just the adrenaline rush of an action thriller or the sadness of a weepy drama, but the complicated ache of friendship, yearning, and love.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had a passing thought in the midst of a blog post a few weeks ago that I want to explore a little more on its own. While <a href="/14/01/my-podcast-listening-circa-january-2014/">writing about my podcast listening</a>, I wondered this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an aside: it’s curious to me that while you’d find this kind of parenting discussion going on in the Christian blogosphere on mom blogs, you have to go to the secular arena to hear the dad’s perspective. What’s up with that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was sort of hoping that readers (of which I have at least a few) would chime in to let me know that I was just missing the Christian dad podcasts and blogs, but no. The only thing I heard in that regard was a note from my friend Mike noting that he&rsquo;d been considering starting up that sort of podcast himself.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of Googling today for Christian dad blogs, and didn&rsquo;t find too many. I came across one post from six months ago where someone on DaddyBlogger.com made a <a href="http://daddyblogger.com/faith/christian-dad-bloggers/">&ldquo;definitive guide of Christian Dad Bloggers&rdquo;</a>, but if you follow the links,(and there are only about 20 listed) the blogs are for the most part either very sports oriented or seem to be basic guy blogs rather than focusing on parenting in any substantive way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dadooda/2348222238/" title="i &lt;3 You by DaDooDa, on Flickr"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/4a4245c808.jpg" alt="i <3 You"></a></p>
<p>Sure, there are lots of podcasts and blogs out there targeted at men and fathers, but for the most part they&rsquo;re focused around things like <em>leadership</em>, or <em>legacy</em>, or <em>work/life balance</em>.</p>
<p>Now yeah, it&rsquo;s important for men to set a good example for their children, and to take responsibility for their spiritual development, and so on. Absolutely.</p>
<p>But why don&rsquo;t we see blog posts for dads about <em>other</em> aspects of parenting? Is a dad&rsquo;s realm of activity and advice limited to &ldquo;make sure the kids develop a correct theology&rdquo; and &ldquo;make sure you&rsquo;re around enough to go to their sports events&rdquo; and &ldquo;take your daughters on dates&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Where are the Christian dad blogs talking about effective bedtime strategies for preschoolers, or how to handle discipline in public situations (or private ones!), or dealing with toddlers who don&rsquo;t want to eat anything but hot dogs for weeks at a time, or how to not go insane when your four-year-old asks you to read the same My Little Pony book for bedtime for the seven-hundredth day in a row?</p>
<p>Or about encouraging healthy eating and physical activity, and about teaching kids how to enjoy entertainment in appropriate avenues and quantities? About how to make sure your kid doesn&rsquo;t grow up with his nose glued to an electronic device for 25 hours a day even when your inclination is to jump for the iPhone in your pocket every time it beeps?</p>
<p>How about practical advice for using time-outs and other ways of defusing situations where kids have just lost it and need time to reset attitudes rather than just escalating a battle of wills forever?</p>
<p>OK, I don&rsquo;t need to go on for another three paragraphs. And I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere along the way somebody has written a dad-related blog post on most of these subjects. But what I&rsquo;m asking today is why we don&rsquo;t see posts focused that way on a more regular basis?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got three daughters and have been a dad for almost 10 years now, and I can say with assurance that there should be a <strong>lot</strong> more to being a dad than just family devotions and soccer games. Just because some of the more home-related topics tend to the focus of moms rather than dads doesn&rsquo;t mean that they always <em>should</em> be.</p>
<p>So, my readers, any thoughts on why this disparity exists? Am I asking a question with such an obvious answer that I&rsquo;m stupid for asking? Is the disparity simply a product of the fact that moms spend more time with the kids than dads do?</p>
<p>If you read this and know of good Christian dad blogs or podcasts, leave a comment and let me know. I&rsquo;d love to find out that there are a bunch of them floating around that I just haven&rsquo;t located.</p>

<p>Check out the Wilkins Coffee ads here. The Wilkins character is clearly an early version of the puppet and voice that would become Kermit the Frog. In each ad Wilkins finds some way to bash on Wontkins because Wontkins doesn&rsquo;t drink the coffee. Edgy, but when it&rsquo;s puppets it&rsquo;s amazing what you can get away with.</p>

			 <p>I love this <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/01/16/and-so-it-begins/">confession from Catholic blogger Andrew Sullivan today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If by doctrine, you mean the core tenets of the Creed I recite at Mass by heart&hellip; then I do not favor any changes in doctrine. I believe in what I say. Sometimes, of course, it is hard to believe something that is beyond my real understanding. I’ve thought about, meditated on, puzzled over and marveled at the doctrine of the Incarnation, for example – for me, the most radical of all Christianity’s improbable claims. I believe in it until I can’t, at which point, I embrace a mystery – what Pascal called “the use and submission of reason.” But I am utterly unworthy – morally and intellectually – to offer any real critique of these mysteries; and because I feel and know the living presence of Jesus in my own life, because that presence seems to me both human and divine, and because Jesus has rescued me so many times from myself and from the world, I accept what I cannot understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sullivan is such a conundrum to me. British transplant to the States, gay Catholic, politically moderate, fairly serious about his theology, running a prolific blog that is equally delightful and at times infuriating. He went to a reader-supported format on his blog last year, and after a year of continuing to read it via the RSS feed and feeling like a moocher, I ponied up for a subscription this year.</p>
<p>Support the authors and creatives you appreciate, folks. Whether they&rsquo;re musicians, writers, designers, whatever. There are great folks out there creating great stuff, and our support goes a long way towards keeping them around.</p>

			 <p>Australian theology professor Ben Myers (<a href="http://twitter.com/faiththeology">@FaithTheology</a>) has been tweeting a fantastic series of 140-character commentaries on each book of the Bible, one tweet per book, delightfully tagged &ldquo;Canon Fodder&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While it may initially seem dismissive to describe each book of the Bible as a one-liner, on the contrary Myers' tweets are insightful, pithy summaries that provoke thought and also draw some smiles.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Kings: So, you really want a monarchy huh? Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you. 2 Kings: I told you so.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Psalms: The invention of antiphony: when my heart broke in two, I taught both parts to sing. Zephaniah: Cry out with horror, for I will sweep you from the earth. Cry out with joy, for I will sweep you into my arms. Acts: Proof of the resurrection: the powers of this world submit to a handkerchief on which an apostle has blown his nose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And probably my favorite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romans: Adam lost it, Christ found it, the Spirit gives it, faith holds it, creation yearns for it, death yields to it.</p>

			 <p>Growing up in the church as I did, and appreciating wordplay and humor, I&rsquo;m of course familiar with most of the Bible-related puns that float around such circles. For instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Who was the shortest man in the Bible? A: Bildad the Shuhite (shoe-height!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What&rsquo;s the only American state mentioned in the Bible?</p>
<p>A: Arkansas. You know, in Genesis &ldquo;Noah looked out of the ark and saw&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the ever classic</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Did you know that Honda was mentioned in the Bible?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, in Acts it says they were &ldquo;all together in one Accord&rdquo;!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I was listening to a recent episode of Nomad Podcast, though, and they in passing had a one that I hadn&rsquo;t heard before and so as a service to my loyal readers I will pass along.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Who was the greatest financier in the Bible?</p>
<p>A: Pharoah&rsquo;s daughter. She went to the Bank of the Nile and collected a profit (prophet)!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may groan now.</p>
<p>(I have a sister-in-law who calls these &ldquo;Hubbs jokes&rdquo;, and while I think the appreciation of cheap puns surely extends outside my family, I&rsquo;m proud to carry on the tradition.)</p>

			 <p>At the moment I&rsquo;m subscribed to 14 podcasts. I do all my podcast listening on my phone - mostly in the car or (during the summer months) while running or doing lawn work. (This has a nasty side-effect where I get a really backed-up queue in the winter months, but oh well.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of organization I&rsquo;ll group them into four rough categories: Tech, Entertainment, Theology, and Other. I&rsquo;ll address them in that order.</p>
<h3 id="tech">Tech</h3>
<p><a href="http://atp.fm"><strong>Accidental Tech Podcast</strong></a> - OK, surely the guys like Dan and Geof who are actually reading this are familiar with ATP. A weekly podcast around Apple tech nerdery, it features Marco Arment, John Siracusa, and Casey Liss. Lately they&rsquo;ve spent <em>far too much</em> time obsessing over the new Mac Pro - which I complained about on Twitter and <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/419135617956851712">Casey subsequently appreciated</a> - but usually it&rsquo;s an entertaining listen. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 90 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fiatlux.fm/pragmatic/"><strong>Pragmatic</strong></a> - This is a new one on my list; in fact, I&rsquo;ve only listened to the first half of the first (well, sixth) episode. It&rsquo;s a weekly podcast which purports to address the &ldquo;practical application&rdquo; of technology. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 60 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h3>
<p><a href="http://filmspotting.net"><strong>Filmspotting</strong></a> - A long-running public-radio-originated discussion of new films, punctuated with movie marathons highlighting overlooked titles from movie history. This is my first listen every week. Hosts Adam Kempenaar and Josh Larsen keep the discussion lively and provide many more good ideas for film watching than I will ever have time to keep up with. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 75 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://disasterpiecetheatre.com/"><strong>Disasterpiece Theatre</strong></a> - This one also has the virtue of being hosted by my friend-of-a-friend and sometimes acquaintance Stephen Granade. Imagine yourself in a Hollywood pitch room and pitching the most ridiculous movie ideas that (let&rsquo;s all admit) could probably get made. Stephen and co-host Alex White are quick- witted and hilarious. Enjoyable stuff. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 30 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theqandapodcast.com/"><strong>The Q&amp;A with Jeff Goldsmith</strong></a> - This one is a little more of a niche, I guess. Goldsmith interviews movie screenwriters about their story, writing methods, and experiences in the entertainment industry. I find it fascinating to hear storytellers talk about the craft of writing a good story. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 80 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wtfpod.com"><strong>WTF with Marc Maron</strong></a> - D-list comedian Marc Maron invites celebrities into his garage/studio and records hour-long interviews that range here, there, and everywhere. I almost gave up on this one until Don Chaffer reminded me that the 2-minute skip button could be put to good use. Skip the first 12 minutes of Maron plugging his comedy act and get straight to the interview. Maron asks really good questions, isn&rsquo;t afraid to ask about God, religion, and philosophy on life. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: The interview portion is usually 60-70 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="theology">Theology</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mortificationofspin.org"><strong>The Mortification of Spin</strong></a> - My buddy Mike set me on to this one a month ago. Comes out weekly or so, hosted by Carl Trueman. Besides winning the award for most cleverly-named podcast, this one does me good to remember that there are Calvinists on the internet who I can still agree with most of the time. <em>(I said <strong>on the internet</strong>, friends. There are lots of Calvinists I agree with most of the time among my personal friends and acquaintances.)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nomadpodcast.co.uk"><strong>Nomad</strong></a> - I think Randy linked this one a couple months back. Hosted by two British guys, this one is fairly emergent (is that still a thing?) or liberal evangelical. I don&rsquo;t find myself agreeing with them too much, but I find it a valuable listen because it helps me identify the places where liberal evangelicalism starts to go off the rails and needs to be dialed back. And they&rsquo;re right sometimes, too. (This may be the most backhanded podcast recommendation ever.) <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 65 minutes.</p>
<p>Then we come to two that have the distinction of featuring internet friends of mine:</p>
<p><a href="http://thepulpiteer.com"><strong>The Pulpiteer</strong></a> - this one features the sermons of pastor Andy Croel of Carson City United Methodist Church in Michigan. I dig Andy&rsquo;s sermons. He always points me to Jesus, has a good perspective on the text, and gives me something to chew on while keeping it under 30 minutes. Amazing. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 30 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.revmhj.com/tth"><strong>Trying Too Hard</strong></a> - This one also features Andy Croel in conversation with Arkansian UMC buddy Matthew Johnson. OK, I&rsquo;ll be honest: they&rsquo;ve only published two episodes so far and I haven&rsquo;t listened to either of them yet, but they&rsquo;re queued up on my phone and I&rsquo;m looking forward to them. That&rsquo;s worth something, right? <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 23 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<p><a href="http://dadsbeingdads.net/"><strong>Dads Being Dads</strong></a> - I&rsquo;ve only listened to part of one of these so far; can&rsquo;t remember who recommended them. But what I&rsquo;ve heard so far has been good. It&rsquo;s refreshing to hear dads talk about being dads. <em>(As an aside: it&rsquo;s curious to me that while you&rsquo;d find this kind of parenting discussion going on in the Christian blogosphere on mom blogs, you have to go to the secular arena to hear the dad&rsquo;s perspective. What&rsquo;s up with that? But that&rsquo;s a thought to be more fully formed in a separate blog post.)</em> <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 60 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/"><strong>Fresh Air</strong></a> - OK, you&rsquo;ve heard this show on NPR before, right? I don&rsquo;t really need to say any more than that. I like that they split the show segments into separate feed items, so I can delete the bits I&rsquo;m not interested in and keep the others. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: varies based on segment. 45 minutes max. Some as short as 6 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://maximumfun.org/shows/song-exploder"><strong>Song Exploder</strong></a> - I just subscribed to this one as well. It only has one episode so far. The goal is that they will interview a musician each time and have that musician play a track and then &ldquo;explode&rdquo; it - examining the different tracks, production, etc. This interests me as a musician, so I&rsquo;m subscribing for now. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://thethousandpeopleitriedtobe.com/"><strong>The Thousand People I Tried To Be</strong></a> - This one has a feed but no episodes yet. I&rsquo;m still waiting for my buddy Geof to edit and publish his first interview. I like the concept, and would enjoy it if he makes it a consistent thing. <strong>Average Duration</strong>: unknown.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I did something I&rsquo;ve never done before: I took a stack of books and sold them at the local used book store. This was a major step for me. I&rsquo;ve accumulated books for a long time - pretty sure I still have books on my shelves that I got in elementary school - and rarely let any of them go. My rationalization has been that someday maybe my kids will want to read them, or I&rsquo;ll strategically want to loan them out or give them away to friends.</p>
<p>But when I was looking for a book a few weeks ago I did another assessment of my burgeoning bookshelves and came to a realization: those things aren&rsquo;t likely to happen.</p>
<p>Sure, I&rsquo;ll keep some of them. I fully anticipate my girls will want to read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> at some point in the next decade. But <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>? Probably not so much.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the piles of theology texts. Some floating around from college. Some freebies I got and reviewed on the blog. Some were gifts. Some I agree with a lot less today than I did when I bought them. Many I&rsquo;d be hard pressed to recommend or want to gift.</p>
<p>So I sold them.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t get much - basically garage sale prices, but where you just carry in a bag and walk out 10 minutes later with money. Beats the heck out of having to hold a garage sale and hoping the right buyer shows up.</p>
<p>I managed to clean out one whole shelf. That&rsquo;s enough room to move my recently-read pile from the top of my dresser down to the shelves. Then I can start attacking the to-read pile that sits next to my bed.</p>
<p>I think this is the year I&rsquo;m going to fully embrace accumulating ebooks instead of hard copies. I like the ability to read, easily highlight and share text, and archive them someplace smaller than the dozens of feet of shelf space occupying my basement.</p>
<p>You know, I converted from CD buying to MP3 buying a couple years ago. I guess this is the next logical progression.</p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s my one year-end post: a little summary of what I read this year. I&rsquo;m not gonna list &lsquo;em all - you can go check out <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101?shelf=2013-reads">the list on Goodreads</a> if you&rsquo;re really interested - but I&rsquo;ll include some highlights.</p>
<p>I finished 57 books this year - about average for me over the past several years - and 27 of them were non-fiction, which is as close to fiction/non-fiction parity as I&rsquo;ve ever gotten before. My non-fiction was mostly theology this year, which reminds me I need to pick up some more history, biographies, and the like in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Top Non-Fiction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830837655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0830837655&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power</a></em> by Andy Crouch</li>

</ul>
<p>I really need to write a full review post on <em>Playing God</em>. It was probably my favorite of the year, and the one that I then bought two copies of to give as Christmas gifts. I&rsquo;m feeling a little bit better about my theological variety, too - it isn&rsquo;t just all Anglicans on my list this year!</p>
<p><strong>Top Fiction</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>It feels like a cheat to list Robinson&rsquo;s book here, since she uses the fictional narrative to drive home a bunch of theological and philosophical points, but hey, it&rsquo;s good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>The worst</strong> I&rsquo;ve gotten better at just putting books down if they seem like clunkers, so I have just a single one-star reviewed book on my list this year: <em>The Panther</em> by Nelson DeMille. Here&rsquo;s what I wrote on Goodreads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plot is thinner than thin. Hundreds of pages and nothing happens except we get a tour of Yemen and page after page of insufferable narrative. It&rsquo;s as if Mr DeMille had a quota of smart-ass internal dialog per page that he had to fill. If you cut out half of it, the book would shorten by 20% and still be just as boring.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ashamed I wasted as much time on this one as I did. Avoid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Plans for 2014</strong> I&rsquo;m likely to always be a theology, politics, and sci-fi geek, but I really would like to read some more history, some classic literature, and maybe even a little poetry. Hit me up if you have recommendations!</p>

			 <p>We were looking for a family movie tonight and Netflix recommended <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485601/">The Secret of Kells</a>. I had only a vague familiarity with the movie, but the reviews and info looked good, so we gave it a go. It turned out to be a beautiful little movie, in a unique 2-d animated style, relating a story around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells">Book of Kells</a>, an illuminated copy of the four Gospels created by Celtic monks in the 7th century. Neat movie.</p>
<p>That took us to the <a href="http://www.bookofkells.com/">Book of Kells iPad application</a>, which I had gotten months ago when it was a freebie but had never really looked at. The girls were suddenly intent to look at the pictures, try to understand the text (whoops! it&rsquo;s Latin!) and KP (age 4) even pulled out a Bible then to find the book of John after she found out it was part of the Book.</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t imagine anybody saying things much better than <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/gospeldrivenchurch/2013/12/18/re-mark-driscoll/">Jared Wilson did today over on The Gospel Coalition</a>. Bits and pieces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of people who want Mark Driscoll to fail and fall. I am not one of them. I love and respect Pastor Mark&hellip; I want to repeat: I do not want Pastor Mark to fail and fall. <em>I just want him to walk in step with the truth of the gospel.</em> &hellip; I would “confront” him to his face if I could. Even though this is not a Matthew 18 situation, and Pastor Mark has not sinned against me personally, last week I tried to contact him privately through the two avenues available to me, but I received no response. I did not demand or even expect one. &hellip; But I have an obligation to Pastor Mark&hellip; I feel as though I owe it to him to speak thusly to him. Or <em>about</em> him, as the case may be, since I do not want to presume he would read this. &hellip; And I feel I have an obligation to the young men coming up into ministry, exploring the gospel-centered paradigm, learning and studying and practicing missional ministry wherever God has called them. <strong>I don’t want them to think the way to lead is to insulate from critique, ignore challenges, and adapt to some echo chamber of mutual admiration.</strong> I don’t want young men looking up to men like Mark or listening to lesser voices like my own to think gospel-centered ministry means passivity and silence in the face of obvious needs or, worse, aggression in the area of reputation, dominance and swagger in leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really appreciate Jared&rsquo;s point here. I know several men who have come up admiring and imitating Mark Driscoll, and while their gospel proclamation is great, they need to have other voices telling them that &ldquo;aggression in the area of reputation, dominance and swagger&rdquo; is not something desirable to imitate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not merely about lazing writing&hellip; It’s about what this one latest incident in the accumulating evidence of Pastor Mark’s empire-building says to us, his brothers and his customers&hellip; This latest episode is just the latest example indicating an evident lack of accountability and personal responsibility. <strong>All along, I’ve trusted that Pastor Mark had the right people around him, speaking the hard truths to him. I assumed those voices were there and authorized by him to keep him honest. I no longer believe this.</strong><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Pastor Mark, if you’re reading this — <strong>you are losing us</strong>. Forget about the “haters.” We ain’t them. We are the ones who love you, who want to see you succeed and prevail. And we won’t stop, no matter what tribe you’re in or which conference stage you take. But <strong>we want you to take responsibility for your actions and your attitude</strong>. It does not commend grace. We want you to walk in repentance. We want you to seek the way of Christ in more humility, to drop the image and the posturing, and remind us of what drew us to you in the first place: the fame of Christ’s name, not the protection of your own. What would the truth of the gospel have you do? What would adorn the gospel? <strong>What would make Jesus look big?</strong> I believe it would a reversal of the trajectory of pride you have been on. I’m asking you to turn around and show us why we were so drawn to you in the beginning. I’m asking you to show us Jesus. He has become lost in your shadow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jared provides a great example and challenge to me and others who appreciate the gospel-centered history of Mark Driscoll&rsquo;s preaching but who are concerned by his recent direction. It&rsquo;s worth reading <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/gospeldrivenchurch/2013/12/18/re-mark-driscoll/">the whole thing</a>.</p>

			 <p>Professor and pastor <a href="http://www.reclaimingthemission.com/?p=4216">David Fitch has some powerful words on the Driscoll plagiarism topic today</a>, and more broadly on celebrity leadership in evangelical churches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so the question really is <em>NOT</em> did Driscoll plagiarize or not (he did). It is, <strong>why doesn’t Mark Driscoll simply repent?</strong> Why doesn’t he just go before his congregation, lie prostate [sic] on the ‘stage’ and confess his sins of plagiarism, greed, trying to do too much publishing too fast, and what he will do to rectify and make the situation whole. It’s what us Christians do? Of course this too could be used ideologically. But at least this would be the actual practice of the Christian faith (Matt 18:15-20, James 5:16) one step removed from managing the ideological factors (his public image, his sales etc.).</p>
<p>Instead Driscoll’s silence in this regard reveals that there is ideology at work. His clear avoidance of one of the most basic practices of the Christian life and the continuing charades surrounding him, the publishers and the lawyers to avoid dealing with the lies, illustrate how far the Driscoll’s book and leadership has been removed above the actual practice of on-the-ground Christian life in the form of a celebrity pastor, and <strong>has become a product to be sold, an image to be upheld</strong>. This is not Christianity, this is ideology, and (for all the reasons mentioned above) I believe cannot lead our churches anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Then Fitch expands the discussion to the broader evangelical church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My observation is simple. Once Christianity/church devolves into an ideology it ceases being an authentic embodiment of God’s Triune work in the world. It becomes a product. It works off antagonism (or lack) as opposed to being the overflowing of abundance of God’s work into the world&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>Celebrity leadership is the death knell of the evangelical church in America.</strong> It’s killing us. And so I believe it’s of utmost importance that everyone under the age of 35 reject celebrity leadership. Realize that <strong>once beliefs, products, preaching, leadership is extracted from the local life of the local concretely engaged church, it tends to quickly devolve into ideology</strong>. And we then are just a short period away from the death of that church in a swirl of inevitable contradictions, hypocrisy and moral failures that inevitably attend celebrity leadership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fitch nails it in that last paragraph. Keep things local and engaged. As I said last week: <a href="/13/12/called-to-be-faithful-not-famous/" title="Called to be faithful, not famous">we are called to be faithful, not famous</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll start the blog post with a disclaimer, because heck, why not?</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not for a second going to claim that I have anything new or profound to say about the little Mark Driscoll plagiarism brouhaha that&rsquo;s been appearing (and disappearing) throughout the blogosphere over the past couple weeks. Much has been said, more clearly than I could, by many others. But recognizing that there are a handful of people who might read my post but won&rsquo;t get to the other stories, and because I&rsquo;m a little bit bored on a business trip and found a quote in a book I&rsquo;m reading that I want to share, I&rsquo;m writing anyway.</em></p>
<p><strong>OK, so now that <em>that&rsquo;s</em> over with&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the Driscoll plagiarism fiasco and want to know more, I&rsquo;d refer you to the excellent reporting by <a href="http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/">Jonathan Merritt</a> for Religion News Service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nov 22, 2013: <a href="http://jonathanmerritt.religionnews.com/2013/11/22/mark-driscoll-accused-plagiarism-radio-host/">Mark Driscoll accused of plagiarism by radio host</a></li>

</ul>
<p>(There&rsquo;s also been some good discussion on watchblogs like <a href="http://thewartburgwatch.com/">The Wartburg Watch</a> and <a href="http://spiritualsoundingboard.com/">Spiritual Sounding Board</a>.)</p>
<p>My short synopsis: <em>I tried to write a short synopsis and it ended up being two paragraphs. I guess I can&rsquo;t write a short synopsis, sorry. OK, I&rsquo;ll try once more.</em> Basically evangelical megachurch pastor Mark Driscoll was accused of plagiarism, including one case that seemed pretty obvious. After a week of eerie silence from Driscoll and his people, the radio host who had been pressing the case suddenly removed everything about it from her website and gave an on-air apology to Driscoll. Allegations were made by the radio host&rsquo;s assistant producer that this was the result of an &ldquo;evangelical celebrity machine&rdquo;, but the radio host refuses to comment.</p>
<p><strong>I ran across two things today that merit linking in to this story.</strong></p>
<p>First is a blog post by the ornery pastor, author, and blogger Douglas Wilson. I&rsquo;ll be honest: I thought it&rsquo;d be a cold day in hell before I would agree wholeheartedly with a Wilson post. But today he published <a href="http://dougwils.com/s7-engaging-the-culture/mark-driscoll-and-problems-of-citation.html">a ((quite) lengthy) bit on the topic</a> that spoke clearly and fairly about all the key issues concerned: plagiarism, the use of ghost writers, the responsibility of having your name on the cover of the book, and the inevitable push to manufacture scandal whether one exists or not. Highly recommended reading.</p>
<p><em>As an aside: I don&rsquo;t often embrace Wilson&rsquo;s arguments or his style, but how can you not love a guy who starts a piece like this:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have much to say about the ruckus these last few weeks concerning the allegation of plagiarism by Mark Driscoll, an allegation that was made by Janet Mefferd, and then subsequently withdrawn by her. Not having much to say, I intend therefore to not say it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>and then goes on to write more than 4000 words?</em></p>
<p>The last thing I want to highlight in this post is a quote from Andy Crouch&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0830837655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0830837655&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power</a></em>. I started into it on a flight this afternoon, and while I&rsquo;m only 30% in, I can already recommend it. (At least for that 30% - here&rsquo;s hoping the last 70% is equally awesome and I can recommend the whole thing by the end of the week.) Toward the end of Chapter 5, Crouch examines the old story of the Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes, and draws out how it relates to those in power. (This isn&rsquo;t anything <em>new</em>, but said really well&hellip;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power, even up to the absolute power of an emperor, is invested in ordinary human beings&hellip; who underneath even the most exquisite trappings, or for that matter armed with the most fearsome technology, are naked mortals. <strong>The maintenance of power, then, comes not from any extraordinary quality in the powerful themselves, but from the consent and continual reaffirmation of those around them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just over 30 minutes worth of music, all piano versions of traditional Christmas carols.

The perfectionist part of me wishes I had another 80 hours to really refine and polish the arrangements and recordings; the engineer in me has declared &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. The engineer won the debate this time.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://wenatcheethehatchet.blogspot.com/2013/12/jeff-bettger-no-longer-pastor-at-mars.html">Wenatchee the Hatchet pointed me</a> this morning to <a href="http://www.locustnhoney.com/?p=1148">a devotional post</a> written by Jeff Bettger, who <a href="http://wenatcheethehatchet.blogspot.com/2013/12/jeff-bettger-no-longer-pastor-at-mars.html">up until recently</a> was Arts Pastor at Mars Hill Church in Seattle.</p>
<p>It begins with a good meditation on Ephesians 5, where Paul says that works of darkness should be brought to light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), 10 and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. 12 For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. 13 But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, 14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Ephesians 5:8 - 14 (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bettger then goes on to hint at practices going on at Mars Hill that he believes should be brought to light. More of a personal confessional than an accusation and calling to account, it still raises some serious issues. Some bits and pieces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a mega church background for the last 16 years I have witnessed first hand the tyranny of injustice done in the name of God. Layoffs during Christmas, weeks after new children are born and first homes purchased. The use of tithe money to purchase books at retail cost in order to build a mans platform and make the NY times best seller lists. All with the name of God stamped on it, and self justified because the rest of the business world has those kinds of practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What I see Paul telling us here in this passage is to expose injustice, worldly thinking, business pragmatism, immorality&hellip; These shady mega church practices are all impure and covetous, and are hidden in the darkness by people calling themselves “Christian professionals” or pastors. They say that it would be unhelpful for the body to know such information. They say it would be gossip and if you haven’t experienced it directly but only heard second hand than it is hearsay and gossip to bring into the light. That is a lie from the pits of hell that gives justification to keep the truth hidden and the ones committing the injustice from true repentance.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We get so amped up on fighting sexual immorality we forget all that Paul is actually saying in this section of scripture. Any part of our life that needs to be hidden for whatever reason is not in the light, and should be exposed. Human politics and cunning are not an out-flowing of the Gospel but rather a system built by human hands for human ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>So why am I posting this here? Partly because I have friends and family who are involved in Acts 29 churches and who I hope could at least become aware of some of the tactics that get used with the excuse that everybody&rsquo;s doing it and that the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>But also because we <em>all</em> need to be keenly aware in our own hearts, in our own lives, in our own churches, how these attitudes can sneak in. We are called to be peaceable and humble, not defensive and self-justifying. To be faithful, not famous. To make disciples, not empires.</p>
<p>True Gospel success is demonstrated in the tender, repentant heart, not in the size of our Sunday congregation or the success of our latest book.</p>
<p>If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us, and His grace abounds to us. If we try to hide them and justify them in the name of building the church and spreading the Gospel, we are only deceiving ourselves and setting ourselves up for a bigger fall, whether that&rsquo;s in a megachurch in Seattle or a little church in Iowa.</p>
<p>Pastor Jeff showed humility and leadership with <a href="http://www.locustnhoney.com/?p=1148">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>, and we should commend his humility and repentance as an example to be followed.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday <a href="/13/12/dave-ramsey-sacred-cow/">I wrote about the need to be willing to accept truth (and discard error) from wherever we find it</a>, not just when it&rsquo;s from our favorites (or least-favorites). A friend on Facebook noted in a comment on my post that she has lately been &ldquo;tuning out&rdquo; certain bloggers whom she has found repeatedly irritating or unhelpful.</p>
<p>As negative as I first thought it sounded, in truth I resemble that remark. It wasn&rsquo;t that many months ago that I asked some friends for their opinions on whether I should keep certain websites in my regular reading list, even if they were irritants, or whether it was appropriate to just delete them if they were consistently making me crazy.</p>
<p>So after writing yesterday&rsquo;s post I find myself in a bit of a quandary. How do I go about learning from even those people who I often disagree with if I&rsquo;m going to stop reading them at all?</p>
<p><strong>Well, I&rsquo;m not gonna read <em>everybody</em></strong></p>
<p>I should acknowledge that there are a certain set of folks who I just won&rsquo;t read, because the value-to-noise ratio is so small that it&rsquo;s just not worth it. Sorry, 9/11 truthers. Sorry, Mr. Third Eagle of the Apocalypse. There&rsquo;s only so much time in the day.</p>
<p><strong>In Which I Choose Not to Name Names</strong></p>
<p>Part of me really wants to list a bunch of names of bloggers that I need to consider re-adding to my feed reader. But all that would do would provoke reactions from folks who <em>like</em> the folks I&rsquo;ve deleted, and the point of this post isn&rsquo;t to get into arguments about who&rsquo;s worth reading and who&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>More important is deciding to read, and to have the humility to read and at least consider the views of those even who I think I&rsquo;m fairly likely to disagree with. This accomplishes several things. It hones my critical thinking skills. It broadens my general knowledge of the arguments that are out there on any given topic. It provides me the opportunity to humbly understand that I might be wrong on certain points, and to correct my own thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>There may still be times when some author is driving me crazy. Am I wrong to delete their feed and not read them for a while? Probably not. But more important than what I&rsquo;m reading is why I&rsquo;m reacting so strongly. If I&rsquo;m reacting because an author truly isn&rsquo;t making sense on a regular basis, maybe I really should delete them. If I&rsquo;m reacting because I don&rsquo;t like what&rsquo;s being said, why am I reacting?</p>
<p>There are millions of words written every day that I disagree with. Why do those particular words make me react? What does that reflect about my heart, thoughts, and intentions? Once I get that settled I&rsquo;ll know better what to do with that pesky blog subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Draw your own conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>My conclusion <strong>for myself</strong> is that I should add a few feeds back to my reader. (Your conclusion for yourself might be different.) Then, if I still have a strong reaction, I&rsquo;ll work to understand why I have that reaction. I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll learn more about my personal biases and blind spots. God knows I have plenty to learn.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this week I posted a link on my Facebook feed: <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/30/what-dave-ramsey-gets-wrong-about-poverty/">&ldquo;What Dave Ramsey Gets Wrong about Poverty&rdquo;</a> - an opinion column by <a href="http://www.rachelheldevans.com">Rachel Held Evans</a>. Little did I know the intensity of response it would receive.</p>
<p>Rachel is a polarizing figure among the evangelical blogging public these days. A progressive woman who isn&rsquo;t afraid to speak her piece, she&rsquo;s gained a significant audience in the past year or two. (This is not the first time she&rsquo;s had a guest piece on CNN.com.) At the risk of over-simplifying her piece (which I recommend reading in its entirety), her main points were these:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Much of what Ramsey teaches is sound, helpful advice, particularly for middle-class Americans struggling with mounting credit card bills.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Ramsey&rsquo;s &ldquo;views on poverty are neither informed nor biblical&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A recent piece on Ramsey&rsquo;s website &ldquo;confused correlation with causation here by suggesting that [certain] habits make people rich or poor&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Ramsey’s perceived “direct correlation” between faith and wealth should be more troubling than his other confused correlations, for it flirts with what Christians refer to as the prosperity gospel, the teaching that God rewards faithfulness with wealth.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Ramsey &ldquo;glosses over the reality that economic injustice is not, in fact, limited to the developing world but plagues our own country as well.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;People are poor for a lot of reasons, and choice is certainly a factor, but categorically blaming poverty on lack of faith or lack of initiative is not only uninformed, it’s unbiblical.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Now maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but these points seem fairly obvious and valid. So I was more than a little surprised at the vehemence of negative responses to my link and on the subsequent re-sharings of a few of my friends. It would appear that, among American evangelical circles these days, criticizing Dave Ramsey on anything is nearly as dangerous as commending President Obama for anything.</p>
<p>What is more striking, though, is the common thread I saw in the negative responses. The assertions were all along the lines of &ldquo;I think she misquoted Dave&rdquo; (though no one provided any specifics), and &ldquo;Dave&rsquo;s system worked for me, so people shouldn&rsquo;t criticize him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here we see a scary bit of illogic that is far too common these days - the immediate defense of the person under critique without seemingly no consideration of the points that were actually made. No one tried to argue that Ramsey&rsquo;s views of poverty were biblical, or that his correlations of faith and wealth were incorrect, or that systemic economic injustice is not an issue. All they said was &ldquo;it worked for me!&rdquo;, which, incidentally, was the first thing Ms. Evans acknowledged in her column.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve been guilty of this tendency myself often enough. A critique of something or someone I generally support feels like an attack on that person, which in turn I take as an attack on me, and my first response isn&rsquo;t a thoughtful, reasoned response, but instead a knee-jerk reaction.</p>
<p><strong>This has got to stop.</strong></p>
<p>We as American evangelicals have no hope of actually solving some of the systemic problems in our church and our country if we&rsquo;re unwilling to examine, critique, and correct even our most popular sacred cows.</p>
<p>We must have wise awareness of the motivations of those who are teaching and selling to us, even when that message is clothed in the &ldquo;safe&rdquo; garb of evangelical Christian vocabulary.</p>
<p>We must understand that, outside of Jesus, no teacher is always right, and almost no teacher is always wrong. This will free us to wrestle with uncomfortable truths. When we do we will find surprising agreement with those whom we previously considered adversaries. We will also have the (very healthy) realization that even our most revered evangelical heroes are fallible humans just like us.</p>
<p>We must embrace God&rsquo;s truth through whatever channels it comes to us. (Yes, that means I&rsquo;m likely to write another post with quotes from the Pope&rsquo;s latest exhortation.) We similarly need to be willing to discard error wherever we find it, even when we find it in those who we like and have found helpful.</p>
<p>Learn. Think. Act. Grow. Learn more. Think more. Humbly turn. Grow more.</p>
<p>This is our calling as followers of Jesus Christ.</p>

It&rsquo;s a long read - more a book than a web page, about 50,000 words - and I only got about 10% of the way through it at lunch today. However, there is a ton of good stuff even in that first 10%. A few striking quotes (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How good it feels to come back to him whenever we are lost! Let me say this once more: <strong>God never tires of forgiving us; we are the ones who tire of seeking his mercy.</strong> Christ, who told us to forgive one another “seventy times seven” (Mt 18:22) has given us his example: he has forgiven us seventy times seven. Time and time again he bears us on his shoulders. No one can strip us of the dignity bestowed upon us by this boundless and unfailing love. With a tenderness which never disappoints, but is always capable of restoring our joy, he makes it possible for us to lift up our heads and to start anew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a great reminder. Then there&rsquo;s this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are Christians whose lives seem like Lent without Easter. I realize of course that joy is not expressed the same way at all times in life, especially at moments of great difficulty. Joy adapts and changes, but it always endures, even as a flicker of light born of our personal certainty that, when everything is said and done, we are infinitely loved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When everything is said and done, we are infinitely loved.&rdquo; I need that reminder. Regularly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every activity of evangelization, the primacy always belongs to God, who has called us to cooperate with him and who leads us on by by the power of his Spirit&hellip; The life of the Church should always reveal clearly that God takes the initiative, that “he has loved us first” (1 Jn 4:19) and that he alone “gives the growth” (1 Cor 3:7). This conviction enables us to maintain a spirit of joy in the midst of a task so demanding and challenging that it engages our entire life. God asks everything of us, yet at the same time he offers everything to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God takes the initiative, God gives the growth, God asks everything of us and at the same time offers everything to us. Wow.</p>
<p>And one last one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God’s word is unpredictable in its power. The Gospel speaks of a seed which, once sown, grows by itself, even as the farmer sleeps (Mk 4:26-29). The Church has to accept <strong>this unruly freedom of the word</strong>, which accomplishes what it wills in ways that surpass our calculations and ways of thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna take me a while to get through the whole thing, but I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s definitely worth a read.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/11/25/jim-belcher-in.html">Jim Belcher, &#34;In Search of Deep Faith&#34;</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/11/25/jim-belcher-in.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-11-25 21:25:23 -0500">Nov 25, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I first became acquainted with author Jim Belcher back in 2009 when I read <em>Deep Church</em>. It appears I didn&rsquo;t review it here on the blog, but <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/74128016">my Goodreads review</a> gave it four stars: solid but not revolutionary. Now Belcher is back, with <em>In Search of Deep Faith</em>.</p>
<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen bits and pieces of this book already, having followed Belcher on Twitter for the past few years. <em>In Search of Deep Faith</em> reads like a travel journal crossed with <em>Foxe&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs</em>, as Belcher recounts his family&rsquo;s adventures through several months of &ldquo;pilgrimage&rdquo; in Europe. Belcher, his wife and four pre-teen children spent several months in Oxford, England, where he was a visiting scholar at the university there. They then spent time exploring European sites that were notable because of the saints who had lived there.</p>
<p>Belcher&rsquo;s chapters bounce back and forth as he shares his family&rsquo;s adventures in finding and exploring the locations - from Corrie Ten Boom&rsquo;s house in Holland, to C. S. Lewis' home in Oxford, to a fruitless search for the location of Bonhoeffer&rsquo;s hidden seminary - and then interspersing the stories of these saints, with an emphasis on how their deep faith led them to be devoted even during times of crisis and under threat of death.</p>
<p>Belcher&rsquo;s concern in this memoir seems not primarily for his own spiritual health, but for that of his young children. He reminds us (several times) of studies telling us that children with shallow faith roots will abandon their faith in adulthood. How, Belcher wonders, can he inspire the faith and spiritual understanding that will allow his children to remain firm in their faith throughout their lives?</p>
<p><em>In Search of Deep Faith</em> is an entertaining read. Most readers will find at least one of the historical faith stories to be new to them - the full story of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer was particularly interesting to me - and Belcher drives the reader to reflection on the health of one&rsquo;s own faith.</p>
<p>[caption width=&ldquo;640&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo;]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d8d7096b47.jpg" alt=""></a> Cranmer burned at the stake[/caption]</p>
<p>My one big gripe with the book is Belcher&rsquo;s style of driving his argument via what I&rsquo;m assuming must be invented dialogue. Sure, some of the conversations on his trip probably happened as they are written, but even though page after page of his book is filled with quoted dialog (&quot;&lsquo;why do you think he did that?&rsquo;, my wife asked.&quot;), either he provided a script for his family to read their questions from, or he&rsquo;s putting words in their mouths later as a device to move his arguments along. And while literature has been using the forced question-and-answer format at least since Plato did it in <em>The Republic</em>, after too many chapters of it from Belcher it just feels contrived.</p>
<p>In spite of that gripe I&rsquo;d still recommend reading this one if you think you&rsquo;re at all interested. Style aside, it&rsquo;s an encouraging and educational read.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: InterVarsity Press provided me a free ebook copy of</em> In Search of Deep Faith <em>in return for posting a review here and at Amazon.com. The contents of the review are mine alone.</em></p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t always find myself warmed by the writings of Charles Spurgeon, but my friend Michael Terry sent me this bit yesterday, to which I can only give a hearty Amen!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have seen such a one limping about with a long doctrinal leg, but a very short emotional leg. It is a horrible thing for a man to be so doctrinal that he can speak coolly of the doom of the wicked, so that, if he does not actually praise God for it, it costs him no anguish of heart to think of the ruin of millions of our race. This is horrible!<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I hate to hear the terrors of the Lord proclaimed by men whose hard visages, harsh tones, and unfeeling spirit betray a sort of doctrinal desiccation: all the milk of human kindness is dried out of them. Having no feeling himself, such a preacher creates none, and the people sit and listen while he keeps to dry, lifeless statements, until they come to value him for being &ldquo;sound&rdquo;, and they themselves come to be sound, too; and I need not add, sound asleep also, or what life they have is spent in sniffing out heresy, and making earnest men offenders for a word. Into this spirit may we never be baptized!<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Whatever I believe, or do not believe, the command to love my neighbour as myself still retains its claim upon me, and God forbid that any views or opinions should so contract my soul, and harden my heart as to make me forget this law of love! The love of God is first, but this by no means lessens the obligation of love to man; in fact, the first command includes the second. We are to seek our neighbour&rsquo;s conversion because we love him, and we are to speak to him in loving terms God&rsquo;s loving gospel, because our heart desires his eternal good.</p>

			 <p>I bought two tickets to a big rock-and-roll show.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an Arcade Fire fan for a few years now, but have never seen them in person. This morning their advance ticket sale went live for their 2014 tour, and after a quick consultation with Becky, I bought a pair.</p>
<p>Minneapolis. March 8. Happy early birthday to me!</p>
<p>And yeah, I bought General Admission Floor tickets. Because if you&rsquo;re gonna go to a big show, why do you want a chair in a fixed location if you can instead be down on the floor?</p>
<p>Also: many thanks to Becky for being agreeable. She&rsquo;s not a huge Arcade Fire fan, and not always one for big shows. Hopefully she&rsquo;ll enjoy this one.</p>

			 <p>Just a quick note here today to say Happy Birthday to my dear mother. (I&rsquo;ll call you later on today, Mom!)</p>
<p>Remembering her long annoyance on this day many years ago when us kids ran into church on a Wednesday night and breathlessly announced that it was Mom&rsquo;s birthday and she was turning 40!, I&rsquo;ll not mention her age here. (Maybe I can safely say is that while that event was on her 40th birthday, she and Dad have now surpassed their 40th anniversary.)</p>
<p>Mom invested the bulk of her life to raise and educate her five children, and remains an example of faithfulness, graciousness, and consistency to us all.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, Mom, and God&rsquo;s blessings on you for this next year and many more to come.</p>

			 <p>One of the enjoyable things about going on business trips to various locations is the chance to get to do some running in locations I don&rsquo;t usually get to see. I love that running gives you a perspective on a place that you don&rsquo;t get from just driving past in your car, and when you can get that perspective on someplace new, that&rsquo;s a treat.</p>
<p>A couple of past favorites include a run around Washington, DC, and another one in Ottawa, Ontario with a short excursion into Quebec. Tonight, though, I got to do my best <em>Chariots of Fire</em> impression on the beach outside of Melbourne, Florida. Can&rsquo;t beat the sound of waves crashing on the shore as accompianament for your run.</p>
<p>I had to cut the run short because it was getting dark fast, but it was a great run; will definitely have to hit the beach this way again on my next trip to Florida.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Calvinist arrives at St. Peter’s gates and sees that there are two queues going in. One is marked “predestined,” and the other is marked “free will.” Being the card-carrying Calvinist that he is, he strolls on over to the predestined queue. After several moments an angel asks him, “Why are you in this line?” He replies, “Because I chose it.” The angel looks surprised, “Well, if you ‘chose’ it, then you should be in the free will line.” So our Calvinist, now slightly miffed, obediently wanders over to the free will line. Again, after a few minutes, another angel asks him, “Why are you in this line?” He sullenly replies, “Someone made me come here.”</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/10/31/some-thoughts-on.html">Some thoughts on the FAA&#39;s decision to allow use of phones/tablets on airplanes from gate to gate</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/10/31/some-thoughts-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-10-31 19:14:41 -0500">Oct 31, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/travel/faa-portable-electronic-devices/">FAA announced today</a> that it is directing airlines to enact policy that will allow passengers to use their mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc) from gate to gate - a welcome change for travelers who are used to the &ldquo;turn everything completely off until we get above 10,000 feet&rdquo; announcement at the beginning of every flight.</p>
<p>So my first thought comes as a frequent traveler on this nation&rsquo;s airlines, and I can summarize it like this:</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s about time.</strong></p>
<p>But what about the concerns over device usage? The FAA has said for years that they thought it was possible that having phones turned on during takeoff and landing could affect the aircraft. Is that really not the case?</p>
<p>Now, before I start offering opinions, I should explain that I have a little bit of background on this topic. I work for a company that designs and manufactures avionics equipment for big (and small) aircraft. We build things like displays, autopilots, communications radios, and GPSs for just about every aircraft manufacturer you could name. I work in our Certification Department. While my specialty is software certification, I work every day beside men and women who are some of the foremost industry experts in hardware testing relevant to concerns over the use of mobile devices.</p>
<p><em>Usual disclaimer: all the opinions in this piece are mine, do not necessarily reflect that of my employer, the FAA, or anybody else in the whole wide world.</em></p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;ve had discussions with these guys about the use of mobile devices on board, and they seem wholly unconcerned. That&rsquo;s a significant data point in my mind. Second, I&rsquo;ve flown multiple times on our corporate jet with our lead FAA-authorized test pilot flying the plane. Never has he expressed any concern that we make sure our cell phones are turned off prior to takeoff. (I try to make sure to kick mine to airplane mode just so I don&rsquo;t drain my battery while searching for signal!)</p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;ve seen the test reports on how this hardware is tested.</p>
<p>Every critical piece of equipment that&rsquo;s going on the aircraft has to go through a challenging set of qualification tests. The exact tests will be dependent on the how the equipment will be used (for instance, you don&rsquo;t need a sand test for a box that&rsquo;s only going to used on the inside of a 747, but you would if it were mounted external on a helicopter), but you&rsquo;re always going to have to test it for things like vibration, temperature (bake it and freeze it!), and (most pertinent to this discussion) Radio Frequency susceptibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures of the test setups, and while I can&rsquo;t show them to you directly, here&rsquo;s the general idea of what they do:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2013/500px-Turn-Everything-Evil-inator.jpg" alt="500px-Turn-Everything-Evil-inator"></p>
<p>In this example, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is the tester, and the unit under test (display, autopilot, etc) is sitting on the table, while Agent P sits there monitoring to make sure it continues to run correctly while the Evil-Inator (or some similar sort of radio transmitter) beams radio waves at it.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not exaggerating much here.)</p>
<p>To pass these tests, the unit under test must work correctly while being bombarded with a whole range of radio frequencies. If it stops operating correctly, stop the test, update the hardware, and try again.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason they test avionics this way, and it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re afraid of people who forgot to turn off their cell phones. Airplanes frequently fly past radio transmission towers, and not infrequently through electrical storms. You want to be sure that you&rsquo;re not going to lose all of your displays and controls even in a freak situation.</p>
<p>The systems design to perform the most critical functions on the aircraft are carefully designed and analyzed to ensure that they will fail no more often than once every one <strong>billion</strong> flight hours. That&rsquo;s an amazing standard, more stringent than any other industry, save maybe nuclear. The engineers I know who design systems like our autopilots are some of the finest engineers I&rsquo;ve ever met.</p>
<p>So suffice it to say I&rsquo;m not particularly worried about being on a plane where everybody is allowed to have their iPhone or iPad or Kindle turned on during roll-out.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/travel/faa-portable-electronic-devices/">that CNN story</a>, Delta Airlines has already filed plans with the FAA to allow their passengers to use devices below 10,000 feet. I&rsquo;m excited to hear that. I don&rsquo;t know how fast the FAA will move, but.. I&rsquo;m flying to Florida next Monday for work, and I&rsquo;d love to be able to keep reading my e-book or watching my movie from boarding all the way through arrival.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday I attended a church in another town which I have infrequently visited before. Circumstances allowed me to help lead music as a part of their worship team. After the service I was approached by two different older (60-ish) men. This story is about them.</p>
<p><strong>The First Man</strong></p>
<p>The first man that approached me had given a testimony during the worship service. He was overflowing with contagious joy and appreciation for what God has been doing in his life. While his situation is still not an easy one, he took the time to ask about my family and job, then asked how he could pray for me and proceeded to take my arm and pray right there and then. What an encouragement! As he walked away we both had smiles on our faces and grace in our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Man</strong></p>
<p>The second man approached me a few minutes later, and after thanking me for my participation, proceeded to tell me that I should be praying for the church. He mentioned his theological training and proceeded to explain how the church would be improved if &ldquo;they&rdquo; would &ldquo;get a vision&rdquo; for aspects of their ministry that mirrored his. I patiently listened and politely nodded as he went on. When he walked away we both had expressions of concern. His, no doubt, was for that church and its ministries; mine was more for him, who would seemingly look past the good things happening in the church (even that morning!) to &ldquo;spiritually&rdquo; complain to a stranger about the church leadership&rsquo;s vision.</p>
<p><strong>OK, so I lied up in paragraph one. This story isn&rsquo;t really about them.</strong></p>
<p>As I was thinking over these interactions a day later, the realization hit me like a ton of bricks:</p>
<p><strong>I am the second man.</strong></p>
<p>No, not all the time. And maybe not quite so obviously. But if I think and look back over my past year of on- and off-line interactions, and if I&rsquo;m honest with myself, I&rsquo;m the second guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been quick to complain, criticize, and critique. I&rsquo;ve looked past the good things happening in my own congregation to pick at the nits that I&rsquo;ve disagreed with. Rather than being thankful for what&rsquo;s going on, I&rsquo;ve relied on my &ldquo;superior&rdquo; theological knowledge (I am, at best, a well-read amateur) to poke holes too many places where the church didn&rsquo;t align to &ldquo;my vision&rdquo; instead of just helping shore up the walls and foundations that truly might need a little help.</p>
<p>So let this serve as my public apology and repentance. (There are some private ones coming, too.) Where there are still correctives that should be made, may my first reaction always be grace and encouragement, and may I let the correctives wait for the right time and place.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p><em>(And hey, kick me if you catch me straying from this, eh?)</em></p>
<p><em>Clarification, because a couple people have asked: this is a real story, and those were real conversations.</em></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure I heard the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilynne_Robinson">Marilynne Robinson</a> several years ago when her novel <em>Gilead</em> won the Pulitzer Prize. She does live just down the road in Iowa City, after all. As I recall I even borrowed the book from the library and got bogged down in it pretty quickly. (Maybe I wasn&rsquo;t ready for it a decade ago.)</p>
<p>Then last year on a whim I borrowed <em>When I Was A Child I Read Books</em> from the library; a slim volume of essays that turned into <a href="/12/08/when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books-by-marilynne-robinson/">one of my favorite reads of the year</a>. (I need to go back and read it again.)</p>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AMarilynne_Robinson.jpg" title="By Christian Scott Heinen Bell (Own work) [CC0], via Wikimedia Commons"><img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Marilynne_Robinson.jpg/256px-Marilynne_Robinson.jpg" alt="Marilynne Robinson"></a></p>
<p>Robinson&rsquo;s writing reveals her as a delightful conundrum theologically. Raised Presbyterian, now part of the United Church of Christ, yet rather than embracing the theological ambiguity of the UCC she speaks fondly of John Calvin, clearly takes the Scriptures seriously, and reveals a deep humanism and care for people created in God&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/christian-not-conservative/">A recent interview of Robinson by The American Conservative</a> prompted me to write this post, and it&rsquo;s definitely worth a read. Robinson stakes her claim to &lsquo;liberal Protestantism&rsquo; that she describes as being &lsquo;grounded in Calvinism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When asked her thoughts about the association of Christianity with the American right-wing, she said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, what is a Christian, after all? Can we say that most of us are defined by the belief that Jesus Christ made the most gracious gift of his life and death for our redemption? Then what does he deserve from us? He said we are to love our enemies, to turn the other cheek. Granted, these are difficult teachings. But does our most gracious Lord deserve to have his name associated with concealed weapons and stand-your-ground laws, things that fly in the face of his teaching and example? Does he say anywhere that we exist primarily to drive an economy and flourish in it? He says precisely the opposite. Surely we all know this. I suspect that the association of Christianity with positions that would not survive a glance at the Gospels or the Epistles is opportunistic, and that if the actual Christians raised these questions those whose real commitments are to money and hostility and potential violence would drop the pretense and walk away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong stuff. And I love the spirit of what she says when asked about her views of the Second Coming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I expect to be very much surprised by the Second Coming. I would never have imagined the Incarnation or the Resurrection. To be astonishing seems to be the mark of God’s great acts—who could have imagined Creation? On these grounds it seems like presumption to me to treat what can only be speculation as if it were even tentative knowledge. I expect the goodness of God and the preciousness of Creation to be realized fully and eternally. I expect us all to receive a great instruction in the absolute nature of grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went to the library yesterday and picked up a copy of <em>Gilead</em>. It&rsquo;s time to give it another try. Then it&rsquo;s time to go back and find Robinson&rsquo;s other novels and essays. We are blessed to have a thinker and writer of Robinson&rsquo;s grace and skill sharing with us.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This past Sunday our worship team learned and led a new (old) song - Chris Tomlin&rsquo;s arrangement of (and new chorus for) the old hymn Crown Him With Many Crowns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqy-gob13kA">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>On the whole, I like it. If adding a contemporary chorus is what it takes to get us singing two and a half verses of densely-packed truth in a classic hymn, that&rsquo;s a deal I&rsquo;m willing to make.</p>
<p><em>Aside: the density of theological truth in this old hymn, when compared to what&rsquo;s in most modern songs, is really stunning. But that&rsquo;s a post for another time.</em></p>
<p>The one quibble I&rsquo;ve got with Tomlin&rsquo;s update to the hymn, if you&rsquo;ll allow me to be pedantic for a minute or two, is in the updates to remove the archaic articles. Now, I&rsquo;m not, in principle, against removing them. <em>Thee</em>, <em>Thou</em>, and <em>Thy</em> aren&rsquo;t in common usage any more, and a careful update can give the classic text a fresh new feel. But the changes here aren&rsquo;t so careful, or at least they&rsquo;ve sacrificed accuracy in favor of rhyming schemes. A couple of examples:</p>
<p>From Verse 1, the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awake my soul, and sing Of Him who died for Thee And hail Him as thy matchless King Through all eternity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awake my soul, and sing Of Him who died for <strong>me</strong> And hail Him as thy matchless King Through all eternity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That second line is a challenge to modernize, because getting lines two and four to rhyme really depends on having that long E sound at the end of line two. And replacing &ldquo;thee&rdquo; with &ldquo;me&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually change the theological content in any particularly objectionable way.</p>
<p>But it changes the perspective of the verse. In the original, the author calls his soul to sing, because Jesus died for his soul. In the update, the soul is called to sing because of the salvation of the author. A minor difference, but (at least to me) frustratingly annoying.</p>
<p>The second issue comes in what was the tail end of the fourth verse in the original, but which Tomlin has repurposed as a bridge in his version.</p>
<p>The original:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Redeemer, hail! For thou hast died for me; Thy praise and glory shall not fail throughout eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All hail, Redeemer, hail! For <strong>He has</strong> died for me <strong>His</strong> praise and glory shall not fail Throughout eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&rsquo;s the same problem - what the heck do you use to rhyme with <em>eternity</em>? <em>A friend on Facebook pointed out that the problem (quite obviously, upon reflection) isn&rsquo;t with rhyming &lsquo;eternity&rsquo;. Doh!</em></p>
<p>This time I dislike the solution quite a bit more, because it changes the direction of the lines. In the original hymn, the hymnwriter turns to address Christ directly at the end. &ldquo;All hail, Redeemer, hail! You have died for me!&rdquo; But the reworking turns it into an account of Christ&rsquo;s work rather than a direct stanza of praise.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s still not <em>wrong</em>, but it really loses something in the translation.</p>
<p>OK, yes, I&rsquo;m being pedantic. I&rsquo;m still happy we sang the song, and I hope we include it in our regular song rotation. But I&rsquo;m also still tempted to conclude that maybe the better lesson for the modern church would be to learn to sing and appreciate some of these classic hymns without forcing them to fit our modern musical sensibilities. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just getting crotchety in my late 30&rsquo;s.</p>

For a time I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.</p>
<p>--&ldquo;The Peace of Wild Things&rdquo; by Wendell Berry</p>

			 <p>A good insight here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a genuine sermon must begin with the first proclamation, with the proclamation of salvation. There is nothing more solid, deep and sure than this proclamation. Then you have to do catechesis. Then you can draw even a moral consequence. <strong>But the proclamation of the saving love of God comes before moral and religious imperatives.</strong> Today sometimes it seems that the opposite order is prevailing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta love this.</p>
<p>First proclaim the gospel, the truth of God&rsquo;s love and salvation.</p>
<p>Then do your doctrinal teaching.</p>
<p>Then draw a &ldquo;moral consequence&rdquo; - the &ldquo;what to do&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But get the order right.</p>
<p>This is just one piece of the wisdom from Pope Francis, as documented in <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview">this recently-published interview</a>. It&rsquo;s long, but a remarkable and highly-recommended read.</p>

			 <p>Comedian <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com">Marc Maron</a> has a <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_420_-_ben_sidran">fantastic recent podcast episode</a> where he interviews jazz pianist <a href="http://bensidran.com/">Ben Sidran</a>.</p>
<p>In the midst of a long, fascinating discussion about jazz and rock music and the music scene of the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s, Maron and Sidran has this interchange that&rsquo;s really about more than just music [starting at about 36:20 on the podcast]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Sidran:</em></strong> In jazz you can spend 8 hours a day blowing through a copper tube, right, and I promise you that after 10 years that tube will not change, but you will be totally transformed.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We&rsquo;re transforming ourselves here, and you can&rsquo;t do it if you&rsquo;re not in public. If you can&rsquo;t make your mistakes in front of people, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, so what? You can&rsquo;t make a mistake alone and you&rsquo;re sitting there with friends - you gotta go out and hang it out.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong><em>Maron:</em></strong> That&rsquo;s getting lost in the culture we live in now, across the board - there&rsquo;s an expectation of quality content to be provided at all times, and if you do let it hang out and it doesn&rsquo;t go well, you&rsquo;ve got an entire culture of people who are gonna be &lsquo;Aaah, he didn&rsquo;t, you know, he let it hang out and he&rsquo;s an a**hole, and it didn&rsquo;t work&rsquo;, and now that&rsquo;s out there being misinterpreted.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Here we are as human beings looking for personal truths, willing to make mistakes in public and fight the good fight, and you&rsquo;ve got a bunch of a**holes who are gonna be, like, &lsquo;well, you didn&rsquo;t quite do it, did you?&rsquo;. Well that&rsquo;s part of the thing! We&rsquo;re at risk of losing what is organically human in the creative process.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong><em>Sidran:</em></strong> Well that&rsquo;s the same thing in the music business, especially as you get further and further into digital technology, it&rsquo;s possible to fix it. You know, <strong>just because it&rsquo;s possible to make something perfect doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a good idea</strong>.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong><em>Maron:</em></strong> What is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, right?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong><em>Sidran:</em></strong> What is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. <strong>Perfect is just your pathetic attempt to hide</strong> in the technology, right? &ldquo;Ooh, I made a mistake.&rdquo; But the stuff that we love is, for me, and I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s the same in comedy - it&rsquo;s not so much avoiding the mistakes but how you recover from mistakes.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Like if you&rsquo;re in public and you do something and you didn&rsquo;t intend to do it and the first thought in your mind is &ldquo;shit, what did I just do?&rdquo;, if you can train yourself to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna make something out of that&rdquo;, in that recovery there is transcendence, and people have a sense that something magical just happened. It&rsquo;s in the recovery. <strong>It&rsquo;s not in being perfect, it&rsquo;s in letting it all come through and using it.</strong><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong><em>Maron:</em></strong> Right, I love it. I never thought about it like that. <strong>Like every moment of misstep is an opportunity to transcend that moment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much truth there, and the spiritual application isn&rsquo;t far off, whether Maron and Sidran know it or not. Each of us as Christians have our own experiences of pain and failure to work through - some greater than others. (My mind immediately went to recent pieces from blog friends <a href="http://culturalsavage.com/christianity/shame-and-antiphychotics/">Aaron Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.zhoag.com/2013/09/03/riffing-on-prototype/">Zach Hoag</a>, just two of many.)</p>
<p>And while our ultimate hope is for the day when Jesus will restore us from brokenness and transform us into something beautiful, new, and eternal, we see temporal glimpses of that transformation as God works in us now, in the responses that Maron and Sidner talk about here.</p>
<p>In the recovery, we see transcendence. Something holy working to heal and transform.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t make your mistakes in public, what does it matter? How much do I really believe in grace if I want to go into the studio and edit all the mistakes out of my life before I show it in public?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect&rdquo; is just my pathetic attempt to hide. It&rsquo;s not in being &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;, because perfect is impossible. Often due to my own failings - sometimes due to the failings of others who have hurt me. Where we see the transcendent, though, is when we let all of that through, and then see God working and shining through the brokenness.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s Friday headed in to a holiday weekend and I&rsquo;m tired of writing about serious topics, so it&rsquo;s time to share this video - a 6-minute PBS feature on mandolin player extraordinaire Chris Thile.</p>
<p>Thile, only 32 years old but long known for his bluegrass/folk/Americana, has recently released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3NSYEE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00E3NSYEE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">an album of Bach Sonatas and Partitas played on the mandolin</a>.

			 <p>My brother-from-another-mother Daniel Deboer has <a href="http://okaywhatever.com/wordpress/guilt-factories/">a great post up about what he calls &ldquo;Guilt Factories&rdquo;</a> that&rsquo;s worth reading. A snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First you say that grace/faith is all that matters. Then you say that works flow out of grace. Then, as a result of that, you say that what God really cares about is your “heart”. Because if you heart is in the right place, your works are going to be in the right place too.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Then finish it off with a dollop of strictly enforced cultural norms, traditions, and piety. The piety is where it really gets intense, because the grace/faith you’ve been given is supposed to end up in works that are supposed to end up looking exactly like the received norms, the traditions, and the piety.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If you don’t have that piety, you don’t have the works. If you don’t have the works, you don’t have the faith. Either you (at best) have a “hard heart” or (at worst) are plain wolf among sheep.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
That’s a Guilt Factory right there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s more than a snippet, but there&rsquo;s enough more over on his site that if you&rsquo;ve made it this far you should <a href="http://okaywhatever.com/wordpress/guilt-factories/">go read the whole thing</a>.</p>

			 <p>In case you&rsquo;re not already caught up: the discussion started with Thabiti Anyabwile&rsquo;s post on TGC, <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/thabitianyabwile/2013/08/19/the-importance-of-your-gag-reflex-when-discussing-homosexuality-and-gay-marriage/">&ldquo;The Importance of Your Gag Reflex When Discussing Homosexuality and “Gay Marriage”&quot;</a>. One-line summary: &ldquo;Return the [gay marriage] discussion to sexual behavior in all its yuckiest gag-inducing truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then yesterday Richard Beck posted a response: <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2013/08/on-love-and-yuck-factor.html">On Love and the Yuck Factor</a>. Two-line summary: (1) &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s healthy to use disgust to regulate moral behavior.&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;When disgust is involved any purported distinction being made between persons and behavior is&hellip; a verbal obfuscation of the underlying psychology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been a bunch of other thoughtful responses (to both men), including <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2013/08/on-love-and-yuck-factor.html#comment-1013564429">a long comment on Beck&rsquo;s piece from &ldquo;dmr5090&rdquo;</a> (sheesh, people, can&rsquo;t you use real names at least?). Key points in those rebuttals to Beck have often been along the lines of (1) Shouldn&rsquo;t sin gross us out?, (2) &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you just trying to argue that &lsquo;homosexuality isn&rsquo;t a sin&rsquo; without admitting it?&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;The words &lsquo;gag reflex&rsquo; and &lsquo;yuck factor&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t Anyabwile&rsquo;s - he&rsquo;s just quoting a gay journalist.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>To be fair, I have grossly simplified, hopefully not unfairly, all the posts I&rsquo;ve linked so far. If you want to dig into this argument, go read them all.</em></p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the thing: I know there&rsquo;s a battle raging among various flavors of Protestants and even evangelicals over homosexuality. But I can believe on one hand that homosexual acts are sinful, and on the other hand still respond with revulsion to Anyabwile&rsquo;s post. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p><strong>1. Inconsistent application of the tactic.</strong> Why do we not hear preachers like Anyabwile use this &ldquo;gag reflex&rdquo; topic when addressing other, more &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; sins? Let&rsquo;s hear a few sermons on gluttony that try to gross me out with discussions of sweaty mounds of obese flesh before you try to claim that the &ldquo;gross out&rdquo; strategy is really one you think should be used across the board.</p>
<p><strong>2. The encouragement to revulsion at the act quickly leads to revulsion of the person.</strong> Yes, sin is revolting. <em>All</em> sin should be revolting to us. But to encourage a &ldquo;gag reflex&rdquo; response to homosexuality will very quickly lead a person to have that &ldquo;gag reflex&rdquo; toward the homosexual person. And that&rsquo;s the furthest thing from what Christ calls us to. I <em>know</em> that Anyabwile says in his post that we &ldquo;should not be mean and bigoted&rdquo;. But I don&rsquo;t understand how you can encourage a gag reflex when you hear &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo; and not end up that way. (Beck made this point in his post far better than I&rsquo;m saying it here.)</p>
<p><em>(Observation: while writing this I was about to say that Anyabwile said we should still love the sinners, but he never actually says that in his piece. All he says is that we should not be mean and bigoted, and that we should &lsquo;speak the truth in love&rsquo;. And the truth, he says, is that homosexual relationships cannot properly be called &lsquo;love&rsquo;. Not sure it&rsquo;s fair to draw a conclusion from that, but it&rsquo;s bothersome.)</em></p>
<p><strong>3. This is the old &ldquo;culture warrior&rdquo; position again.</strong> Have we not learned yet that sin is not going to be defeated by us making the right arguments to those in privileged positions in the halls of power? Anyabwile seems to think that if he&rsquo;d just managed to gross out the right people in powerful positions, we wouldn&rsquo;t have legalized gay marriage. I say that&rsquo;s baloney. We&rsquo;ve had the evangelical attempts at political power for at least 30 years. Buchanan, Falwell, Dobson&hellip; How&rsquo;s that worked out for us?</p>
<p><strong>4. The Gospel is not &ldquo;sin is icky&rdquo;.</strong> The Gospel message is that we are <em>all</em> sinful, all equally in need of Christ&rsquo;s grace and forgiveness. That God is in the process of making all things new, of drawing people to himself. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> the message we need to be spending our time on.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2013/08/08/when-church-and-convictions-conflict/">Yesterday I recommended Ed Cyzewski&rsquo;s post talking about when church and your personal convictions come into conflict.</a> Today I&rsquo;d like to follow up by telling my own story.</p>
<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea</h3>
<p>A little over ago my church decided it was time to promote men&rsquo;s small groups. And the timing seemed great for me. I was coming through a time of spiritual wrangling and frustration, and was convinced that I needed more frequent and better interaction with godly men in my life. Then I found out how it was going to be themed: Band of Brothers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2013/bandofbros.jpg" alt="bandofbros"></p>
<p>(This isn&rsquo;t my church&rsquo;s actual ministry logo, but it&rsquo;s close to what was used.)</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m objective, I&rsquo;ve gotta give the planners props for buying in to the theme. The small groups are called &ldquo;squads&rdquo;. Each level of the leadership had a &ldquo;rank&rdquo;, and the promotional videos showed the leaders wearing fatigues, moving little army men around a map on a planning table. The invitations to various events were titled &ldquo;Marching Orders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that the two pastors leading it up weren&rsquo;t whole-hog into the theme, but the lay leaders who helped with it were, and so it got adopted. The activities were all camping and outdoors themed. They included plans for a &ldquo;commitment ceremony&rdquo; taken straight out of a <em>Courageous</em> movie marketing pack.</p>
<p><strong>And I&rsquo;ll be honest: my first reaction was to squirm.</strong></p>
<p>Why must men&rsquo;s ministries be focused around shooting/camping/hunting/outdoorsy stuff? Is it really that big a motivator? I&rsquo;m not a big outdoorsy guy, so maybe I&rsquo;m just not their target audience. I&rsquo;m a musician. And a computer geek / engineer. I mean, I also run and play sports and know how to work with my hands, but I&rsquo;ve never shot anything bigger than a .22 or more alive than a cardboard box.</p>
<p>But I think it was more than discomfort - it was conviction. Conviction that it would be wrong for me to participate in a program that appeared to be focused around all the militaristic trappings that I believe to be unnecessary and at times very unhelpful.</p>
<h3 id="an-attempt">An attempt</h3>
<p>After a couple days of mulling it over, I came up with what I thought would be a win-win solution. So I emailed the pastor leading it, explained that I really wanted to be in a small group but couldn&rsquo;t stomach the militaristic trappings. So, was there room for &ldquo;conscientious objector&rdquo; status within the Band of Brothers? (Hey, creative thinking and humor oughta get me somewhere, right?)</p>
<p>The response I got back the next day was unexpectedly infuriating. Sorry, he said, but no. There was no room for &ldquo;conscientious objectors&rdquo;. He said it would be &ldquo;detrimental to squad morale&rdquo; if all the members weren&rsquo;t totally committed to all the activities.</p>
<p>And that was that. I was pissed.</p>
<p><em>Here I am</em>, I thought, <em>trying to participate in a ministry that I <strong>know</strong> I need, and <strong>they won&rsquo;t let me</strong>.</em></p>
<p>(Did I mention I was angry?)</p>
<p>That was the first time in what was then four years at my church where I seriously thought about looking for someplace else. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a better ending to this story.</p>
<h3 id="a-redirection">A redirection</h3>
<p>I talked to my wife about it for a while. I talked to another pastor about it. (Yeah, for you scoring at home, that&rsquo;s the third different pastor mentioned in this story. Our church has five at the moment. Four will appear in this story before it&rsquo;s done.)</p>
<p>That other pastor told me (very wisely) that he was more worried about my relationship with pastor #1 than he was about the small group thing. (I was appropriately brought down a notch or two.) My wife reminded me that there were other similar options that the church offered that I had, to this point, not pursued. (Down another couple notches.)</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t sign up for the Band of Brothers. Instead, the next Tuesday morning at 6 AM I came, bleary-eyed and with coffee in hand, to a men&rsquo;s prayer group / Bible study hosted by our senior pastor. And within 15 minutes I knew I was in the right place.</p>
<p>At age 36 I&rsquo;m the youngest guy in the Tuesday morning study by almost 10 years. There&rsquo;s one regular in his 40s, but most are between late 50s and early 70s. Our senior member is a WWII veteran.</p>
<p>The agenda each Tuesday is simple: share requests, pray for each other, and study whatever the sermon text is going to be for the following Sunday. (Whichever activity we start with usually goes long, so we tend to alternate between mostly prayer one week and then mostly study the next week.) The accumulated wisdom in that room each week is deep and vast. I am (mostly) keeping my mouth shut and learning a lot. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>So this fall they&rsquo;re cranking up the second year of Band of Brothers, and I&rsquo;m starting my second year of the Tuesday morning study. And I&rsquo;m at peace that I&rsquo;ve made the right choice for me, for now.</p>
<h3 id="some-final-thoughts">Some final thoughts</h3>
<p>As I reflect on this after a year to cool off, I&rsquo;ve got some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <em>still</em> think the militaristic theme is unnecessary. But having not attended any of the events I can&rsquo;t fairly opine on the ministry any more than that.</li>
<li>I know that they had far greater numbers of men in the ministry last year than they had expected. If it&rsquo;s bringing men in and sharpening them, praise God.</li>
<li>Like Ed said his post: look for ways to participate and serve that don&rsquo;t confict with your convictions. While they weren&rsquo;t going to change the men&rsquo;s ministry just for me (nor should they have), there were other opportunities available if I was willing to seek them out.</li>
<li>This situation highlights one of the benefits of a larger church: that diversity of opportunities. If this had played out at a smaller church it might well have had a less happy ending.</li>
<li>Even though I disagree with them at times, I&rsquo;m hugely blessed to have good pastors and leaders in my church.</li>
</ul>

			 <p><a href="http://inamirrordimly.com/2013/08/07/hope-for-those-who-feel-left-out-of-church/">Ed Cyzewski put up a great post yesterday</a> about diversity of churches and ministries and about using your unique giftings to serve God. He tells a couple of stories about his own experience being pulled into churches or ministries that put him at great unease, then follows up with these words which were of great encouragement to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have your own way of interacting with God and with others. Don’t be ashamed of that&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Diversity in church experience doesn’t mean there are those who do it right and those who do it wrong.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Look for the life of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ed manages to strike a good balance between complete &ldquo;me-focus&rdquo; and totally ignoring one&rsquo;s own personality and convictions here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes our desires and opinions will lead us astray, prompting us to try to remake the church in our own image. I’ve done that and seen that first hand.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
However, in seeking a church community, pay attention to the things that resonate with you. How is God speaking to you? What burdens are on your heart?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
God doesn’t give us burdens and desires in order to frustrate us—at least, to frustrate us for the rest of our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he brings it home (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the key: <strong>Church shouldn’t force us to sacrifice our freedom and convictions.</strong><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Church should both nurture and provide an outlet for the life that God is building up in us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wise words.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/07/26/internet-filtering-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-07-26 12:44:30 -0500">Jul 26, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Internet filtering has been a hot topic in the news the past few days. In Britain, prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23401076">David Cameron has proposed</a> that all British internet service providers must turn on a &ldquo;family-friendly filter&rdquo; by default for all users, which would only be turned off at the account holder&rsquo;s specific request. The goal: to keep pornography away from children.</p>
<p>Today, Gospel Coalition blogger Joe Carter published a piece titled <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2013/07/25/online-pornography-to-be-blocked-by-default-in-the-uk/">&ldquo;Why Online Pornography is Being Blocked in the UK—and Why It Should Be in the U.S. Too&rdquo;</a>. Says Carter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he support for unlimited access to pornography, distributed freely in every home with an Internet connection, is not a cause that any Christian should tolerate, much less support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now on one hand I want to agree with Mr. Carter on this one. I think internet filtering is an excellent idea. I have my home computers set up with filters to help keep myself out of trouble and to try to help protect my children. But I&rsquo;m hesitant to support filtering as a government requirement, for at least a couple of reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong> To put it simply: it ain&rsquo;t that easy. Existing filtering sites/mechanisms are typically based on blacklists - lists of domains known to contain objectionable material. And the granularity on those blacklists isn&rsquo;t so good. An image sharing site, for example, could contain both perfectly acceptable and very improper material. So do you block it or let it go? And secondly, let&rsquo;s face it: how many teenage boys with hacking skills are going to let this slow them down? It won&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p><strong>On Principle&hellip;</strong> I&rsquo;m also concerned about establishing the precedent that the government should dictate content filtering of some sort. Sure, right now in Britain you can request to have it turned off. But once the filtering is there, it&rsquo;s a much shorter step to just say it needs to stay turned on all the time for some content. And who decides which content?</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s easy for Christians to agree that porn should be filtered. But what happens when the government decides that maybe certain &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; should be filtered, too? What happens when the government decides that &ldquo;hate speech&rdquo; includes speaking what you believe the Bible says about, say, homosexuality? Suddenly that government-mandated filtering doesn&rsquo;t seem so wonderful, does it?</p>
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a right way to do it</strong> Here&rsquo;s the thing: I&rsquo;m not against filtering. Not in the least. And if ISPs want to provide filtering, even turned on by default, as a service to their customers, and as good citizens, I think that&rsquo;d be excellent. Every parent should be encouraged to take steps to protect their children from things they don&rsquo;t need to see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest: I&rsquo;ve been wrestling with this position quite a bit this morning. I&rsquo;ve had a good Twitter conversation with my friend <a href="http://twitter.com/andrewosenga">Andy Osenga</a>, who disagrees with me on this one. And I&rsquo;ve certainly not complained when the government has taken steps to restrict unhealthy/destructive personal behavior for the public good. (I <em>love</em> Iowa&rsquo;s no-smoking laws.) But I think this situation is different.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestricted internet communication is the 21st century analogue of the free speech that the First Amendment prohibits the Congress from infringing upon.</strong> And I&rsquo;d rather not start giving away that freedom.</p>
<p>And yeah, I know I&rsquo;m making a slippery slope argument. But this is the government that in the past decade has told us that it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;enhanced interrogations&rdquo; of the really bad guys, and next thing you know we have <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/grandfather-of-american-teen-killed-in-drone-strike-demands-answers/">drones killing a 16-year-old American citizen without any due process</a>. So forgive me if I&rsquo;m not inclined to believe that the government won&rsquo;t expand its reach at every opportunity.</p>
<p>There are a lot of current rights / privileges that American Christians enjoy that we could consider worth giving up in order to better follow Christ or to have a better society. But <em>speech</em>? Eesh, let&rsquo;s be careful there.</p>

			 <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been reading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090YCKC8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0090YCKC8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">The Journey of Ministry: Insights from a Life of Practice</a></em> by Fuller seminary professor <a href="http://www.fuller.edu/academics/faculty/edmund-gibbs.aspx">Dr. Eddie Gibbs</a>. (Thanks go to Gibbs' son-in-law Brian Auten (a fellow <a href="http://www.boarsheadtavern.com">BHT</a> patron whom I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure to meet once, for far too short a conversation) for pointing it out when it was on sale.) While it seemed to start out a bit slowly, the second half of the book is chock full of good insights on the Western church and its needs in the 21st century.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090YCKC8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0090YCKC8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/wordpress/wp-content/551/2013/07/51R3ep0M1oL-199x300.jpg" alt="The Journey of Ministry cover"></a></p>
<p>A couple of choice bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The church also needs to multiply points of contact by taking the initiative in becoming involved in all aspects of community life and being seen making a transformative impact. We also need churches small enough for everybody to feel that they are valued, that their questions are welcomed and that they can make a contribution to expand and deepen the various expressions of ministry. The serious challenge we face today in older, traditional denominations and in many independent churches is that our model of church is not easily reproducible. It&rsquo;s too expensive, consumerist and controlled. It also is increasingly out of step with a networking, relational culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pulpit no longer provides the platform from which the neighboring community and beyond can be addressed. Its message seldom reaches beyond the dwindling ranks of the faithful, and sometimes it even falls on deaf ears in the pews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, OK, one more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The preacher must not be allowed to become the sole interpreter of a poem. Turning poetry into prose destroys the power of the medium. It&rsquo;s like explaining a joke. Poetry needs to be restored to the prophet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gibbs' Chapter 6, &lsquo;Communicating&rsquo;, on the roles of apostle, prophet, evangelist, teacher, and pastor is worth the price of the book all by itself. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0090YCKC8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0090YCKC8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Worth reading if you get the chance</a>.</p>

			 <p>I realize that everyone reading this has already either made a decision on a Google Reader replacement, or just had their eyes glaze over when I said &ldquo;Google Reader replacement&rdquo;, which means this post is probably unnecessary. But still, I want to take a second to sing the praises of <a href="http://www.newsblur.com">NewsBlur</a>.</p>
<p>NewsBlur is an RSS reader developed and maintained by one guy, <a href="http://www.samuelclay.com/">Samuel Clay</a>. He was working on it long before Google announced that they were killing Reader, and when that announcement came out he managed to scale up his reader from supporting a couple thousand users to, at current count, over 20,000.</p>
<p>Not only is the tool nice to look at and snappy, but Samuel&rsquo;s support is fantastic. I filed a help ticket yesterday morning complaining about a reload that wasn&rsquo;t working, and by last night he had it fixed. It seems even snappier today, which is awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not opposed to paying for services I find useful, and I&rsquo;m quite happy to be a premium user of NewsBlur and throw a few bucks Samuel&rsquo;s way on a regular basis. Here&rsquo;s hoping that NewsBlur continues to succeed long-term, and that other developers follow Samuel&rsquo;s lead in creating great services.</p>

			 <p>In my last post I touched just briefly on the evangelical &ldquo;modesty culture&rdquo;, wherein the church burdens women by telling them that they are responsible, based on how they dress, for causing their Christian brothers to lust. Today I&rsquo;d like to look at it in a little more detail and the short leap from there to a culture that minimizes and encourages covering-up of abuse, as allegedly existed in Sovereign Grace Ministries churches for many years.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the tweet and link that kicked off my thought process.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JasonBlair/status/345528050915606528">twitter.com/JasonBlai&hellip;</a></p>
<p>The post links in an audio excerpt from a sermon, which the blog author says is a &ldquo;powerful wake up call for women. If we care about our brothers in Christ&rdquo;, she says, &ldquo;we will&hellip; think about what we are wearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a transcript of the key portions of the audio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen carefully, ladies. This is not an aberration. This is not an unusual testimony. This is the norm.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“Each and every day on campus is a battle, a battle against my sin, a battle against temptation, a battle against my depraved mind. Every morning I have to cry out for mercy, strength and a renewed conviction to flee youthful lusts. The Spirit is faithful to bring me the renewal I need to prepare me to do war against my sin. Yet the temptation still exists. I am thankful God has created me to be attracted to women. However, campus is a loaded minefield. There are girls everywhere and it is guaranteed that I will pass some attractive girls as I walk in between classes. I either have to be actively engaging my mind and my spirit to praying, quoting Scripture, listening to worship musicor simply looking at the sidewalk to make it through unscathed. Many days it takes all four to be safe.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“The thing that women do not seem to fully grasp is that the temptation towards lust does not stop for us as men. It is continual. It is aggressive. It does all it can to lead men down to death.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“They have a choice to help or deter its goal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heavy stuff. The guy who gave this testimony apparently can&rsquo;t walk past an attractive woman without lusting after her unless he is &ldquo;actively&rdquo; works to ignore or avoid her. And because of that, this pastor tells the women of his congregation that <strong>their choice of immodest clothing will help &ldquo;lead men down to death&rdquo;</strong>. (A booklet with practical modesty tips was reportedly handed out to all the women after the sermon.)</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="http://www.themodestmomblog.com/2011/04/she-wears-skirts-what-guys-think-about/">comments on the post</a> are tragic. One wife reported that &ldquo;we actually changed churches because my husband didn&rsquo;t feel like he could open his eyes in the church building without seeing cleavage and lot of legs.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="really">Really?</h3>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m a 30-something man who has to deal with all the common temptations. I&rsquo;m also the father of three young daughters. So I&rsquo;m about as invested in this particular topic as I possibly could be. And you know what? My first reaction isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;yeah, let&rsquo;s make sure these girls get covered up&rdquo;. My first reaction is that <strong>these men need to grow up and learn some self-control</strong>.</p>
<p>You know what, bro? If you can&rsquo;t walk down the street, through the mall, or across campus without lusting over every cute girl you walk past, you need to get some help. Talk to a godly older man who can disciple you. The apostle Paul didn&rsquo;t tell Timothy to avoid ministering to all the young women in order to protect himself from lust - instead he says to treat them as sisters, with absolute purity. (1 Tim 5:2) Heck, I&rsquo;ve got a cute younger sister, and I don&rsquo;t walk past her on the other side of the street with my head down. If you want to be a mature man and to be a useful servant in the church, you need to learn to deal with women as mothers and sisters. <strong>Avoidance is not the answer.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CulturalSavage/status/345598456443858945">twitter.com/CulturalS&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Now, back to the video. About the time I was getting saddened by the blog comments, I took a look at where this sermon audio came from, and it turns out that it&rsquo;s from <a href="http://media.sermonaudio.com/mediapdf/12908209345.pdf">a sermon preached by none other than C. J. Mahaney</a>, one of the founders of Sovereign Grace Ministries and the senior pastor of the lead SGM church. C. J. has been accused of conspiring to cover up multiple claims of sexual abuse occurring within the church.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s what strikes me: <strong>it&rsquo;s not a long leap</strong> to go from &ldquo;women carry great responsibility for causing men to lust&rdquo; to &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not ruin some men&rsquo;s lives by going to the police with abuse allegations&rdquo;. Because, after all, if the women are at least somewhat at fault for the lust, then aren&rsquo;t they somewhat at fault for the men choosing to abuse?</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t think for an instant that Mahaney or any of the other leaders in his church would say, if asked, that abuse is the victim&rsquo;s fault. <strong>But the culture that encourages placing responsibility on the women for the men&rsquo;s lust will also subtly place responsibility on the women for the abuse. And that has to stop.</strong></p>
<p>Brothers: if you need help, get help. The answer is not to avoid every woman other than your wife for the rest of your life. Take responsibility for your heart, mind, and actions. Love and cherish the women in the church as mothers and sisters [update: and as friends and equals (thanks @Knepherbird for the suggestion)], with all purity.</p>

			 <p>The evangelical blogosphere has been an interesting place lately. There have been voices talking about the <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/ministry/organizations/item/8515-sovereign-grace-sex-abuse-case-dismissed">abuse lawsuit against Sovereign Grace Ministries</a>, the statements supporting CJM from <a href="http://t4g.org/statement/">T4G</a> and <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/tgc/2013/05/24/why-we-have-been-silent-about-the-sgm-lawsuit/">TGC</a>. <a href="http://www.theveryworstmissionary.com/2013/06/sex-pt-2-why-wait.html">Jamie the VWM</a> and others have been addressing the evangelical church&rsquo;s &ldquo;purity culture&rdquo; and focus on &ldquo;modesty&rdquo;, both of which have the effect of objectifying women while claiming to try to do the opposite. Zach Hoag has hosted his <a href="http://www.zhoag.com/2013/06/14/elizabeth-morrow-modesty/">&ldquo;smokin' hot conversations&rdquo; series</a>, calling the evangelical church (especially the men) to greater responsibility. Bill Kinnon has written a good string of posts on the <a href="http://kinnon.tv/2013/06/cracks-in-the-celebrity-driven-church.html">celebrity-driven culture of the evangelical church</a> and the opportunities it provides for spiritual leadership abuse. And I think it&rsquo;s also important to pull in <a href="http://www.danjbrennan.com/">Dan Brennan</a>, whose book <em>Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions</em> calls the evangelical church to honor and encourage cross-gender friendships.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a common thread that we can find through all of these topics: fear. In some areas it&rsquo;s personal fear; in other areas the personal fear has become institutionalized into a culture of fear. But fear it is. And identifying and understanding fear is the key to defeating it.</p>
<p>Now when I start discussing these fears, some of you will object &ldquo;but the boundaries are there for a reason! There are real sins that we could fall into that we <em>should</em> be afraid of!&rdquo;. And to be fair, you have a point. But let&rsquo;s recall the Pharisees of Jesus' day. They didn&rsquo;t write all their rules just to be mean - they were afraid of committing specific sins that God defined (e.g. &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work on the Sabbath&rdquo;), and to make sure they stayed away from those sins, they put fences far outside of them. When Jesus came, he didn&rsquo;t approve those laws; instead he demolished them, saying that God was more concerned with the heart.</p>
<p><strong>We need some similar demolishing today.</strong></p>
<h3 id="cj-mahaney-sovereign-grace-ministries-t4g-and-tgc">CJ Mahaney, Sovereign Grace Ministries, T4G, and TGC</h3>
<p><a href="/13/05/t4g-and-tgc-break-their-silence-on-mahaney/">I&rsquo;ve written previously</a> about the multitude of abuse allegations currently surrounding SGM, including allegations that Mahaney and other leaders conspired to cover things up. I&rsquo;ve written about the leaders of Together for the Gospel (T4G) and The Gospel Coalition (TGC) circling the wagons with posts of tenuous veracity and exasperating one-sidedness.</p>
<p><em>What are they afraid of?</em></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re afraid of losing control. They believe, at some level, that God is better served if they enforce their flavor of doctrine and maintain a specific code of conduct (via church discipline and a strong emphasis on confession of sin) than if they relax and allow for Spirit-led variation. More damningly, they apparently believe at some level that God is better served by their church power structures staying intact than by working with civil authorities to bring justice to abusers.</p>
<p><em>How do we demolish this spirit of fear?</em></p>
<p>Go read what <a href="http://www.kinnon.tv">Bill Kinnon</a> has written about <a href="http://kinnon.tv/2013/06/cracks-in-the-celebrity-driven-church.html">the celebrity-driven church culture</a>. Resist the appeal of this sort of fame. Look for and listen to pastors who are faithfully, humbly, and accountably shepherding small flocks. Trust that the Jesus will be found by those who wholeheartedly seek Him.</p>
<h3 id="the-evangelical-purity-culture-and-the-call-for-modesty">The Evangelical Purity Culture and the call for Modesty</h3>
<p>There has been plenty of good stuff to read on the blogs lately addressing the evangelical focus on &ldquo;purity&rdquo; - the proliferation of &lsquo;True Love Waits&rsquo; pledges, purity rings, the assertion that any premarital sex inavoidably makes one &ldquo;damaged goods&rdquo;. Here I&rsquo;d recommend reading Alistair Roberts' post <a href="http://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/the-new-purity-ethic/">The New Purity Ethic</a> (an essay that will make this post seem short!) and, in a totally different flavor, Jamie Wright&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theveryworstmissionary.com/2013/06/sex-pt-2-why-wait.html">Why Wait?</a>.</p>
<p><em>What are we afraid of?</em></p>
<p>This purity culture is based around a fear of shame, of uncleanness, of being perceived as being &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; in some way. It reflects a belief that the highest priority is an external sexual purity. Hence, a sort of virginity test, especially with regard to women. Men prey on that fear by driving the focus on modesty, which improperly tries to place responsibility for men&rsquo;s sexual behavior (especially in their thought life) on women and how they dress. (This ironically ends up objectifying women&rsquo;s bodies in just the way it claims to want to avoid!)</p>
<p><em>How do we demolish this spirit of fear?</em></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a man: take responsibility for your own thoughts and actions. If you&rsquo;re a woman: stop accepting the shame that irresponsible men will try to put on you. Glorify God with your body, which is His. For anyone dealing with hurt and shame: go watch Matt Chandler&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLgIecL1IdY">Jesus Wants the Rose</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fear-of-cross-gender-friendships">Fear of Cross-Gender Friendships</h3>
<p>How many times have you heard it? Men and women can&rsquo;t be friends without sex becoming an issue, right? And with the church&rsquo;s purity culture (see previous point), men are taught that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;safer&rdquo; (and hence better) to avoid women altogether, if necessary, in order to avoid any sort of attraction. If you&rsquo;re married, any sort of friendship with a person of the opposite gender is popularly labeled &ldquo;emotional infidelity&rdquo; in a disastrous attempt to draw a parallel with Jesus' equating a lustful heart with adultery in Matthew 5.</p>
<p><em>What are we afraid of?</em></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re afraid of violating the evangelical cultural attitude that cross-gender friendships are just step one in an inevitable path to fornication or adultery, and the seemingly inevitable gossip and shame that such a relationship would attract.</p>
<p><em>How do we demolish this spirit of fear?</em></p>
<p>Here I have to recommend you start with <a href="http://www.danjbrennan.com">Dan J. Brennan&rsquo;s</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982580703/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982580703&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions</a></em>. Dan has both written and set a personal example for what beautiful, God-honoring cross-gender friendships can look like. I&rsquo;ll be honest here - I&rsquo;m uneasy at times with Dan&rsquo;s position. But piercing my discomfort is a ray of truth that I can&rsquo;t deny, so I will keep wrestling with it and looking for opportunities for real friendships with people of both genders.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>As I try to reach an end to this post, in addition to fear, I see the word <strong>shame</strong> has showed up over and over again. Shame is a powerful motivator, one that will restrain behavior in ways alternately appropriate and horrifying. If somehow you find yourself reading my blog and are not yet familiar with Dr. Richard Beck&rsquo;s blog <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/">Experimental Theology</a>, go start reading Beck and thank me later. His post <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2013/05/elizabeth-smart-and-psychology-of.html">Elizabeth Smart and the Psychology of the Christian Purity Culture</a> is an excellent place to start.</p>
<p><em>God has not given us a spirit of fear&hellip;</em></p>
<p>So says Paul in 2 Timothy 1:7. What has He given us instead? A spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind. So, friends: demolish the fear. The Spirit provides <strong>power</strong> to change, <strong>love</strong> to show God in all situations, and a <strong>sound mind</strong> to wrestle with these things.</p>
<p>With every one of these topics there is a legitimate &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; conversation to be had. But in each of these cases the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; has been institutionalized to the point that it has instead become a &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s my hope that we start demolishing the &ldquo;no&rdquo; so we can have room for the &ldquo;yes, but&rdquo; conversations.</p>
<h3 id="finally">Finally</h3>
<p>The antidote for these fearful attitudes and activities can also be found in the words of the prophet Micah. What does God require of us? Act justly. Love mercy. Walk humbly. And those words spoken over and over by God and His messengers to His people:</p>
<p><strong>Do not be afraid.</strong></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a hotel room tonight enjoying a family weekend and catching up on twitter while trying to get the kids to go to sleep, and in doing so I run across this from Pastor Steve McCoy this afternoon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clear on most things about God, but Calvinists anger me.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
- An Absurd Number of People<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(<a href="https://twitter.com/stevekmccoy/status/343089114112999424">@SteveKMcCoy</a>, June 7, 2013, at 2:36 PM)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Steve (pastor of an SBC church in the Chicago area) and <a href="http://Kinnon.tv">Bill Kinnon</a> went back and forth a bit on Twitter after that tweet, Bill suggesting that it was a bit judgmental to suggest that people who aren&rsquo;t Calvinists &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t clear on most things about God&rdquo;, and Steve saying that he didn&rsquo;t mean that everyone who hates Calvinism is unclear, but that &ldquo;an absurd number&rdquo; are. Their conversation trailed off before they came to any resolution.</p>
<p>Then there was this stunning quote from the <a href="http://founders.org/library/quiet/quiet3.html">Founders.org website</a>, for which SBC pastor Tom Ascol is a primary leader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first place, <strong>Calvinistic Christianity is nothing more and nothing less than biblical Christianity</strong>. It follows, then, that the future of Christianity itself is bound up in the fortunes of Calvinism&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&hellip;For whoever believes in God’s redemption through Christ and recognizes his own utter dependence on God, <strong>whoever recognizes that salvation is of the Lord, whoever seeks to glorify God in his worship and life, that person is already implicitly a Calvinist, no matter what he calls himself.</strong> In such circumstances, to make the person an explicit Calvinist, all we are required to do (humanly speaking) is to show the believer the natural implications of these already-held fundamental principles, which underlie all true Christianity, and trust God to do his work, that is, trust God to reveal these implications to the person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you get that? Calvinism is &ldquo;nothing more and nothing less than biblical Christianity&rdquo;. And if anyone recognizes salvation from the Lord, and seeks to glorify God, then that person is implicitly a Calvinist! And all the Calvinists need to do is explain it in a way that the unknowing Calvinist might understand.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that all proponents of Calvinism would make such presumptuous, arrogant claims, and I won&rsquo;t claim for an instant that there aren&rsquo;t some really God-ignorant Calvinism haters like Steve is talking about. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t speak for the group of progressive bloggers who have been very vocal in recent weeks about their concerns with Calvinism and certain highly visible Calvinist groups. But I can speak for myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly progressive. I accept the Bible as God&rsquo;s authoritative, inspired Word, but I don&rsquo;t think that means I have to read the first bits of Genesis literally. I believe, based on what I read in the Bible, that homosexual behavior is wrong, but I&rsquo;m in favor of the state sanctioning same-sex marriages and I believe Christians have done a pretty poor job of loving homosexuals over the last several decades. I voted for Bush twice and then Obama twice. I try to not post about politics on Facebook.</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d fit into Steve McCoy&rsquo;s category of being &ldquo;not clear on most things about God&rdquo;. I grew up in a very conservative Christian home, did 12 years of AWANA, attended a Christian university that required a bunch of Bible classes, have served as a deacon and an elder in a Conservative Baptist church and helped plant another CBA church that eventually became an Acts 29 church. I read widely in theology; my last couple years of reading includes Baptists, Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, Arminians and Calvinists alike.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the thing: (well, two things:) I&rsquo;m not a Calvinist. And some of what I&rsquo;m seeing out of some of these key Calvinists <em>does</em> anger me.</p>
<p>The big fuel on the fire lately has been <a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2013/05/24/t4g-and-tgc-break-their-silence-on-mahaney/">the recent statements about CJ Mahaney</a> and the sexual abuse lawsuits brewing against several folks from Sovereign Grace Ministries churches. Calvinist leaders like Albert Mohler, Mark Dever, Don Carson, and Justin Taylor have put out statements supporting Mahaney, and erroneously claiming that Mahaney was accused of no crime (he was accused of conspiring to keep the abuse claims quiet).</p>
<p>That men of such intellect and reputation would publish a statement with such obvious mistruths in it angers me. That after posting it on Facebook and getting dozens of disapproving comments, they deleted the statement and the comments frustrates me a lot. That then they, without comment, revised it to remove the claim that Mahaney was never accused, and <a href="http://t4g.org/statement/">posted it on their organization&rsquo;s website while disallowing comments</a> infuriates me.</p>
<p>That Justin Taylor would claim, on twitter, that continuing discussion with divisive folks is a sin (a not-so-subtle explanation, one would assume, for why he was keeping comments closed), only to delete the tweet a couple days later once people called him on it, makes me want to bang my head against the nearest immovable object.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate these guys. I have, in the past, respected them a lot. Which is why it&rsquo;s all the more infuriating and disappointing when I see them taking indefensible positions like these.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to assume that this circling of the wagons and declaration of Calvinism as nothing more or less than true Christianity is the default Calvinist position. I want to believe that there are Calvinist brothers and sisters out there who are as horrified by the alleged abuse and cover-up, and by the ridiculous arrogance of the Founders.org statement as I am.</p>
<p>But where are they? Why are they quiet?</p>
<p>Where is the Calvinist brother who is willing to publicly suggest that it would be wiser to not have CJ Mahaney still regularly preaching and on the conference circuit while allegations about the cover-up remain unresolved?</p>
<p>Where is the Southern Seminary graduate who is willing to say that while he personally believes Calvinism to be the truest expression of Christianity, he would never dream of asserting that every Christian would claim Calvinism if only they understood it better?</p>
<p>Without those voices many of us are left with few options but to believe that these are the default Calvinist positions. I beg you, my brothers, speak out and give us more options. God&rsquo;s church deserves better.</p>

			 <p>I like writing by hand, and I love the feel of writing with a good pen. In my experience, though, good pens are hard to find.</p>
<p>Several years ago I decided I wanted to give fountain pens a try. While I enjoyed the character that the fountain nib added to my writing, I always had a couple of issues: first, I could never get consistent ink flow through the nib. (Maybe I just wasn&rsquo;t willing to spend enough on a pen? The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T401Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002T401Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Lamy Safari</a> is usually spoken of highly, though.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Second, my handwriting tends to be small, which means I value thin, precise lines. Not so easy with a fountain pen. (I keep a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UXM3B4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002UXM3B4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Pilot Varsity disposable fountain pen</a> around for signing things at work. My signature: not so small.)</p>
<p>Then I found the <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.38-mm-Blue-Black/pd/304">Uniball Signo gel ink pens</a>, which are awesome. (I prefer the 0.38 mm width.) Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not sold directly in the US; I splurge every year or so and order a few from JetPens.com, which imports them from Asia.</p>
<p>Then last week somebody linked to and highly recommended the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001603YXI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001603YXI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Parker Jotter ballpoint retractable pen</a>. This little gem is stainless steel, refillable, and a little smaller than your normal sized pen; all winners as far as I was concerned.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I found out it was the pen used as James Bond&rsquo;s exploding pen in Goldeneye, and that sealed the deal. (I&rsquo;m a sucker for Goldeneye for some reason.) The video here is queued up for maximum clicky-ness. (Unfortunately I was unable to find one that ran long enough to get computer hacker Boris&rsquo;s final, exultant cry of &ldquo;I am invincible!&rdquo;.)</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOGrIcYCu' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>And friends, the pen sounds <em>exactly like that</em> when I click it. Which is awesome. (Come back in a week to find out if I&rsquo;ve completely annoyed my wife with the clicking yet.)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s Memorial Day here in the States, which means we&rsquo;ve been enjoying a day together as a family. I enjoy days when I get to spend time with my girls - it&rsquo;s so fun to see the cool people they&rsquo;re turning into as they get older.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2013/puddle-dance.jpeg" alt="puddle_dance"></p>
<p>A few random parenting &ldquo;wins&rdquo; from today:</p>
<p>Laura, age 8.5, suddenly likes to hang out and play games. She suggested we play Flux (a card game) this morning, and then proceeded to lose gracefully to her younger sister, twice. (This is a much bigger accomplishment than it sounds.)</p>
<p>Addie, age 7, watched a My Little Pony cartoon this morning, then came excitedly to tell me that at the end of the cartoon all the flying ponies had flown across the sun, and that the scene was just like what had happened in the movie E.T. (When our seven year old is picking out classic movie references, we must be doing <em>something</em> right!)</p>
<p>Katie, age 4, was &ldquo;reading&rdquo; her Grams a book this afternoon while we were driving in the van. When she got to the end, she meant, I think, to end the story with &ldquo;they lived happily ever after&rdquo;, but instead it came out as &ldquo;happily after all&rdquo;. The more I think about it, there&rsquo;s something profound about that ending.</p>
<p>None of us will likely live happily &ldquo;ever after&rdquo;; but may we all have the opportunity to live happily after all.</p>

			 <p>Boz Tchividjian (grandson of Billy Graham, law professor at Liberty University, and former state prosecutor in Florida) <a href="http://netgrace.org/where-are-the-voices-the-continued-culture-of-silence-and-protection-in-american-evangelicalism/">weighs in on the SGM abuse allegations</a> and this week&rsquo;s troubling statements on that topic from The Gospel Coalition and Together for the Gospel.</p>
<p>The allegations, Tchividjian says, are horrifying, and based on his experience carry the hallmarks of truth and seem highly credible. So, he went searching the internet to see if Christian leaders were saying anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I searched online hoping to find statements by Christian “leaders” speaking out about this case or at the very least expressing grave concerns regarding the very disturbing facts alleged in the lawsuit. I was never looking for, or wanting, anyone to throw CJ Mahaney under the proverbial bus. I was simply hoping to hear statements that expressed horrors about child sexual abuse and with institutions that are not transparent about such offenses. Initially, all I found was silence from these leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As some of us have been noting for several weeks, the silence has been deafening. So, what did he actually find?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I did find was a lot of statements by Christians claiming that all of these individuals were innocent until “proven guilty by a jury”. Sadly, that is not the only time I have heard such a response from the Christian community when allegations of child sexual victimization are brought forward. What is ironic, or better yet, down right disturbing is that these same individuals don’t approach any other sinful crime in such a distorted manner&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have personally gotten similar reactions when the topic has come up on Twitter, and I&rsquo;ve seen many others get that reaction as well. Few &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; are saying much about the horror of the crime; what they&rsquo;re saying is &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s proven anything yet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He then makes four observations about the TGC and T4G statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Neither statement makes mention that the heart of this lawsuit is about a systematic church effort to discourage and eventually prevent the families of children who were allegedly (and repeatedly) sexually victimized by church officials from speaking out and reporting to law enforcement. A statement that fails to mention that this lawsuit is less about the abuse and more about an institution that took steps to protect itself and its reputation over the victimized souls and bodies of little ones. Omitting such fundamental facts from these statements speaks volumes about the inability of the authors to grasp the eternal significance about which they write.</li>
<li>Neither statement mentions that CJ Mahaney was actually the Senior Pastor at one of these churches where all of this horrific abuse allegedly occurred AND where these families were discouraged from bringing this matter to the God ordained civil authorities? Including this would simply state a known fact without implicating Mr. Mahaney in any wrongdoing. Omitting such a fundamentally important fact from this statement is extremely disturbing to me and very disheartening to so many others.</li>
<li>The statement by T4G fails to mention that this lawsuit was dismissed for one reason and one reason only…expiration of the statute of limitation. Isn’t it tragic that the reason why this suit was dismissed – taking too long to file – was the very objective of these church leaders allegedly had when they discouraged these individuals and families from stepping forward.</li>
<li>The statement by the members of the Gospel Coalition says the following as it relates to the statute of limitations and the dismissal of the case: <em>So the entire legal strategy was dependent on a conspiracy theory that was more hearsay than anything like reasonable demonstration of culpability. As to the specific matter of C. J. participating in some massive cover-up, the legal evidence was so paltry (more like non-existent) that the judge did not think a trial was even warranted.</em> Does this sound like a statement that even appears to make an effort to be objective?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole piece is worth a read. I hope and pray that more Christian leaders will make their voices heard.</p>

			 <p>One of the great frustrations of those trying to bring the allegations of rampant child abuse and cover-up in Sovereign Grace Ministries (SGM) churches to light has been the silence of those who have long been founder CJ Mahaney&rsquo;s greatest supporters - Al Mohler, Mark Dever, and Ligon Duncan of Together For The Gospel (T4G) and Don Carson, Justin Taylor, and the rest at The Gospel Coalition (TGC).</p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, in light of the dismissal of the majority of the civil suit against SGM folks (due to the statute of limitations), and in what appears to be a coordinated move, both those groups have issued statements of their continued support for Mahaney.</p>
<h3 id="together-for-the-gospel">Together for the Gospel</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://m.facebook.com/TogetherfortheGospel/posts/10151372507262115">T4G statement came out last night on Facebook</a> [Update: statement has been deleted from FB; It is also <a href="http://t4g.org/statement/">on the T4G website</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t allow comments.] and is troubling. They first seek to cloud the water about the civil lawsuit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Claims presented in a civil lawsuit seeking financial compensation are beyond the ability of the public to render judgment. Often, such claims are even beyond the ability of a court to deliberate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if even the courts don&rsquo;t have the ability to render judgment in these sort of issues, who can? Paul seems pretty clear in Romans 13 that God has established the civil authorities to bring punishment to wrongdoers.</p>
<p>They go on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a Christian leader is accused of any wrongdoing, those to whom he is accountable must investigate the charges and then deal responsibly with the evidence. If a criminal accusation is made, Christians have a fundamental duty to inform law enforcement officials. This does not, however, preclude or mitigate the church&rsquo;s responsibility for biblical church discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a key point. To whom was CJ Mahaney responsible? It has been made abundantly clear from the brouhaha around Mahaney and SGM polity over the past couple years that <strong>Mahaney was essentially accountable to no one</strong>. When it was deemed best that he step down from leadership, he didn&rsquo;t stay at his home church, under discipline; instead he left to attend Dever&rsquo;s church in Washington, DC, then went to start another church in Mohler&rsquo;s backyard in Louisville. If anyone was in position to hold Mahaney accountable, it was Dever, Mohler, and Duncan, but to all appearances they have completely failed to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Christian leader, charged with any credible, serious, and direct wrongdoing, would usually be well advised to step down from public ministry. No such accusation of direct wrongdoing was ever made against C. J. Mahaney.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This almost defies belief. Mahaney was accused, in the lawsuit, of conspiring to keep the abuse covered up. At a bare minimum, he failed to report the abuse accusations to the authorities, even though he was in a position where he was legally required to do so. So are those charges not credible? Not serious? Or not direct? It would appear that <strong>Mohler, Duncan, and Dever are saying either that (1) the charges against SGM aren&rsquo;t credible, or (2) that failure to mandatorily report child abuse is not a serious or direct charge.</strong> Really?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who minister in the name of the Lord Christ bear an inescapable duty to live and to minister in a way that is above reproach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we get to a place where we agree. <strong>What I&rsquo;m led to wonder is if the term &ldquo;above reproach&rdquo; means something significantly different to Pastors Mohler, Dever, and Duncan than it means to me.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-gospel-coalition">The Gospel Coalition</h3>
<p><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2013/05/24/why-we-have-been-silent-about-the-sgm-lawsuit/">TGC&rsquo;s statement (&ldquo;Why We Have Been Silent about the SGM Lawsuit&rdquo;)</a> was published this morning as a statement from Don Carson, Justin Taylor, and Kevin DeYoung. It&rsquo;s slightly less troubling than the T4G statement&hellip; but only slightly.</p>
<p>They acknowledge up front that their silence could indeed feel like a betrayal to those who suffered abuse, and that pastors hold a responsibility to obey all civil mandatory reporting laws in addition to overseeing church discipline. (This is a lesson that, by all accounts, SGM <em>badly</em> needed to learn.)</p>
<p>However, then TGC turns on the alleged victims, claiming that the conspiracy charges against Mahaney were underhandedly and unfairly manufactured, and praising the statute of limitations as &ldquo;an important feature of our legal system&rdquo;.</p>
<p>My question is this: why should church leaders be so happy to escape due to the statute of limitations? Regardless of the legal limitations, shouldn&rsquo;t the charges be fully investigated by the church, and discipline enacted accordingly? <strong>God is not restrained by any statute of limitations.</strong></p>
<p>TGC goes on to encourage us to let the litigation to play out, to hear both sides, to not assume all allegations or false, and to not assume that all defendants are guilty. Good stuff. I could&rsquo;ve almost been happy with their statement until this final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reports on the lawsuit from <em>Christianity Today</em> and <em>World Magazine</em> (among others) explicitly and repeatedly drew attention to C. J., connecting the suit to recent changes within SGM. He has also been the object of libel and even a Javert-like obsession by some.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we are. &ldquo;Javert-like obsession.&rdquo; TGC has now turned the tables. The victims of abuse are now the accusers, and Mahaney, the head of an organization that allegedly let the abuse run rampant, is the victim.</p>
<p>For shame.</p>
<p><em>“Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.&quot; Luke 12:1-3</em></p>
<p><em>“If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.&quot; Matthew 18:6</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;&hellip;the truth will set you free.” John 8:32</em></p>

			 <p>Matthew Johnson alerted me yesterday to the trailer that&rsquo;s out for a movie about Rich Mullins. Before I comment, here&rsquo;s the trailer:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF7qbCTFja0">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Honestly, my first thought was that it&rsquo;s been more than 15 years since Rich died in a car accident, and I&rsquo;m still not really ready to see a movie. All the trailer&rsquo;s foreshadowing with him driving in the Jeep is enough to bring tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>I never met Rich Mullins or even saw him play a concert, and yet he remains my most significant musical influence. I listened to his records (well, cassette tapes and CDs) over and over and over through high school and college. I sang his songs. I learned his piano riffs. After he died I organized a little band to do a 4-song memorial tribute to him in our college chapel service. I guarantee you if you sat me down at a piano I could play and sing at least three dozen of his songs from memory.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my other hang-up with the movie: I know Rich almost exclusively from his songs. Do I really want to deal with some other writer&rsquo;s dramatization, and some actor&rsquo;s impression, of his life? Maybe not.</p>
<p>Instead, I kicked up iTunes and started on a bender playing through Rich&rsquo;s classic albums <em>The World As Best As I Can Remember It, Vol. 1 and 2</em>, <em>Never Picture Perfect</em>, and <em>A Liturgy, A Legacy, and A Ragamuffin Band</em>. You guys can let me know how the movie turns out, but those records may be all of the Rich I ever really need to know.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/05/22/a-plea-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-05-22 20:05:18 -0500">May 22, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s been <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/abusive-theology-piper-mahaney">a lot of blogospheric noise</a> today around a tweet that Pastor John Piper made yesterday in the aftermath of the Oklahoma tornado. Piper quoted two verses from Job. After a lot of furor around those tweets, Piper first deleted those tweets, then tweeted something more clearly comforting. Finally, this afternoon the Desiring God website posted <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/those-deleted-tweets">a clarification article</a>, explaining that Pastor John&rsquo;s motivation for his original tweet and his following actions.</p>
<p>Ever since childhood I&rsquo;ve been the youngster advising the older ones on technology. At the risk of impertinence, there are a few things about the use of social media that I&rsquo;d like to offer as advice to Pastor John (or any of us using Twitter, <em>et al</em>.).</p>
<p><strong>There is value in using social media.</strong> Let me start by commending you, Pastor John, for using Twitter in the first place. The internet has provided us many ways to communicate, and it takes courage and wisdom to dive in at all. Keep at it! Even if folks regularly disagree with you, the message is getting out.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s really easy for things to be taken out of context.</strong> Especially when you only get 140 characters at a time. I don&rsquo;t think I need to say more.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing on the internet ever really goes away.</strong> Yes, Twitter provides that nifty delete button. I use it myself once in a while - usually when I make an embarrassing typo that I want to correct. But especially for those with a large following, things never really disappear. It takes only a second to make a screenshot of a tweet or a web page, and then that image can persist forever.</p>
<p><strong>You cause more questions by deleting.</strong> In my experience, it almost always raises more attention to have deleted the offending tweet or blog post than it would to leave the post in place and follow it up. This is especially true on Twitter, where tweets are usually just seen once as they flow through someone&rsquo;s timeline. There&rsquo;s no great additional harm done in leaving the tweet up, but it feeds furor and suspicion when you take it down.</p>
<p><strong>Use the same channel to apologize.</strong> A pastor of mine once advised that my apology for an offense should be as public (or private) as the original offense. In this case, it would be wise to offer the apology on the same channel as the offense. It&rsquo;s clear from the DG post, Pastor John, that you meant no harm or offense to those suffering from the storm, and your follow-up tweet helped clarify. But the contrition in the DG post would&rsquo;ve been magnified had it been expressed on Twitter not as a link to a long blog, but simply as a tweet or two.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;ll probably happen again.</strong> Here I speak from personal experience. I&rsquo;ve posted things via social media before that I now regret and repent of. Sadly, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do so again. So these thoughts are just as much a reminder to me as they are a plea to an older brother.</p>
<p><em>May the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</em></p>

			 <p>Andrew Peterson has <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2013/05/facing-the-truth/">a beautiful piece up at The Rabbit Room</a> today. He reflects on his discomfort at answering personal questions on a doctor&rsquo;s questionnaire, and the dichotomy between what he <em>wants to think he is</em> and what he <em>actually is</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you see, the story we tell ourselves is skewed. There comes a time when we need to sit and take account of how we’re spending our lives, like at the doctor’s office or with the budget, and be reminded that we are not who we think we are. We need Jesus more than we allow ourselves to admit. We are not really so much better than the people around us whose lives are so obviously messy. In fact, we’re not better at all. They may in fact be closer to the heart of Jesus because they are humble enough to admit to themselves that they need help, humble enough to answer the hard questions about their weakness boldly.</p>

			 <p>Songwriter and singer Jennifer Knapp <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/ask-jennifer-knapp-response">answered questions over on Rachel Held Evans' blog this week</a>, and in the midst of it all she offered up a devastatingly spot-on critique of Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) and how it reflects the attitude of the evangelical church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this sense CCM reflects our Christian culture very well. It is our Christian culture to invite those to tell only the story of victory and spare the gruesome details of the scarring war. We can reside if we are made clean and presentable, those who are still writing their story must wait for absolute victory before they can share it with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but from my experience, she&rsquo;s right on.</p>
<p>When we hear testimonies in church, or smaller gatherings like men&rsquo;s groups or (I would assume) women&rsquo;s groups, etc, the stories we are told are only, as Jennifer calls them, &ldquo;stories of victory&rdquo;. How someone battled their demons, their besetting sin, and hallelujah, with Jesus' help they came out victorious.</p>
<p>And sure, it&rsquo;s encouraging. Stories of victory provide hope that there <em>is</em> victory to be had.</p>
<p>But when was the last time you heard a testimony that said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do this sin, but I did it again this week. So I&rsquo;m repenting again and I&rsquo;m going to God for grace.&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go even further. If, by some odd happenstance, someone <em>does</em> confess struggles with sin in a church meeting, what gets confessed is a &ldquo;respectable&rdquo; sin. Pride. A bad attitude. Shortness with a spouse. Failure to have a regular quiet time.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard a testimony where someone confessed an ongoing, painful struggle with alcohol, or pornography, or anger, or financial honesty? Not a story of victory, but a story of the pain of the &ldquo;scarring war&rdquo;? I never have.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I think this means:</p>
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t really believe in the gospel of grace and forgiveness.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we give it lip service. But what good is the message of grace and forgiveness when the only time we acknowledge it is for stories of victory, for people who have experienced absolute victory?</p>
<p>Yes, Jesus said &ldquo;Go and sin no more&rdquo;. We put fancy words on it and call it &ldquo;progressive sanctification&rdquo;. But sanctification will progress at different rates sometimes. One brother may experience a sudden change and never go back to drunkenness; another may fight the bottle his whole life. To only affirm and share the stories of the former is tacit acknowledgment that what we really value is not the grace but the works.</p>
<p>I can hear some objector ready to quote me Romans 6:1. &ldquo;Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? May it never be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: <strong>we will all continue in sin for the rest of our lives</strong>. For some of us it&rsquo;ll be the same sin. Others will retire old sins only to find and wrestle with new ones. We don&rsquo;t want to, but we will. See Romans 7.</p>
<p>But when we silence the stories of the ongoing, painful, scarring battle, <strong>we are hampering the bountiful endowment of grace</strong>.</p>
<p>In God there is an abundance of grace. Powerful. Rich. Saving. Free. Not designed only for those who have already cleaned up their act.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not do anything to withhold it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/05/01/a-year-off.html">A year off the Internet</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2013/05/01/a-year-off.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-05-01 12:17:30 -0500">May 1, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tech writer Paul Miller spent a year unplugged from the internet, and returns today to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet">share his insights</a>.</p>
<p>Paul reports that while the first few months disconnected were freeing and encouraged him to read more deeply, write more, and do more recreational activities, what he found after several months went by is that this &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t all he had thought it might be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say exactly what changed. I guess those first months felt so good because I felt the absence of the pressures of the internet. My freedom felt tangible. But when I stopped seeing my life in the context of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use the internet,&rdquo; the offline existence became mundane, and the worst sides of myself began to emerge.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I would stay at home for days at a time. My phone would die, and nobody could get ahold of me. At some point my parents would get fed up with wondering if I was alive, and send my sister over to my apartment to check on me. On the internet it was easy to assure people I was alive and sane, easy to collaborate with my coworkers, easy to be a relevant part of society.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So much ink has been spilled deriding the false concept of a &ldquo;Facebook friend,&rdquo; but I can tell you that a &ldquo;Facebook friend&rdquo; is better than nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul says that while he thought he might find his &ldquo;real&rdquo; self disconnected from the Internet, instead he realized that his &ldquo;real self&rdquo; and his online interactions were rather inextricably linked.</p>
<p>He relates a conversation with a young relative during a recent visit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My last afternoon in Colorado I sat down with my 5-year-old niece, Keziah, and tried to explain to her what the internet is. She&rsquo;d never heard of &ldquo;the internet,&rdquo; but she&rsquo;s huge on Skype with the grandparent set. I asked her if she&rsquo;d wondered why I never Skyped with her this year. She had.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;I thought it was because you didn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she said.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
With tears in my eyes, I drew her a picture of what the internet is. It was computers and phones and televisions, with little lines connecting them. Those lines are the internet. I showed her my computer, drew a line to it, and erased that line.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;I spent a year without using any internet,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;But now I&rsquo;m coming back and I can Skype with you again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, Miller has decided, <em>being connected</em> with those he loves is more important than whatever &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; his technological disconnection provided.</p>
<p>Miller&rsquo;s story highlights many of the concerns that have gone through my head whenever I have considered &ldquo;unplugging&rdquo; in some way or another. Yes, I might gain back some &ldquo;free time&rdquo;. Yes, I might be better able to sit down and read 200 pages at a single go instead of 20. (Wait, I have 3 small kids - what am I thinking? 200 pages is a pipe dream.)</p>
<p>But my friendships and social interactions over the past decade have been hugely influenced and enabled by technology. I&rsquo;ve made friends over Twitter, and blogs, and forums; people that aren&rsquo;t just &lsquo;creepy internet friends&rsquo; but that have become real, embodied friends when we&rsquo;ve had the chance to meet in person.</p>
<p>So when I think of disconnecting the way Paul Miller did, the first word that comes to my mind is &ldquo;lonely&rdquo;. Which means, for better or worse, I&rsquo;m going to be staying connected.</p>

			 <p>We made a family trip to the library yesterday, and as usual I came home with a pile of books and media beyond what I am ever to get through in the three weeks I&rsquo;m allowed to borrow them. I did, however, manage to work my way through the four new (to me) CDs that I borrowed.</p>
<p>In the order I listened to them at work today:</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_(The_Velvet_Underground_album)">Loaded</a></em> - The Velvet Underground.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c9508cf5d3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never listened to The Velvet Underground before today. I found them enjoyable in that early 1970&rsquo;s rock-and-roll way. Nothing too profound, but very listenable.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_Music_Society">Chamber Music Society</a></em> - Esperanza Spalding.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1406aa8c9f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Jazz, anybody? Spalding is another new artist to me, and wowza. The woman plays bass and holy cow can she sing. Fantastic jazz. This one is a keeper.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_at_Leeds">Live at Leeds</a></em> - The Who.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/668f65902f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m typically a fan of live records, but this one didn&rsquo;t really grab me. Maybe I&rsquo;m not enough of an aficionado of The Who. I dunno. Turned this one off about four tracks in. Really couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to care.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Weekend_(album)">Vampire Weekend</a></em> - Vampire Weekend.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7112767301.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve owned Vampire Weekend&rsquo;s <em>Contra</em> for a couple of years now and enjoy it OK. But when I heard my friend <a href="http://okaywhatever.com/">Dan</a> complain a while back (on some social media - can&rsquo;t remember which or when) that he hated <em>Contra</em> and hoped that VW&rsquo;s new record would be more like their older stuff, I took a mental note to explore their other stuff.</p>
<p>And (no real surprise here) Dan was right. This eponymous record is, on first listen, far superior to <em>Contra</em>. Less frantic, more interesting melodies and instrumentations. I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t drop the F-bomb - makes it less friendly for playing when the kids are around - but on the whole, yeah, this one bears multiple listens as well.</p>
<p>Thus ends Chris&rsquo;s random update on new (to me) music.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Satan, I think, strikes a few of his best blows when he can persuade us that God is boring. That life with our Savior is a dull and dutiful upward climb toward a summit of righteousness always a little out of reach. We are close to defeat when we start to believe that God cares nothing for joy, that holy people are wage slaves to long days of righteousness. Work, pray, endure, and pay your bills, check off that list of upright deeds. And the image of God in our weary minds becomes that of a long-faced master whose only concern is our efficient goodness. We forget that we are called to a King who laughs and creates, sings and saves. That our end is a kingdom crammed with our heart’s desires. We forget that our God is the Lord of the dance and the one whose new world begins with a feast.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/601-bigger-than-you-think-the-vatican-and-its-annexes">fascinating post up on the Strange Maps blog this morning</a> about Vatican City and the Holy See. Vatican City, it seems, is not exactly what you think it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Vatican City is not what you think it is. It is <em>not</em> the diplomatic interface between the Catholic Church and the rest of the world. <em>That</em> role is played by the Holy See, which exchanges ambassadors with most of the world&rsquo;s countries (rather than Vatican City). Rather, Vatican City is the toehold of sovereign territory that gives the papacy its peace of mind: the territorial buffer shielding the Church&rsquo;s sovereignty rather than the essence of that sovereignty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then follows up with a bunch of interesting maps detailing the geographic boundaries of the tiny Vatican City (only 1/6 of a square mile in area!).</p>
<p>An interesting read.</p>

<p>&hellip;the pursuit of moral purity often undermines the life of welcome as &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; and the morally &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; tend to be shunned and excluded. The church stories we all could share illustrating this dynamic would provide ample evidence of the dynamics Unclean [Beck&rsquo;s recent book] was trying to describe.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So what&rsquo;s the trick? How are we to pursue holiness in a way that makes us more hospitable rather than less?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I think a part of the trick is this: holiness is a <em>first-person</em> rather than a <em>third-person</em> enterprise. Holiness is a <em>personal</em> rather than <em>public</em> affair.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the long-term hallmarks of the American evangelical church has been a congregational independence free from strong denominational ties. Sure, the denominations exist as broad placeholders with certain doctrinal distinctives, but the range of actual beliefs and practices among churches even within a single denomination is often large. In practice, theological interpretations mainly happen at the individual congregation level. This seems reasonable given that the popularly accepted definition of evangelicalism includes &ldquo;biblicism&rdquo; as one of its four key characteristics. [ref]Per British historian David Bebbington as referenced in <a href="http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term">this Wheaton College post</a>. The other three characteristics are conversionism, activism, and crucicentrism.[/ref]</p>
<p>Within less-evangelical denominations that have a well-defined hierarchy, doctrinal disputes and practice are better kept in-house; the Presbyterians are more than willing to govern their doctrine and practice, and the Catholics have their <em>magisterium</em> - the teaching authority of the church which speaks authoritatively on doctrine.</p>
<p>While Reformed Evangelicalism is still loosely grouped into tribes (Acts 29, The Gospel Coalition, Southern Seminary alumni, etc.), I think we are seeing the emergence of a Reformed Evangelical magisterium of sorts. Its hand has been evident the past several months in the reaction to, among other things, <a href="http://www.rachelheldevans.com">Rachel Held Evans</a>' new book. I don&rsquo;t want to address the book in this post - I did that previously - but rather the reaction to it.</p>
<p>Let me say up front that I have great respect for everyone I&rsquo;m going to mention here, and that I have learned much from and appreciated the teaching of nearly all of them. My goal here is not to suggest that they have nefarious intents or are necessarily intentionally working to form this sort of authoritative cabal, but that its emergence may point to a lack of confidence in the sufficiency of the tenet of biblicism.</p>
<p>Seeing the organization of this Reformed Evangelical cabal isn&rsquo;t difficult. There is a nicely defined structure that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>theological institutions (Southern Seminary being the chief example)</li>
<li>theologians - D. A. Carson, Albert Mohler, Wayne Grudem, John Piper, Mark Dever</li>
<li>charismatic teachers - Mark Driscoll, Matt Chandler, Voddie Baucham, Josh Harris, C. J. Mahaney</li>
<li>mouthpieces - The Gospel Coalition website, Desiring God&rsquo;s website, and The Resurgence website, among others</li>
<li>inquisitors - Tim Challies and Kevin DeYoung being the prime examples</li>
<li>councils - we call &lsquo;em conferences, though. Desiring God holds a big one every year, T4G is every other year, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a member gets too far out of line, this group is quietly self-regulating. See: <a href="/12/03/some-thoughts-on-matt-chandlers-move-to-lead-acts-29/">Acts29 moving from Driscoll in Seattle to Chandler in Dallas</a>. See also Mahaney leaving his Maryland church of nearly 30 years under a cloud, only to re-emerge as <a href="http://www.sovereigngraceministries.org/blogs/sgm/post/Church-planter-interview-CJ-Mahaney-(Louisville-KY).aspx">pastor of a new church in Louisville, KY</a>, safely in Al Mohler&rsquo;s backyard.</p>
<p>Among the larger group of individual pastors that follow these leaders, doctrinal alignment is maintained by conferences and publishers. As an aspiring author, your first book likely won&rsquo;t get a look from one of the big names, but if Challies reviews it positively, your second one might. A cover blurb from Driscoll, Keller, or Chandler will help ensure that your book gets accepted at the book sales room at the next conference, and from there you&rsquo;re all set on your track to successful blogging, authoring, and maybe even your own speaking gig at the next conference!</p>
<p>Get a vote of disapproval, though, and you&rsquo;ll be on the outside looking in, anywhere from just being ignored (which I&rsquo;d imagine is bad for an author&rsquo;s prospects) to having the full court press turned against you (as Rachel Held Evans has had the past few months).</p>
<p>Now, from one perspective, this sort of unity seems like a positive thing, right? We have Baptists, Presbyterians, Free Church-ians, and independents of every stripe coming &ldquo;Together for the Gospel&rdquo;. And indeed, this tent is apparently big enough for diversity on sacramental issues like baptism and communion. But touch one of the &ldquo;third rails&rdquo; like women&rsquo;s roles or origins and you&rsquo;re gonna get dropped like a hot potato. (Recently a professor at Cedarville College got fired because he believed the &ldquo;right things&rdquo; about Adam and Eve but <em><a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november/crisis-of-faith-statements.html">not for the right reasons</a></em>.)</p>
<p>A few of the authors who go where angels fear to tread are given a grudging pass, typically because their academic credentials are too impressive to totally ignore. Think here of Scot McKnight, whose <em>Junia Is Not Alone</em> argues hard for the egalitarian position, but who also taught at TEDS alongside D. A. Carson. And also, oh, that N. T. Wright guy who says some amazingly liberal stuff on social gospel and the environment, but who wrote some stunning stuff on Jesus.</p>
<p>Academic credentials don&rsquo;t ensure asbestos underwear, though. Pete Enns (a tenured professor) got <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/aprilweb-only/114-24.0.html">run out of Westminster Seminary</a>, Philadelphia, back in 2008 after publishing his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801027306/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0801027306&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Inspiration and Incarnation</a>, which argued for a re-evaluation of how we read and interpret the Bible - and especially the early parts of the Old Testament. And if you&rsquo;re a woman without a theology degree, like the aforementioned Evans, well, sorry. You&rsquo;re toast.</p>
<p>Ask any of these guys (or your local adherents to their creed) why they put the big focus on these specific doctrinal issues, and what you&rsquo;ll probably hear is this: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2011/02/01/creation-vs-evolution-the-new-shape-of-the-debate/">the gospel is at stake</a>&rdquo;. I think it&rsquo;s clear, though, that what it really means is &ldquo;our version of the gospel is at stake&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And this is where the idea of a magisterium comes in. In the Catholic tradition, the magisterium is the teaching authority of the church. The church leadership speaks an authoritative interpretation of Scripture, and the matter is settled.</p>
<p>In the evangelical tradition, however, we don&rsquo;t have the strong denominational and hierarchical structures to pronounce and enforce Scriptural interpretation. And even though we love the Scripture (a pastor I know and love proudly says he has such a high view of Scripture that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not bibliolatry&hellip; but *wink* it&rsquo;s just almost bibliolatry.&quot;), it&rsquo;s apparent that while we also love our congregational independence, that independence is just insufficient to protect the evangelical doctrinal turf. And so evangelicalism falls back on its informal magisterium.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think one can conclude from all this that a magisterium is a bad thing, nor can one conclude that the solution is to move our evangelical churches into some hierarchical denomination. But what is clear is that no matter how loudly some leaders of evangelicalism may cry that we need to simply &ldquo;believe what the Bible says&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s never quite that simple.</p>

			 <p>My friend Geof wrote a good post yesterday about <a href="http://gfmorris.net/2013/01/22/adam-omelianchuk-on-rachel-held-evans-me-on-authority-in-book-reviewing/">really taking time to digest and consider a book before publishing a review</a>. He appreciates his friend Adam for taking 6 months before responding to Rachel Held Evans' book. (I&rsquo;m curious whether Adam&rsquo;s really been chewing on it for a while or whether he just took a while to get to the book in the first place, but that&rsquo;s only tangential to Geof&rsquo;s point.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to any book review, I simply question context: who is the reviewer, and does it seem that they’ve taken the time to read it well? Often the former is easily deduced—this is the Internet—but one never really knows if a book has been carefully considered or read simply to be discarded&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&hellip;I think you need to spend time thinking about a book <em>if you are going to lend/demand authority to your response to the reading.</em> I think that too many high-profile theology types rush through book reviews purely knowing that their authority rests in their brand. I think that’s a dangerous mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geof has a good point here, and I wonder how <a href="/12/11/rachel-held-evans-a-year-of-biblical-womanhood/">my own review of Rachel&rsquo;s book</a> would change if I read it again now that I&rsquo;ve had time to think and interact with others about it.</p>
<p>Geof omitted, though, another critical aspect of why the big-name theo-review-bloggers rush through their reads and get their reviews out early: <em>control</em>. These theo-review-bloggers want to direct their readers' purchases in ways that they think are &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. If a critical review will keep a &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; book out of hundreds of hands, let&rsquo;s get it published ASAP. Waiting for six months to publish a review might allow time for those folks to buy the book, read it, and *gasp* think about it for themselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I appreciate good book recommendations, and I appreciate folks telling me when a book might be a waste of my time. But Geof is right - there&rsquo;s far more authority to be had when you&rsquo;ve ruminated on a book over time before reviewing than when your release-day review is ***DO NOT WANT OMG HERESY STAY AWAY***.</p>

			 <p>A couple weeks ago <a href="/13/01/verizon-wireless-woes/">I wrote about my frustrations</a> with Verizon&rsquo;s service when it came to the issues my wife was having with her new iPhone. At the time, they were shipping out a new SIM card, in hopes that would fix the issue.</p>
<p>That SIM card showed up on a Friday afternoon, and the rest of that Friday was rather frustrating. When I installed the SIM card, it wouldn&rsquo;t activate. 10-minute call to customer support and that problem was fixed. So then I tried calling the phone, but had the same issue as before - most calls were going straight to voice mail.</p>
<p>So later on that evening I tried the chat route for customer support. I spent nearly an hour on chat support with a second-level tech named Sonia. She tried a bunch of things, including disabling voice mail, to see if any of them would allow calls to consistently ring through. No such luck. She said she&rsquo;d file a help ticket with the network engineers and follow up with me in a couple of days.</p>
<p>No sooner did I get off of chat with her than I realized that my wife&rsquo;s voice mail hadn&rsquo;t been set back up correctly&hellip; which meant that then not only would her phone not ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t get the voice messages either. Not acceptable. So, I called in to Verizon tech support. (For those of you counting, that&rsquo;s three separate sessions with tech support on the same day.)</p>
<p>This time I got a friendly guy from Arkansas who spent 10 minutes getting voice mail fixed, and then another 45 trying to figure out why calls weren&rsquo;t going through. He found a few more settings on his end that were screwed up, but nothing seemed to fix the issue. Eventually he gave up, confirmed that the help ticket had been filed, texted me that ticket number, and said good night.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear anything over the weekend, but on the following Monday I got a phone call from Sonia (the tech I&rsquo;d chatted with on Friday). She told me that the network guys had investigated and said the network was working perfectly, so that it must be the phone. Verizon overnighted a new iPhone 5 out via Fedex.</p>
<p>Once the new phone showed up that Tuesday, it was a pretty quick process to swap the SIM card and restore the phone from a backup. I held my breath and dialed her number&hellip; and it rang. I hung up and dialed again. It rang again. A half-dozen calls later, the phone rang every time. Success! As she started using the phone she also found that some other things that seemed weird with the old phone were fixed on the new one. (For instance: the volume buttons weren&rsquo;t adjusting call volume during a call.)</p>
<p>My conclusion: find the right Verizon techs and they&rsquo;ll get things done. And the iPhone 5 is amazing, but given that we&rsquo;re each on our second phone within the first two months, maybe Apple has a few quality issues to work out.</p>

			 <p>Last week Amazon introduced something called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_368903402_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=5946775011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=ilm&amp;pf_rd_r=1XXWYXGHV3R3BXYB6VZ1&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1465599902&amp;pf_rd_i=163856011">AutoRip</a>. Basic premise: you buy a physical CD from Amazon, and if it&rsquo;s AutoRip eligible, Amazon will give you a digital copy of the CD in your Amazon Cloud Drive, <em>gratis</em>. I presume this is Amazon&rsquo;s way of trying to push some physical-only CD folks into the cloud, and hey, it doesn&rsquo;t seem bad for any of us.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m curious about, though, and haven&rsquo;t seen addressed anywhere, is the impact this might have on the pricing models for digital-only purchases.</p>
<p>Last night my wife headed over to Amazon looking to purchase an older CD of Jim Brickman lullabies - something instrumental for a kid to listen to at night. The MP3 version of the album is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00157P6J2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00157P6J2">currently offered on Amazon for $9.99</a>.</p>
<p>But wait, what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That&rsquo;s right, this album is also available with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HMHSC2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002HMHSC2">a physical CD and AutoRip</a>. <strong>For $8.57.</strong> And that CD happens to have free shipping with our Amazon Prime membership.</p>
<p>Which means that it was $1.42 <em>cheaper</em> for my wife to get the MP3 downloads if she agreed to have Amazon ship her a physical copy of the disc as well. Something is wrong with that picture.</p>
<p>While this CD may be an unusual case, it&rsquo;s by no means unique. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009XC8RZ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009XC8RZ6">original cast recording of Les Miserables</a> is currently featured on Amazon&rsquo;s &ldquo;recently released AutoRip CDs&rdquo; page at $18.99 for MP3s or $16.99 for the physical CD + AutoRip.</p>
<p>Other CDs on that page have pricing that seems to be more the right way &lsquo;round - a recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009G7ZYPY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009G7ZYPY">Susan Boyle CD is $10.99 Physical/$5.00 MP3</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009F6RFF8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009F6RFF8">Toby Keith CD at $11.88/$6.99</a> - but some are awfully close to parity, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097RFAJI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097RFAJI">a Lady Antebellum CD at $10/$9.49</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RNYL0M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008RNYL0M">a Jason Aldean CD for $9.99/$8.99</a>.</p>
<p>Impacts to the pricing model may be one reason keeping Amazon from extending something useful like AutoRip to books as well. It sure doesn&rsquo;t seem like offering physical + digital cheaper than digital only is a money-making proposition.</p>

			 <p>My primary instrument has always been (and likely always will be) keys of some sort. I started piano lessons when I was 7. I started playing for church at age 14. I first started playing with a church worship band in college at age 19. I&rsquo;ve led worship while playing the piano hundreds of times. Those fingers on the keys at the top of my blog are my fingers, playing piano at my sister&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>Back in high school I taught myself to play guitar, and I&rsquo;m a reasonable hack there, though my fingerings are never very clean. From there I did a lot of playing bass lines on the guitar, though I&rsquo;ve only played bass as part of a band a handful of times. Keys are where it&rsquo;s at for me. And that&rsquo;s worked to fill the need where I&rsquo;ve been. After college there haven&rsquo;t been an abundance of other keyboardists.</p>
<p>For the last year or so, though, while I love playing keys in the worship band, the instruments that are in my head all the time, the ones I dream about playing, are bass and drums. I&rsquo;m not sure why. Maybe because so much of the music I listen to is guitar/bass/drums driven instead of piano-driven? Maybe I&rsquo;m just getting bored with piano right now?</p>
<p>In reality, I&rsquo;m a passable bass player. I can keep tempo on the drums, but one listen to a <em>real</em> drummer (of which we have several at church) quickly reminds me that I&rsquo;m just a hack. (Of course, I have no practice&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;d pick it up quickly?)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where this leaves me or even really what my conclusion is. It&rsquo;s just odd to observe that after having piano ingrained in my brain for almost 30 years, I&rsquo;m now doing a lot of my primary thinking in terms of other instruments. (It&rsquo;s suppose it&rsquo;s also entirely possible that piano is just <em>so</em> ingrained that I don&rsquo;t notice it any more.)</p>

			 <p>Back around Thanksgiving my wife and I made the jump from US Cellular to Verizon, for the express purpose of getting iPhones. And I&rsquo;ve gotta say, as a first-time iPhone owner: the iPhone 5 is <em>fantastic</em>. The hardware is exemplary. Everything happens quickly, the Apple software is (mostly) beautiful and (almost always) consistent, and the battery life&hellip; well, the battery life is almost unbelievable after my two years as a Galaxy S owner.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks, though, we&rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my wife&rsquo;s telephone. Mine works just fine, but if you try to call her, about 90% of the time it&rsquo;ll ring twice on your end and go straight to voice mail. She never even gets an indication that someone is trying to call. She can be in the same room as me, with good signal, etc, but while calls to me work just fine, calls to her get re-routed. (She gets texts just fine.)</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve entered the Verizon support hassle. First call to tech support started with 10 minutes on hold. After that a helpful support gal looked into some network settings, tried calling my wife&rsquo;s phone, and after two consecutive calls got through, declared the phone fixed. Once we hung up I tried calling my wife from <em>my</em> phone and it went straight to VM. Then I tried calling her phone via Google Talk&rsquo;s free calling service, and that, too, went straight to VM. Four times in a row.</p>
<p>My next attempt has been via <a href="http://twitter.com/VZWSupport">@VZWSupport</a> on Twitter. It took about two days to finally get some action from them, but after some short diagnostic questions they now have a new SIM card headed out to us via Fedex. Guess we&rsquo;ll see if that solves the problem. A Google search for this issue leads me to believe that the new SIM card might just be step 1 in a longer tech-support dance, but seeing as it&rsquo;s a new year I&rsquo;ll try to hold out hope for a quicker solution.</p>

			 <p>Time for my annual roundup of what I read over the past year. While I&rsquo;m often lousy at cataloging things, this list is easy enough thanks to Goodreads and their nice little iPhone app.</p>
<p>(If you just want to look at the list, go <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101?shelf=2012-reads">check it out over on Goodreads</a>.)</p>
<p>I read 59 books this year. 36 were fiction, 23 were non-fiction. Most of that non-fiction was theology, with just a couple of biographies / histories thrown in. (I need to read some more history. I don&rsquo;t read enough of it anymore.)</p>
<p>I rated far more things with five stars this year than I have in previous years. (15 books got 5 stars! That&rsquo;s more than a quarter of everything I read!) I don&rsquo;t know whether that means my rating standards are slipping or that my book selection standards are improving, but at least it means I have some good books to recommend.</p>
<p>There are five novels I gave five stars this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615325424/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0615325424">The Fiddler&rsquo;s Gun</a></em> by A. S. Peterson - a fun Revolutionary War novel focused on the adventures of a teenage girl. (I&rsquo;ve got the sequel, <em>The Fiddler&rsquo;s Green</em>, sitting in my to-read pile&hellip; should get it read in 2013 sometime.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525478817/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0525478817"><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em></a> by John Green - a short Young Adult novel focused on two teenagers who are dying of cancer. It&rsquo;s not as painful as it sounds, but it&rsquo;s challenging and insightful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765316994/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0765316994"><em>Redshirts</em></a>, by John Scalzi - an odd sort of meta sci-fi romp that otherwise defies comparison</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060574607/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060574607">The Book of the Dun Cow</a></em> by Walter Wangerin, Jr. - a fascinating fantasy story which I&rsquo;m indebted to the Rabbit Room folks for recommending.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477599983/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1477599983">Gathering String</a></em>, by Mimi Johnson - a top-notch suspense/mystery novel whose author is a lovely lade I met once at a tweetup in Cedar Rapids.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the non-fiction side, there were more 5-star books, but a few among those that particularly stood out:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594136149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594136149">Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President</a></em> by Candace Millard - a fascinating tale of the election and assassination of President James Garfield.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250024056/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1250024056">When I Was a Child I Read Books</a></em> by Marilynne Robinson. - This book of essays by the Iowa City author and professor is dense in the very best sense of the word. Thoughtful, insightful pieces on life and theology.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592448747/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592448747">An Ethic for Christians and Other Aliens in a Strange Land</a></em> by William Stringfellow - powerful social critique of organizational and governmental &ldquo;powers and principalities&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m back at the reading for 2013, trying to finish up some Thomas Merton that I started back in December.

			 <p>For at least twenty years my mother has been requesting that I record some of my piano stylings. For one reason and another I&rsquo;ve never gotten to it, until now. My mom got her copy last weekend when we celebrated Christmas with my side of the family, so now I&rsquo;m free and clear to share it with you all. I&rsquo;m calling it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0"><em>Carols for Christmas</em></a>.</p>
<p><img src="img%20src=%22https://chrishubbs.com/uploads/2024/carols-for-christmas-cover.jpeg%22%20width=%22571%22%20height=%22562%22%20alt=%22%22" alt="Carols for Christmas - photo credit to bterryhampton on Flickr."></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just over 30 minutes worth of music, all piano versions of traditional Christmas carols. There&rsquo;s not a lot in the way of production - I recorded them using my Casio midi controller keyboard in single takes in GarageBand and did a minimal amount of editing to remove the clunky notes. The perfectionist part of me wishes I had another 80 hours to really refine and polish the arrangements and recordings; the engineer in me has declared &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. The engineer won the debate this time.</p>
<p>So please enjoy <em>Carols for Christmas</em> as my gift to you this season. This <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/udiadekdc99akc6/AADzppw1KdFczRFiZaEZoU5Ea?dl=0">download link</a> will let you listen and/or download MP3s from Dropbox.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/12/13/advent-or-not.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-12-13 20:36:29 -0500">Dec 13, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>&lsquo;Tis the season of Advent, or at least lots of church bloggers are telling me. A time of anticipation, longing, and waiting. Even evangelical churches that aren&rsquo;t big on use of the church calendar seem to mark out the time for Advent.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s curious in a way. We evangelicals don&rsquo;t observe much of the rest of the traditional church calendar. Christmas? That&rsquo;s a single day. (That 12 Days of Christmas song is just some weird anachronism.) Pentecost? We remember the story, but don&rsquo;t mark the day. Lent? Heck no, that&rsquo;s a weird Catholic thing. Ascension? Is that even a thing we remember?</p>
<p>The churches I grew up in didn&rsquo;t follow the church calendar, so the only taste I got of it was when visiting my grandparents&rsquo; Lutheran church on occasion. <em>17th Sunday after Pentecost? What the what?</em> It&rsquo;s not until this past decade as I&rsquo;ve gained friends in more liturgical denominations that my awareness has been heightened to the greater observance of the calendar. (<a href="http://throughaglass.net">Kari</a>, for instance, has done some lovely posts on <a href="http://throughaglass.net/archives/2012/12/02/advent-i-preparing/">Advent</a>, <a href="http://throughaglass.net/archives/2012/02/29/habits/">Lent</a>, and <a href="http://throughaglass.net/archives/2009/06/11/an-elephants-faithful-one-hundred-percent/">Ordinary Time</a>.)</p>
<p>Seeing how the larger church observes the calendar helps me understand some of the celebrational whiplash that I feel throughout the year. <em>Why do they do Lent for 40 days but then Easter is just one day? Oh, Easter is actually supposed to be celebrated longer than just the day? *lightbulb*</em></p>
<p>It also helps me explain the dissonance I felt on the first Sunday in December when our church worship kicked off with <em>Angels We Have Heard on High</em>. (It was assuaged briefly this past week when we opened with <em>O Come, O Come, Emmanuel</em>, but quickly returned when we closed the service with <em>Joy to the World!</em>.)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I love the Christmas hymns. But it does feel like we miss something when we bypass all the anticipation and spread our Jesus-is-born celebration across the whole month of December.</p>
<p>Could it be that the anticipation of Advent is the tension that stretches the boundary between heaven and earth so thin that when we finally do reach Christmas Eve, our hearts can glimpse heaven breaking through?</p>
<p>At the end of Sally Lloyd-Jones' beautiful <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310708257/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0310708257&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Jesus Storybook Bible</a></em>, she writes about the revelation to John, and she says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day, John knew, Heaven would come down and mend God&rsquo;s broken world and make it our true, perfect home once again.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And he knew, in some mysterious way that would be hard to explain, that everything was going to be more wonderful for once having been so sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same way, Advent makes Christmas more wonderful, if only because the heightened anticipation makes us keenly ready to celebrate Jesus' birth.</p>
<p>Let us anticipate together His coming.</p>

<p>I think it may take the American evangelical church another decade or so to really realize how closely intertwined they are with the Republican party, but my prayer is that the realization hits sooner rather than later. What compounds the issue is that our view of American exceptionalism makes us prideful enough that we are resistant to learn from our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world on the topic.</p>

			 <p>The primary focus this election day is on the race for President, as well it should be. After I leave work I&rsquo;ll head over to my precinct to cast my ballot. (I just can&rsquo;t get into the early voting thing - I like voting in my neighborhood on the day of.) Unfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to vote for my favorite elected public official, since he&rsquo;s only on the ballot in one small township in Wisconsin. However, let me take a couple of paragraphs to remind us that elected officials serve in roles both great and small, and we should be thankful for all of them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is my dad. He serves as the town clerk for the tiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall,_Richland_County,_Wisconsin">township of Marshall in Richland County, Wisconsin</a>. He was first appointed to this post to fill out the term of the previous clerk. He has since been elected to the post at least once - maybe a couple of times, I can&rsquo;t keep track of their election cycles.</p>
<p>As township clerk, Dad is responsible for keeping the township&rsquo;s paperwork, paying the (few) employees, keeping the books, setting the agenda for and recording the town board meetings, running elections, and in general making sure the town&rsquo;s business is conducted efficiently and legally. For this he gets paid a minimal salary - not anywhere close to full-time, but maybe a little better than minimum wage. (Mom has been appointed the volunteer assistant town clerk so that she can cover township meetings if he&rsquo;s out of town.)</p>
<p>Town business is seemingly never done; any time we visit the phone seems to ring on a daily basis with some issue or another. Maybe the town patrolman (who drives the plow in the winter and fixes the roads in the summer) needs help with a persnickety citizen; maybe some citizen needs reassurance on why their property is being reassessed for tax purposes; maybe the town chairman wants to confirm the next meeting&rsquo;s business. Each phone call gets a patient and thorough discussion as Dad walks them through the issues.</p>
<p>The responsibility of running the elections is, by itself, a significant role - especially when you consider the number of elections that have been held in Wisconsin the past couple of years. During the recall effort for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, first there were primaries. Then there was the recall. Then there were some county elections sandwiched around those. Dad was running a different election every second or third week for a few months. Craziness.</p>
<p>There can&rsquo;t be many elected positions more minor than that of town clerk for a township of less than 600 people, but I&rsquo;m proud of my Dad for taking the responsibility seriously and serving the people in his township to the best of his ability. Today as we vote for our leaders at the highest levels, let&rsquo;s not forget the servants at the lowest levels, too. They are worthy of our respect, our prayers, and our thanks today and every day as they serve.</p>

			 <p>OK, I&rsquo;ve been back for almost two weeks now, I should finish up reporting on my India trip. At a minimum, I should describe my trip back home.</p>
<p>My itinerary to head back home started in Hyderabad, taking a Jet Airways (an Indian carrier) flight to Mumbai, then catching Delta back to Amsterdam, Atlanta, and finally Cedar Rapids. I had three and a half hours to make the transfer in Mumbai&hellip; that should be enough, right?</p>
<p>When I showed up to the Hyderabad airport, I had a small heart attack when the Jet Airways ticket agent told me that my seat had not been confirmed (even though my itinerary document said &lsquo;confirmed&rsquo;!) and that the plane was nearly full. I stood there and prayed as he made a phone call to see what could be done. Finally he did get me a seat - the last seat on the plane. Crisis #1 averted.</p>
<p>Made it through security and back to the terminal only to find that my flight had been delayed by 20 minutes. Suddenly I started getting more concerned about my connection. My concerns would end up being valid.</p>
<p>We finally got to Mumbai, where the process for transferring from the domestic to the international terminal is a bit involved. First you deplane and head down to baggage claim. You&rsquo;ve gotta pick up your checked bag and carry it with you. Then you stand in line for a shuttle bus to go between terminals. That shuttle only runs once every 30 minutes. To actually get on the bus you have to go through security (again), running your bags through the x-ray and getting wanded by a guard. The bus was getting full and it was looking like I wasn&rsquo;t going to fit. I pushed my way down the ramp and told the guy what time my flight was. He checked his watch, threw my bags underneath in the baggage compartment, and hustled me onto the already-full bus. Phew.</p>
<p>The ride to the terminal seemed to take forever. For what is no more than a 1-mile distance, I think the bus took 15 minutes to get there. We must&rsquo;ve covered every inch of terminal. And the bus doesn&rsquo;t drop you off any place convenient; it just stops by departure terminal entrance A. I needed to get to entrance D.</p>
<p>I hustled off the bus, grabbed my bags, and was helped out by one of the airport guys who works for tips. He asked my airline, grabbed one of my bags, and had me hustle with him down to entrance D. He got me to the end of the line and then asked for a tip. For $10, he said, he could get me through the lines. It ended up being the best $10 I spent on the trip.</p>
<p>With my $10 in his hand, he pushed to the front of the initial security line and shoved my passport and itinerary under the nose of the security officer. After getting waved along, we then rushed to the Delta counter. The Delta folks were asking if I was on the Amsterdam flight even before I could get to the counter. I shoved my passport at them, threw my checked bag on the belt, and within seconds they handed me back my boarding passes and passport and told me to run to the next line. Off I ran.</p>
<p>A Delta agent met me at that point and ran me up to security, cutting me nearly to the front of that line. After once again putting my bags through the x-ray and getting wanded, I then hustled off to the immigration line.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just a naif, but I didn&rsquo;t expect hundreds of people in the immigration line at midnight on a Friday night. Fortunately I was able to cut nearly to the front of the business class immigration line, joining four other Americans trying to make the same flight that I was. We picked the wrong immigration line, though. The guy checking our forms and passports was super-slow. The guy next to him was clearing 3 passengers for every 1 that cleared our line. But finally I cleared that line as well.</p>
<p>At that point the Delta agent pointed me in the direction of the gate and said &ldquo;go&rdquo;. So there I was, at this point just past the scheduled departure time for my flight, running down the Mumbai terminal at 1:00 AM. Made it to the gate, with gate agents waiting for us 5 to make the flight. Hustled down the jetway, only to have to go through security <em>again</em>, this time taking off my shoes. (I think I went through that screening a grand total of 5 times that Friday night. Crazy.)</p>
<p>Finally I was on the airplane, in my seat. Then it was just a nine-and-a-half hour flight to Amsterdam, a (more sane) transfer there, ten hours to Atlanta, a couple hours sitting there, and then two hours home.</p>
<p>If I do the India trip again, at a minimum I now know to schedule at least 5 hours for transfer between flights. I might also opt to fly Emirates Air, which goes from Hyderabad -&gt; Dubai -&gt; Chicago. (I do love the Delta miles, though&hellip;)</p>
<p>So that was my excitement on the trip home from India. I&rsquo;ve got one more post percolating with some final thoughts, which hopefully I can write up soon.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll get to a summary post or two about my India trip in upcoming days, but today I&rsquo;d rather go on about my frustration with my auxiliary home theater PC setup.</p>
<p>Basic review: my main HTPC setup works great. I&rsquo;m running Windows 7 on a tower with 2.5 TB of HDD and a Windows Media Center remote, and it all works very nicely, including the Netflix plugin for Windows Media Center. No complaints at all.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s driving me batty right now is my secondary setup up in my bedroom. For the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve actually been pretty happy using Plex on my Mac Mini as the setup; it can playback recorded TV across my network from the HTPC, the Netflix plugin worked nicely, and there was even a HDHomeRun plugin so I can watch live TV streaming from my networked tuner.</p>
<p>But a few months ago the Netflix plugin for Plex broke - rather, Netflix updated their API and the plugin developer hasn&rsquo;t been able to keep up. Which means the only good way to watch Netflix in that room (which the kids want to do nearly every morning) is to open up Netflix in the browser. Not such a good solution. So, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out another solution that won&rsquo;t cost me too much.</p>
<p>One option would be a <a href="http://www.roku.com/">Roku</a>. It has a good Netflix app, a Plex app which in theory will connect right up to my existing Plex Media Server to watch recorded TV, and even has an app for Amazon Streaming Video, which we get with our Prime membership but have never really used. (Bonus!) Downside: HDHomeRun doesn&rsquo;t work, and you don&rsquo;t get a basic web browser, which means no watching live TV, and no streaming any other video off the net from more, um, dubious sources.</p>
<p>I know that <a href="http://www.xbmc.org">XMBC</a> is floating around out there with a Mac app, but it&rsquo;s a pain in the rear to configure and not pretty at all, and I don&rsquo;t know that it even supports Netflix. So that&rsquo;s a non-starter.</p>
<p>A better option would be to buy a netbook computer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Z92SS6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007Z92SS6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">this 11&quot; Asus model</a> has good reviews) for about $300 and hook it up in place of the Mini. I could get another Windows Media Center remote and just duplicate my main install (save for the big disk drives). That way I know I&rsquo;d get Netflix, the HDHomeRun tuner would work, all the videos would playback (perhaps even without as much transcoding as I&rsquo;m doing now), and I&rsquo;d still have a browser. The downside: it&rsquo;d cost me $300. Even if I could sell the Mini, I&rsquo;d still be down a couple hundred bucks. That&rsquo;s <a href="/12/06/antihistamine-money/">antihistamine money</a>.</p>
<p>The other option that occurs to me is that I could do the same thing with the old Dell laptop that I&rsquo;m typing this post on. It&rsquo;s already got Win 7, and with a fresh Windows install it&rsquo;d be plenty fast enough. The downside is that this is the PC that the kids now use for their computer time, and where we&rsquo;ve got it setup isn&rsquo;t conducive to switching it out with the Mini.</p>
<p>Guess I&rsquo;ll keep thinking. Anybody have any good ideas?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After running through the options with my wife, she says &ldquo;$300 for the best option? Forget it. For $300 I can get out of bed and open a browser if they want to watch Netflix.&rdquo; Guess that answers the question.</p>

			 <p>I think it&rsquo;s a fair guess that I&rsquo;ve never spent 4 days talking non-stop for 8 hours each day before. My throat is feeling the effects of it. Amazingly, I still have a voice.</p>
<p>Last night one of the managers of our Indian facility took me and another guy from Iowa out to do some shopping and then to a team dinner of Indian food at a nice hotel. The hotel restaurant was so full that they had our (long) table set up poolside by their indoor pool. I&rsquo;m kicking myself now that I didn&rsquo;t take a picture of it. The shopping shall go undescribed to maintain some sense of anticipation for those receiving gifts.</p>
<p>Tonight I took the hotel&rsquo;s &ldquo;free shuttle&rdquo; to the nearby shopping mall to see what a western-style Indian shopping mall looked like. The &ldquo;free shuttle&rdquo; ended up being a three-wheeled motor rickshaw&hellip; quite an experience, even for just the mile between the hotel and the mall.</p>
<p>Tonight I have the joy of packing my bags in preparation for heading home. Tomorrow I check out, go to the office, then back to the hotel and start on my way home. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Just for the record, here&rsquo;s me after completing my fourth day of teaching.</p>

			 <p>Some thoughts from days 3 and 4 (Monday and Tuesday) of my India trip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting around doing nothing, by yourself, in an unfamiliar place is a lonely task. I was in tears missing my family on Monday morning when I saw that my 6-year-old had written me an IM overnight saying (her usual) &ldquo;addie hi dad&rdquo;. Hadn&rsquo;t been that homesick since my first night at college.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a lot better when you can spend your days working. Feels like I have purpose and a good reason for coming over here.</li>
<li>The people over here at our India Design Center are fantastic. Friendly, asking good questions, making me feel very welcome. I love it. I even got assigned my own office for the week!</li>
<li>It was amusing to come in early this morning and see several folks decorating the cubicle of a co-worker for her birthday today. Balloons! Streamers! Some things are apparently the same everywhere.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s kinda weird watching Monday Night Football on Tuesday morning while you&rsquo;re getting ready for work.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not used to talking all day, every day. This trip is exhausting not just from doing all the teaching, but from being &ldquo;on&rdquo; all the time. I&rsquo;m an introvert. This isn&rsquo;t easy.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve watched Indian TV a little bit, but mostly now I&rsquo;m leaving it off. It&rsquo;s just too jarring and unfamiliar. Instead, I&rsquo;m catching up on Seasons 1 and 2 of <em>Breaking Bad</em>.</li>
<li>Half-way done with teaching now. Two more days of class, one day of meetings, and then I go home. Can&rsquo;t wait.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in Hyderabad, India this week for work. (I&rsquo;ll be teaching a training class all week for the employees of our Indian office.) Rather than post this as a series of tweets that nobody is going to read because I&rsquo;m 12 hours ahead of them, I&rsquo;ll scatter my thoughts on the blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I left Cedar Rapids at 1pm Iowa time on Friday afternoon. From there I went through Detroit and Amsterdam to get to Mumbai. Overnighted in Mumbai, then caught an early flight to Hyderabad. Got to the hotel about 10:00 AM India time on Sunday, which is about midnight Saturday night/Sunday morning back home. 36 hours of travel. Oof. Business class is great, but it doesn&rsquo;t make the flights any shorter.</p>
<p>OK, I just threw away 200 words of travel narrative because I was getting tired of it, and if I was, all of you will. Instead I&rsquo;m gonna do bullet points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a hotel car pick you up from the airport is the way to go. Indian road markings, signs, and signals are suggestions as best. Traffic negotiation appears to be done primarily with horns and flashing headlights.</li>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t see much of Mumbai - arrived and left when it was still dark - but the airport was gloomy and damp. As was the hotel.</li>
<li>The difference between Mumbai and Hyderabad was stark. The Hyderabad airport is a lot newer and more modern, and it&rsquo;s clear that Hyderabad has put in, and continues to put in significant effort into modernizing. It appears that they want to be known as the tech-friendly, environmentally-conscious city.</li>
<li>There were people out along the major freeway in Hyderabad this morning planting hundreds of little trees to line the roadway. Which also meant lots of little piles of dirt in the right-hand lane and people standing in the road shoveling.</li>
<li>The sheer number of people everywhere is overwhelming. Even at the hotel, in each public area they have a bazillion employees there to offer you assistance with every little thing. (A guy had to come out and spread a pool towel on the deck chair for me before I could sit down on it. I mean, come on.) For an introvert like me who likes to just figure things out on my own and be left alone, it&rsquo;s exhausting.</li>
<li>On that point, why doesn&rsquo;t the hotel here have a comprehensive information book in the room? In the states, we&rsquo;d have a book that gave all the details for the hotel, when the restaurants were open, amenities, etc. Here apparently I have to <em>ask</em> somebody. (See preceding point.) Once again: exhausting.</li>
<li>After 48 hours of travel, I&rsquo;ve gained an entire extra level of appreciation for Bill Murray&rsquo;s world-weary role in Lost in Translation. What time/day is it again, anyway?</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s days one and two of my India trip. I&rsquo;ve got 45 minutes more to wait before the hotel restaurant opens and I can get some dinner to try to help reset my body clock. Then it&rsquo;s off to dreamland, and the first of four full days of teaching classes tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Twitter was abuzz with #Hutchmoot tags yesterday after Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s announcement of the special guest for this year&rsquo;s Nashville faith and arts conference: singer/songwriter Rich Mullins. Mullins, 57, had big Christian music hits in the 1990&rsquo;s with &ldquo;Awesome God&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sometimes By Step&rdquo;, has been nearly unheard from since the release of &ldquo;The Jesus Record&rdquo; in 1997.</p>
<p>Mullins has spent most of the last decade on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico, continuing to teach music lessons to children and reportedly working on a memoir. It&rsquo;s not immediately clear what prompted Mullins' desire to jump back into the music world by attending Hutchmoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was stunned to get the phone call&rdquo;, said Hutchmoot organizer Andrew Peterson. &ldquo;Rich has been an inspiration to me for decades. Rich&rsquo;s music is the common fabric that inspired so many of us who write at The Rabbit Room and who record as the Square Peg Alliance. It&rsquo;s a great honor to have him join us and share at Hutchmoot this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adding to the Hutchmoot buzz was a tweet from long-time Mullins producer Reed Arvin (@reedarvin) who said yesterday &ldquo;Exciting phonecall from an old friend. Can&rsquo;t produce this time but he couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better producer.&rdquo; This was followed, ten minutes later, by a single-word tweet from Andrew Peterson collaborator, pianist and producer Ben Shive (@benshive): &ldquo;Speechless&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tickets for this year&rsquo;s Hutchmoot have long been sold out, but Rabbit Room proprietor Pete Peterson notes that he is keeping a waiting list if there are any last-minute cancellations.</p>
<p>-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p><em>Rich Mullins passed away as the result of a car accident 15 years ago today. Those of us who grew up loving Rich&rsquo;s music are forever in his debt. We miss you, Rich. Rest in peace awaiting the resurrection.</em></p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a little over a month since <a href="/12/08/standing-up-at-my-desk/">I began using a standing desk at work</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So how&rsquo;s it going after a month? Pretty well, actually. Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>My back, arms, and shoulders are a lot less sore at the end of each day. I&rsquo;m tall (6-4) and squishing myself under a desk all day just wasn&rsquo;t good form. Standing up is a lot better.</li>
<li>My legs are slowly getting used to it. The first day I stood up all day I was <em>definitely</em> ready to get off my feet at the end of the day.</li>
<li>I got a standing mat that helped a lot. Having 3/4-inch of foam between my feet and the floor really helps.</li>
<li>I learned really quick which shoes are comfortable (my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SOLLFG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005SOLLFG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">Merrell Road Gloves</a> are <em>awesome</em>) and which ones are not (my cheap black dress shoes).</li>
<li>My co-workers were amused, interested, and curious. I don&rsquo;t know that any of them will take up the trend, but many of them observed that it might be a nice change. (It&rsquo;s also possible they were just being polite and really think that I&rsquo;m a weirdo.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on sticking with the standing desk for the time being. If I&rsquo;m still gung-ho about it after, say, Christmas, I might start pursuing the possibility of getting a real standing desk via the regular work channels. I understand they have one that is electric and adjustable, which would be nice. It&rsquo;d also be nice to bring all of my work surface (not just my monitors and keyboard) up to standing level.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/09/03/andrew-peterson-light.html">Andrew Peterson - Light for the Lost Boy</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/09/03/andrew-peterson-light.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-09-03 19:58:18 -0500">Sep 3, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a>&rsquo;s new record, <em>Light for the Lost Boy</em>, came out last week, but a business trip and a busy weekend conspired against me. So, my first listen to the record didn&rsquo;t come until this morning. There is so much I could say about this record that I don&rsquo;t even really know where to begin.</p>
<p>Great records seem to come out of pain. Much as I love Peterson&rsquo;s earlier records, they&rsquo;ve succeeded due to their beautiful melodies and tightly-crafted lyrics. The truth is present in his word-art, but it hasn&rsquo;t as often fully resonated with the deep soul ache of a man wrestling with the fallenness of the world and the goodness of God.</p>
<p><em>Light for the Lost Boy</em>, though, changes all that. From the opening line of the record (&ldquo;I remember the day of the Tennessee flood&hellip;&quot;), Peterson examines the fallen beauty of the world, the joy of childhood, and the loss of innocence that comes as we grow up. (I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/2012/08/album-release-light-for-the-lost-boy/">Jonathan Rogers' piece on this record over on The Rabbit Room</a>. Jonathan says it way better than I can.)</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Cornerstone&rdquo;, he examines the experience of colliding with Jesus in a life-changing way. &ldquo;The Voice of Jesus&rdquo; sits in contrast as a lullaby to a child, recognizing how God speaks to her through &ldquo;the ache in your bones&rdquo;. The final track, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t You Want to Thank Someone?&rdquo; is epic in length (9 minutes 57 seconds!) and in scope, tracing the course of human history from the goodness of creation through the fall and finally to the ultimate reckoning.</p>
<p>Sonically this record breaks some new ground for Peterson. While some tracks (including the official pre-release, &ldquo;Rest Easy&rdquo;) will sound familiar to the ears of long-time Peterson fans, at least half of the record builds energy with electric guitars and electronic beats. While the record was produced by Ben Shive and Cason Cooley, the opening track had me thinking that my friend Andy Osenga had a hand in it. (The song &ldquo;Carry the Fire&rdquo; is AP&rsquo;s nearly exact corollary to Andy O&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hold The Light&rdquo;. This is a good thing.)</p>
<p>If it isn&rsquo;t clear enough from my review already, <em>Light for the Lost Boy</em> is highly, highly recommended. It would be presumptuous of me to declare it my new favorite Andrew Peterson record after only one listen. However, given that after one listen I can remember every song and a particular way that it stuck with me, I think that future listens (of which there will be <em>many</em>) will only cement this record as a long-time favorite from Peterson.</p>
<p>You can buy the record from <a href="https://store.rabbitroom.com/product/light-for-the-lost-boy">The Rabbit Room</a>, or on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/light-for-the-lost-boy/id550675056?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">iTunes</a>.</p>

			 <p>I was stuck in a hotel last night watching Paul Ryan&rsquo;s speech, and after he ripped on Obamacare, I had to comment on twitter:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/241001677522604033">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Fellow BHT patron (and, so far as I can tell, staunch conservative / libertarian) Randy replied this morning. <a href="https://twitter.com/rmcrob/status/241113167256768512">twitter.com/rmcrob/st&hellip;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/241115651207483393">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/rmcrob/status/241115919592591360">twitter.com/rmcrob/st&hellip;</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/241118648847179777">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p>So, stuck in another hotel room tonight (headed home tomorrow, thank God), as promised I want to write down some thoughts about single payer health care.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll lay out my disclaimers out front: I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of research on this. I&rsquo;m shooting more or less from the hip. I&rsquo;m not a doctor, nor do I have experience with the medical industry, save as an infrequent consumer.</p>
<p><strong>So, about single payer&hellip;</strong> Maybe I should be a good engineer and first define what I mean by &ldquo;single payer&rdquo; health care. I use the term to describe a system where the government provides the funding for the health care system in the country, paying for services directly. Examples of single payer systems include the British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service">National Health Service</a>, and, to an extent, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Canada">Canadian health care system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why might single payer be a good idea?</strong></p>
<p><em>Lower costs</em> It&rsquo;s a fair question: do we really think government is the most efficient way to run things? But let&rsquo;s face it: the current system isn&rsquo;t efficient. Administrative costs eat anywhere between 10 percent (if you believe the insurance agencies) and 30 percent (per a Harvard Medical School report) of the total health care dollars in the US. With $2.26 <em>trillion</em> dollars spent each year in the US on health care, percentage gains for administrative overhead will equal savings. Think about the number of insurance companies and billing middle-men that can be avoided in a single payer system.</p>
<p><em>Better understanding of actual costs</em></p>
<p>Any time I look at a bill received from the doctor I realize there are a bunch of shenanigans going on with the pricing of health care. The &ldquo;list price&rdquo; for a procedure (i.e. the price I would pay if I didn&rsquo;t have insurance?) is <em>really</em> high. But then there&rsquo;s this &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; price listed. Which is a lot less. And I only have to pay a percentage of the &ldquo;negotiated&rdquo; price. It&rsquo;s bizarre and hard to explain.</p>
<p><em>It works other places</em></p>
<p>Republicans will tell you anecdotal horror stories about the British or Canadian health care systems, but in the less-biased opinions of my British and Canadian friends, those systems actually work decently well. They&rsquo;re not perfect, but they&rsquo;re not atrocious, either. It&rsquo;s doable.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s different than housing and transportation</em></p>
<p>Randy asked why, if we&rsquo;re going to go the public funding route, don&rsquo;t we also publicly fund other needs, like housing and transportation?</p>
<p>First off: we often do. It&rsquo;s called public housing assistance, and public transportation.</p>
<p>Second off: health care is a different sort of beast. Lack of basic health care can be the reason that poor people are physically <em>unable</em> to work a job. A preventable dental condition or disease can be the difference between being able to show up to work and having to stay home.</p>
<p><em>The Social Contract</em></p>
<p>Whether you fully buy in to Thomas Hobbes' idea of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract">Social Contract</a> or not, I think he got at least one thing right: that there are certain ills which the government is the appropriate remedy, and that citizens should agree to give up some freedoms to that government in return for the benefits it provides.</p>
<p>Heck, even the Apostle Paul (Romans 13) notes that God designed government to &ldquo;wield the sword&rdquo;, so it seems that God isn&rsquo;t completely opposed to governments.</p>
<p>Reading the Old Testament (and the New), it&rsquo;s also clear that God places priority on caring for the poor, and in treating all classes and races of people with justice and mercy. The Marilynne Robinson essays I read a couple weeks back spoke strongly on that topic, noting that the OT law is designed in multiple aspects to protect the poor and the week, by outlawing usury, time-limiting slavery, and forgiving debts in the jubilee year.</p>
<p>As the people of God, I believe we should value justice and mercy more than personal freedom and rights. Perhaps our Christianity has been tied to our politics for so long in the USA that we&rsquo;ve forgotten that the church has flourished over the years under many different political theories and types of government. America&rsquo;s version of democracy may have attractive features, but it&rsquo;s not God&rsquo;s only righteous design for governments.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn&rsquo;t the church do it?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been down this discussion path enough times before that I know the next objection that gets raised: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the church&rsquo;s responsibility to care for the poor, not the government&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I say great, if the church can fund it, let&rsquo;s go for it. But if you look at the money that each church would need to raise in order to start covering things like welfare and health care, you&rsquo;d quickly exhaust the coffers of every congregation in the country. The church simply does not exist as a significant enough percentage of the population for this to be feasible.</p>
<p>Yes, the church should give funds to care for the poor when they can. (And probably more than most of them currently do.) But it&rsquo;s not a logical jump to assert that the church is the <em>only</em> group that should do it.</p>
<p><strong>OK, that&rsquo;s a lot of words already&hellip; get to the point!</strong></p>
<p>When I boil it down, I conclude that if a society values justice and mercy toward all, ensuring provision for basic health care is a necessity. If I have to choose between the current unjust mess that we&rsquo;ve got, and a system that, while run by the government, provides care for all, I&rsquo;ll support the government-run plan.</p>
<p>For an equally-lengthy, but much-better-put piece on this topic, I&rsquo;d encourage you to read <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/euangelion/2012/06/evangelicals-and-health-care-long-blog-post/">Michael Bird&rsquo;s piece from back in June over on Patheos</a>.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/08/29/three-careers-i.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-08-29 20:49:42 -0500">Aug 29, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m sitting in a hotel room in Florida tonight, bored and needing blogging inspiration. So I hit up twitter. Two minutes later my buddy Geof primes the pump: <a href="http://twitter.com/gfmorris/status/240979495488716801">twitter.com/gfmorris/&hellip;</a></p>
<p>So, three careers I could&rsquo;ve pursued, but didn&rsquo;t. Here&rsquo;s your chance to get to know a little more about me.</p>
<p><strong>Career option #1: musician</strong></p>
<p>My first love has always been music. I&rsquo;ve played the piano since I was in second grade, play guitar and bass, love classical, jazz, rock, and most stuff in between. One of my greatest joys is playing with a talented group of musicians. There&rsquo;s an amazing convergence of mental pleasure in playing some piece of music as a part of a group - everybody contributing their own part to make the whole - and an emotional rush from the beauty of the music itself.</p>
<p>[caption width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johannabocher/5856191649/" title="Arcade Fire by Johanna Bocher, on Flickr"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b8b2a2e375.jpg" alt="Arcade Fire"></a> Could I have been this guy? Nah, I could never pull off that haircut.[/caption]</p>
<p>I considered some music options while I was in high school, but never really committed to the idea. I suppose I never really had a good idea about what the heck I would&rsquo;ve done with it. My dad had been a high school music teacher, but his recommendation was to do something else - something that would be easier to provide for myself and a family. I don&rsquo;t resent his advice at all or regret heeding it - I&rsquo;ve got no complaints about where I am now - but sometimes I wonder what alternate path could&rsquo;ve occurred if instead of going to LeTourneau I&rsquo;d gone to Belmont to do something music related. I would&rsquo;ve been there about the time Andy Osenga and Cason Cooley were deciding to quit school to do this band called The Normals, and when Ben Shive was skipping finals to write string arrangements for Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s Christmas album.</p>
<p><strong>Career Option #2: Pastoral ministry</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bookish, nerdy guy. I like theology. I like to study and wrestle with issues. There was a time in high school when I thought the pastorate was the way to go. Relevant advice I received from two different pastors over the years: &ldquo;if you can do something else, do it. Only be a pastor if you&rsquo;re so called to it that you can&rsquo;t do anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[caption width=&ldquo;328&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dvdmerwe/220042415/" title="Window at Parish Church of St Peter, Frampton Cotterell, England by DanieVDM, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/78/220042415_e5dbf98959.jpg" alt="Window at Parish Church of St Peter, Frampton Cotterell, England"></a> My church doesn&rsquo;t have stained glass. I kinda miss it.[/caption]</p>
<p>In retrospect, it&rsquo;s probably just as well I didn&rsquo;t go this route. Though I continue to love theology and exploring my faith, I&rsquo;m such an introvert that I think the personal aspects of pastoral ministry would completely wear me out. I enjoy the opportunities to be in church leadership in a role as a layman; making a career out of it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Career Option #3: OK, this one is a cheat.</strong></p>
<p>I never seriously considered this one as an option, but I&rsquo;ve idly thought about it as a path I would enjoy following in some alternate universe: I&rsquo;d like to be a professional baseball umpire.</p>
<p>[caption width=&ldquo;500&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tunnelarmr/1355531075/" title="Umpire by tunnelarmr, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1296/1355531075_da89c6836d.jpg" alt="Umpire"></a> Time to get in the zone.[/caption]</p>
<p>I love the game, have a keen enough mind that I might be able to absorb the intricacies of the rulebook, and might just be able to hold my own in making the judgment calls. I might be a little bit tall to be an umpire - most MLB umpires are under 6 feet, making it easier to squat down to call balls and strikes - but maybe I could make it work. I hear the minor league circuit is pretty brutal on umps, though, so it&rsquo;s not as if it&rsquo;s a particularly glamorous job, and there aren&rsquo;t a lot of openings at the top level. Still&hellip; it&rsquo;d be fun.</p>
<p>So thanks, Geof, for the topic. I&rsquo;ll go peruse twitter now and see if there are any other good ideas floating around there.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a lot of wanna-be stages in my life as a musician. My mother listened with horror while as a teenager I tried to imitate Michael W. Smith&rsquo;s raspy pop voice. Then I fell in love with Rich Mullins and worked out all of his piano riffs. I&rsquo;ve dreamed about playing electric guitar with U2 (I know, they already have a guy), saxophone in Harry Connick&rsquo;s band, and replacing another guy named Chris who fronts for Coldplay.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve finally settled on a wanna-be now, though. I just wanna be Andy Gullahorn.</p>
<p>You may not be familiar with Andy, so let me introduce you.</p>
<p>Andy Gullahorn is a tall, quiet, guitar-playing Texan who writes songs and plays guitars for lots of folks. I&rsquo;ve most often seen him on stage adding a second guitar for Andrew Peterson.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Andy is a man of few words. Seemingly every time he takes the mic to sing he stares awkwardly at the crowd, finally saying simply &ldquo;hello&rdquo;, and then launching in to a song. His songs are clever, insightful, and funny. He has you laughing right up until the point where you feel the blade twist and realize he&rsquo;s got you good. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ8UJ-EtddM">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>
<p>Andy has <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">a website</a> which he recently updated. Part of me is glad he updated it, because it looks really nice and might help impress people who don&rsquo;t know him. The other part of me is sad, because his old website was this mess of homebrewed awesomeness that captured Andy&rsquo;s <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. At least his new site still has some of his <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com/category/haiku-reviews/">haiku reviews</a>, which are fantastic.</p>
<p>(A recent haiku, just as an example: &ldquo;Summer night plus woods / Plus Kentucky plus stage lights / Equals moths in face&rdquo;. Boom.)</p>
<p>When I was in Nashville back in May to hear NT Wright, a bunch of the Square Peg types sang songs before the good bishop spoke. And darn near every song, there was Andy in the background, playing the second guitar part, adding just the right amount of background vocal. After every song he&rsquo;d back off, sit down, only to hear the next song that was being played and jump right back in.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s gets me most about Andy:</strong> he&rsquo;s not a star. He&rsquo;s the consummate backup man. He knows everybody&rsquo;s songs, the right keys to play them in, the guitar riffs, and all the harmonies.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t necessarily recognize that Andy&rsquo;s there, but you sure as heck would notice if he was missing. He adds the complementary touch that makes each song better but he never hogs the spotlight. When the spotlight is thrust upon him, he speaks truth in a way that sneaks up on you.</p>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s the guy I want to be.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday on Twitter I had a bit of a conversation with some friends about the relationship of our churches and the related need for community. (<a href="https://twitter.com/rmcrob">Randy</a> <a href="http://storify.com/rmcrob/launching-a-church">archived the conversation on Storify</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.) In the midst of a discussion about a church &ldquo;launching&rdquo;, this exchange occurred:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kinnon/status/237580584162050048">twitter.com/kinnon/st&hellip;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/237581255573643266">twitter.com/cjhubbs/s&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Afterward, another friend, Jason Blair, mused that this is <a href="http://www.arsgratia.com/?p=428">doing things all backwards</a>.</p>
<p>This is one of those things that in my heart I sense is true, but I&rsquo;ve not got the faintest idea how it would work out in reality. Let&rsquo;s imagine, though.</p>
<p><strong>The way it could be</strong></p>
<p>Imagine if we had a small group of families who were bought into the idea of wanting to do community first, and then see how it worked out in practice. And imagine if we took all the time that right now is filled up with church programs, and instead we just existed in community together.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning men&rsquo;s bible study could still be Tuesday morning bible study, but would be even better focused because it would be between men who were developing real relationships through the week.</p>
<p>Wednesday night dinner and clubs at church could instead be Wednesday night dinner and hang out at somebody&rsquo;s house. Kids could play, parents could talk. Relationships would grow.</p>
<p>Saturday morning music practice could give way to a chance for dads to hang out with the kids and give the moms a chance to have brunch and time out, or to have a bunch of families get together to work on some project, whether that be to serve one of the families in the group or to serve someplace else in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Sunday morning could still be a worship gathering, but with less emphasis on programs.</p>
<p>At the end of a year or two of this, you would develop significant relationships that would last a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>So why don&rsquo;t we do this?</strong></p>
<p>I know, I know. If it&rsquo;s so great, why aren&rsquo;t we doing it already? After all, it&rsquo;s easy to dream about it on a blog, but in the end I&rsquo;m still a member of a 400-member church. Why am I such a hypocrite? (Or, to frame it in a way that hurts less: why is this so hard?)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inertia.</strong> There are significant comfortable aspects to where we are now. We have friends here. Our kids like the programs. It&rsquo;s easy to just tell people what church you go to rather than explaining something different. Change is hard.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Different&rdquo; is scary.</strong> What does this look like initially, especially on Sunday mornings? Are we attending somewhere? Not attending anywhere? What will our friends and family have to say about it? Do we have vestigial legalism that is telling us we need to be at some church building every Sunday morning?</li>
<li><strong>How do we find like-minded people?</strong> I know where I can find one. Problem is, Jason is in the Twin Cities. How do I find such folks in my own city? (If you&rsquo;re one of them, leave a comment or send me an email or something!)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the midst of all of this, there&rsquo;s another nagging question in the back of my head: <em>how does this kind of community-first focus fit with what the church has historically done over the past 2000 years?</em> Is it closer to the ages-long norm than what we&rsquo;re doing today?</p>
<p>I clearly still have more questions here than answers, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Jason has it right: doing &ldquo;church&rdquo; first, and then fighting like crazy to try to build community sure seems backwards.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the online discussion about standing desks for a while now. Heck, it&rsquo;s clear enough to anybody willing to think about it that just sitting, all day, every day, can&rsquo;t be good for you. Add to it that I&rsquo;m 6-foot-4 (that&rsquo;s 193 cm for my two Canadian readers) and it&rsquo;s not so easy to cram my legs underneath the desk, and I end up needing to unkink myself every hour or so during the day. Even doing that I still end up with achy legs, a sore elbow from leaning on it too much, and a sore back.</p>
<p>(To be fair, the sore back could be more due to the slouching I do in bed at night reading and watching tv. And the fact that I&rsquo;m not getting any younger. 35 still feels like it&rsquo;s on the happy end of my 30&rsquo;s. Next year ain&rsquo;t gonna feel that way.)</p>
<p>There are some ridiculous cool standing desk assemblies out there, at ridiculously uncool prices. Not in this guy&rsquo;s budget. Now, I work for $MEGACORP, so there&rsquo;s probably some bureaucratic process I could go through to make the request for a standing desk, and some ergonomic person would eventually sign off on it, and 6 weeks from now I might have something. But I really wanted to try the idea out sooner. Here&rsquo;s what I ended up with (click on it to see the full-sized pic):</p>
<p><img src="/images/2012/standing-desk.jpg" alt="standing desk"></p>
<p>I ended up spending just shy of $20 at Lowe&rsquo;s for a nice piece of coated shelf board for my table tops, and then a chunk of 1x8 for the legs. My monitors now sit 20&quot; above my desk, and my keyboard/mouse about 15&quot;. I&rsquo;m about 3 hours into using it so far, and so far so good. We&rsquo;ll see how sore my feet and legs are tomorrow. I&rsquo;m actually sort of easing into it, since my all-afternoon meeting today and tomorrow means I&rsquo;ll only be standing for half-days.</p>
<p>I figure if I decide I like it, later on I can make the ergonomic request and see about a &ldquo;real&rdquo; standing desk. For now, though, this&rsquo;ll do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where, unless I&rsquo;m looking for a specific book, I don&rsquo;t even visit the main stacks of the library any more. Instead, I head right for the &ldquo;new books&rdquo; section, and pick up a recent novel or biography.</p>
<p>While perusing the new book shelf during my last visit, I picked up Marilynne Robinson&rsquo;s book of essays on a whim. It&rsquo;s not the type of book I usually pick up, but it looked interesting enough, and short enough that I had a chance to get through it without getting majorly bogged down.</p>
<p>Marilynne Robinson teaches at the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the U of I. She&rsquo;s probably best known for her novel <em>Gilead</em>, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 2005. It ends up, though, that she&rsquo;s published more essays than she has novels, and, if her latest volume is any indication, her essays are really good.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374298785/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374298785&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20">When I Was A Child I Read Books</a></em> is a short, dense collection of essays that perhaps have less to do with reading books, and more to do with the intersection of faith and the current American religious culture. Robinson stakes out a middle ground that on one hand rejects the liberal theology of mainstream Christian denominations, while simultaneously opposing the apparent hard, uncaring line heard too often from the far right wing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have felt for a long time that our idea of what a human being is has grown oppressively small and dull.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robinson&rsquo;s essays call us to accept and embrace the mystery and beauty of being human. She urges us to give others the benefit of the doubt, to live with compassion towards even (especially?) those who we don&rsquo;t know or understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is at present a dearth of humane imagination for the integrity and mystery of other lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>When I Was A Child I Read Books</em> was slow going, but only because there was such richness to savor on every page. If you have the time for some thoughtful reading, I&rsquo;d recommend this book.</p>

			 <p>So the same day I published my previous post on ditching my Android, a customer service guy from US Cellular named Tom pinged me on Twitter and asked for my email address so he could respond. I sent it to him, and he responded with a 1000-word treatise trying to address some of my points.</p>
<p>Highlights from his side of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Android OS Updates</strong> Samsung actually stopped releasing software updates for all 1st generation Samsung Galaxy S devices. Samsung made the decision that this line of devices would not get an official Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x or Jelly Bean 4.1x update. &hellip; This is much like Apple no longer supporting older hardware be it OSX Lion on an older Macbook or IOS 6 on an older iphone. As the software requirements are greater, older technology is rendered obsolete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so it&rsquo;s not US Cellular&rsquo;s fault, or Google&rsquo;s fault - it&rsquo;s Samsung&rsquo;s fault. Still, his comparison to Apple/iPhone is misguided. As I pointed out in my original post, if I&rsquo;d bought even the older iPhone (3GS) available back in December 2010, it would still be able to pick up the IOS 6 upgrade later this year. Advantage: iPhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Backup</strong><br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Backing up an Android device is a different story. If you are looking for ways to back up specific application data, then there isn&rsquo;t much I have found out there to do this&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, he notes that you can use Google to keep your calendar, contacts, and mail in sync w/ your Google account. But still, otherwise, he concedes the point. Android&rsquo;s backup solutions all suck, and to do a full apps/settings backup requires you to root your phone and void the warranty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>System Stability</strong> This is something that has only been getting better with newer hardware and software. My Galaxy S II for example has never had any issues with freezing up. My wife has the Mesmerize and from time to time will have issues with certain applications causing her phone to freeze. The Galaxy S III is in a ballpark all of its own. The hardware and software is much more advanced then even the Galaxy S II&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point it feels like he&rsquo;s starting to quote from the promotional literature. In short: yeah, your current phone (which we sold you as top-of-the-line 20 months ago) sucks, but trust us, it&rsquo;s getting better. <em>Oh wow, I feel so much better with that reassurance! Or not.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Phone/Signal/Software issues you’ve had.</strong> It&rsquo;s clear you have had issues with your phone. I do not doubt that at all. How much of this has been caused by rooting and putting different roms on the phone is unknown and can be debatable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha, I knew it&rsquo;d come back to this. When it comes down to brass tacks, I&rsquo;ll get blamed for rooting it. But I digress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the back button issue before. This can be caused by many things, from internal cracks in the digitizer, software related issues, internal hardware malfunctions, or even a screen protector not being put on the phone correctly. Your statement about it only happening in low-signal situations is the first I&rsquo;ve heard this and will definitely be looking at that more closely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, great. He&rsquo;ll look at it more closely. That helps me a lot.</p>
<p>I emailed him back with a short rebuttal, thanking him for his time. Yeah, US Cellular has been great customer service-wise. But I only use Customer Service maybe once a year. I use my phone every day. If I have to pick between one or the other, I&rsquo;ll go with the phone.</p>
<p>I sent one last email to Tom at the end of last week, with my final summary, and an offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I appreciate your desire to keep me as a customer, but at this point I don&rsquo;t have the time/inclination to continue a debate on the merits of Android/iPhone. I&rsquo;m sure that Samsung has improved things significantly now with the Galaxy S3; however, I&rsquo;m not willing right now to spend $300, mess around with a rebate, and commit to another 2 years of service to take a chance on the new Android after my previous experience, especially when I know my alternative (once my contract runs out in December) is to purchase a phone that has uniformly brilliant reviews from friends and family members.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If US Cellular wanted to provide me with an S3 at a much-reduced price, and without requiring me to re-up my contract, I&rsquo;d be happy to give it a fair evaluation, a review on my blog, and return it if I still decide that I want an iPhone. (I&rsquo;m not expecting that from USCC, but that&rsquo;s about what it&rsquo;d take at this point to get me to consider the S3.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this point, I haven&rsquo;t heard back from Tom. I don&rsquo;t really expect them to take me up on my offer.</p>
<p>The new iPhone can&rsquo;t come soon enough.</p>

			 <p>19 months ago I purchased my first smartphone - well, two of them, one for me and one for my wife. At the time, I already owned two iPod Touches and liked them a lot. However, the service package cost on a carrier that had an iPhone (Verizon or AT&amp;T at the time) was significantly higher than what I could get on US Cellular. So, with boundless optimism in my heart, I marched into the US Cellular store and bought a Samsung Mesmerize (aka Samsung Galaxy S). I paid $199 for each phone, along with a 2-year contract.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>19 months later I am counting down the days until my contract is up and I can switch to an iPhone. I was amused the other day when US Cellular&rsquo;s twitter folks pinged me on the topic. It&rsquo;s clear at least that the US Cellular party line is &ldquo;the new Android phones are awesome, forget about that iPhone thing&rdquo;. And gotta love their optimism: &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let your experience with the Mesmerize scare you off&rdquo;. Really? Why not? I spent a bunch of money 19 months ago to buy your top-of-the-line phone, and it&rsquo;s turned out to be craptastic at best. Why should I <strong>not</strong> be scared off?</p>
<p>So, in the spirit of a Shawn Blanc or John Siracusa review, here are the reasons I&rsquo;m dropping my Android phone like a hot potato and moving to the iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start from the ground floor and work our way up. I&rsquo;ve actually had less frustrations with the hardware than with the other parts of the device. The build quality is decent, even with a plastic back the phone feels like it&rsquo;s high quality (though not up to Apple standards). The camera is middling at best, but sufficient.</p>
<p>My main beef with the hardware, though, is a nasty design flaw that causes the Back button to trigger in low-signal situations. So when I&rsquo;m in a building where the cell signal is low, all of a sudden my phone goes crazy. I can&rsquo;t keep an app open for long, because some sort of internal interference is triggering the back key. It&rsquo;s apparently <a href="http://rootzwiki.com/topic/2088-fascinate-menu-and-back-buttons-going-haywire/">a known problem with the Galaxy S</a>, but completely unacceptable as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. The phone needs to just work, and in low signal conditions, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Operating System</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have too many beefs with the Android OS by itself - in fact, if I got a new device with ICS or Jelly Bean on it, I&rsquo;d probably like it a lot. But because the OS is customized for each device and for each carrier, it takes forever to get a new version of the OS for my phone once it&rsquo;s released, and then US Cellular started dropping support.</p>
<p>When I bought the phone in December 2010 it was running Android OS 2.2 (aka Froyo). 2.3 (Gingerbread) came out in December 2010 but wasn&rsquo;t available for my phone until April 2011. Come on, folks, Honeycomb (3.0) was already out by then. And that&rsquo;s the last update that US Cellular is supporting on the Galaxy S. No Honeycomb. No Ice Cream Sandwich. Certainly no Jelly Bean. So <strong>my operating system has been at least one version behind Android&rsquo;s releases the entire time I&rsquo;ve owned it</strong>, and is now three versions behind.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">Android&rsquo;s full version history on Wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<p>By comparison, if I&rsquo;d bought the current iPhone at the time (the iPhone 4, or, heck, even the lower-tier iPhone 3GS), I would&rsquo;ve had immediate download/upgrade of each new iOS release when it happened, including the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/">upcoming iOS 6</a>. Given that the big stability and feature advances come in the operating systems, always being behind is just unacceptable.</p>
<p>Now yeah, there are custom ROMs. I tried a bunch of them. Their stability was always tenuous at best, and complete crap at worst. In the end, I went back to using the stock US Cellular-provided ROM, though I did then root it. More about that later.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>I have two main gripes with the Android ecosystem - media management and backup. I&rsquo;ll address both.</p>
<p><strong>Media Management</strong> is an issue because it&rsquo;s a pain in the rear to get music and photos on and off the phone. Sure, there are a few programs designed to help automate that, but they&rsquo;re mostly a pain in the rear and don&rsquo;t work well. Now, iTunes is still a flaming pile of poo when it comes to managing content on devices, but it&rsquo;s still a far cry better than anything that works decently with Android.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t even get me started about <strong>backups</strong>. The only way to fully backup the Android phone, apps, settings, texts, etc, is to root the phone and then buy a third-party backup program. And rooting the phone automatically voids your warranty. Let me say that again so it&rsquo;s clear. <strong>The only way to fully backup your phone is to first void the warranty.</strong> Does that seem insane to anyone else but me?</p>
<p>US Cellular actually realized how much of a nightmare this situation is, or at least would be for them if angry customers suddenly realized their phones had crashed and they&rsquo;d lost all of their contacts. So, they wrote some craptastic software &ldquo;My Contacts Backup&rdquo; that gets bundled with your phone and will backup your contacts to some unknown server somewhere. If you run it. Manually.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2012/contacts-backup.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p>Application support for the Android has actually improved as time has gone on - more and more of the apps I liked on the iPhone have migrated over to Android, albeit in editions that were typically uglier, missing features, and running more unreliably than their iOS counterparts. I&rsquo;m getting to the point now, though, where new apps that come out won&rsquo;t run on the phone because I need a newer version of the OS. After only 19 months, my device is going obsolete. Grrrr.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2012/app-incompatible.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>System Stability</strong></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether to blame this one on the hardware, the OS, the applications, or some combination of all three, but for most of the time I&rsquo;ve had it, my phone has locked up to where I had to do the three-button reboot at least once <em>per day</em>. Yep, once per day.</p>
<p>And it never locks up at a good time. Because either it locks up while it&rsquo;s in my pocket, with the backlight on full brightness, and it sits in my pocket for who knows how long w/o receiving calls or texts, and running down the battery, <em>or</em> it locks up right when I&rsquo;m trying to open an app, or take a call, or send a text - i.e. when I need to use it.</p>
<p>Earlier this spring it locked up unbeknownst to me while my wife had taken my daughter to the emergency room. I took it out of my pocket and realized it&rsquo;d been locked up solid for 20 minutes (the clock display stops updating, so it&rsquo;s easy to tell how long it&rsquo;s been frozen). If my wife had needed to get ahold of me in that time, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to, and I would&rsquo;ve never known until it was too late. Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Earlier this week I was out shopping when my wife texted me to pick up something else at the store. I tried to send her a return text, and it appeared that it wouldn&rsquo;t send the text. So I tried going into and out of airplane mode, to see if that&rsquo;d reset the radio and send the text. No such luck. Then I tried gracefully rebooting the phone to see if that&rsquo;d fix it. Still no dice. Then I crash rebooted it. Finally it did send the text. Actually, it sent my first text about half a dozen times. I finally gave up and just called her.</p>
<p>Oh, but that crash reboot - it completely hosed up my alarm clock app. I tried just deleting the data and cache for the app, but that didn&rsquo;t fix it. Finally I had to uninstall the app, reboot, clear my phone&rsquo;s cache, then reinstall the app to finally get it working. And then set up all my alarm settings again.</p>
<p><strong>So what does it do well?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what this phone does well: if I just want to use it as the Android equivalent of a 3G-enabled iPod Touch, I&rsquo;m OK with it. I can check Twitter, run my weather and news apps, keep a calendar and some contacts on it, do some Facebook and a little Instagram, and it works tolerably. Especially on wifi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when you get to these edge cases like, oh, I don&rsquo;t know, <em>making a phone call</em> that it seems to totally go to crap.</p>
<p><strong>So, I&rsquo;m gonna switch.</strong></p>
<p>Now, if the nice customer service person from US Cellular wants to explain to me again why I shouldn&rsquo;t let this experience &ldquo;scare me off&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d be entertained to hear about it. I&rsquo;ll kinda hate to leave US Cellular - their customer service has been pretty good and their package prices are reasonable - but at this point I&rsquo;m much more interested in having a device that works, even if it means I have to pay a little more for it. If my experience with my other Apple devices (two iTouches, an iPad, a Mac Mini, and an iMac) are any indication, and if my family and friends' reports are to be trusted, I&rsquo;ll be much happier with the iPhone.</p>

			 <p>We were at Chick-fil-A a couple of weeks ago for Cow Appreciation day when we ran into some friends we hadn&rsquo;t seen in a while. Well, friends might be a little strong - is there a term for people who you know you&rsquo;d love if you only had the time to get to know them better?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We met Aaron and Beth at least a decade ago through a mutual friend. He is a pastor, she the stay-at-home mom caring for five (now soon to be six!) kids. We enjoyed our visits - usually at the home of that mutual friend - and would run into each other at the occasional church softball game or local concert.</p>
<p>Each time we&rsquo;d run in to them and visit for a few minutes, I was impressed with how quickly the conversation gained substance. Beth and my wife could be talking for no more than 3 minutes and be deep into something about parenting or homeschooling or marriage, always in the vein of &ldquo;how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are you learning?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Four years ago I hit a crisis point in my church/ministry life and desperately needed some outside guidance. I had no idea who to talk to, since all of my contacts were at my church, and far too close to the situation I was dealing with. So my wife suggested I talk to Aaron.</p>
<p>The man had no responsibility to me - I didn&rsquo;t attend his church, didn&rsquo;t even know him that well - and yet he made time to sit down for lunch with me, listened to my story for 45 minutes, and offered some very wise counsel. After we left that church, we visited Aaron&rsquo;s church a few times, but ended up landing somewhere else. I still feel like I&rsquo;ve never thanked him properly for that bit of free-agent pastoral care that I so desperately needed.</p>
<p>When we met at Chick-Fil-A the other night the conversation was a little bit awkward. I had kids to keep track of, he was ready to get in line to order before the line got too long, so we tripped over the standard &ldquo;how&rsquo;s things?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Busy, but good&rdquo;, and &ldquo;wow, the kids are getting big&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think either of our hearts were in it, but the long time between visits and the short time available to talk kept us from breaking the boundary into truly meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>You hear people talk from time to time about who they want to talk to when they get to heaven. The musicians talk about getting to know King David. The rhetoriticians want to talk to the Apostle Paul. Kids want to talk to Noah to find out what it was like on the ark with all of those smelly animals. But I&rsquo;ve never really had anybody on that list. Fact is, I don&rsquo;t ask lots of questions - I tend to just observe and absorb when I&rsquo;m around people. I&rsquo;d get tongue-tied if I had to sit at Timothy&rsquo;s feet and ask what it was like to lead the early church. Even in the imaginative sense it seems like it&rsquo;d be really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that the life eternal will consist of us sitting around and getting to know our heroes - though I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we had that opportunity - but if it does, it&rsquo;ll take this musician a while to warm up to the idea of getting to know J. S. Bach or G. F. Handel or even my recent hero Richard Wayne Mullins. But hey, it&rsquo;s eternity, right? They can wait.</p>
<p>Sometime earlier in there, though, I&rsquo;d like to take a decade or two really getting to know Aaron and Beth.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t often stop to read obituaries any more - lack of a newspaper subscription puts a crimp in that - but there was one this past week that caught my eye, and quickly my attention: the British newspaper <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9365640/Count-Robert-de-La-Rochefoucauld.html">The Telegraph&rsquo;s obituary of Count Robert de La Rochefoucauld of France</a>. Here&rsquo;s the lede:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count Robert de La Rochefoucauld, who has died aged 88, escaped from Occupied France to join the Special Operations Executive (SOE); parachuted back on sabotage missions, he twice faced execution, only to escape on both occasions, once dressed as a Nazi guard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;620&rdquo;]<img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e12f6dab18.jpg" alt="" title="Robert de La Rouchefocauld">Count Robert de La Rochefoucauld, image from The Telegraph[/caption]</p>
<p>The Telegraph&rsquo;s account of his life adventures reads like an adventure novel. Raised in French aristocracy. As a boy he met Hitler. During WWII he joined the French resistance, then escaped to Britain and joined the British <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>. Parachuted behind enemy lines into France. Escaped captivity twice, once by faking an epileptic fit, killing the guard who came in to check on him, and then walking out of the prison wearing the dead guard&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Audacity&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t even really begin to capture the spirit of Count de La Rochefoucauld&rsquo;s life. Even as an old man it seems he continued this way. In 1997, when an old war ally was convicted of crimes related to deporting Jews during WWII - a conviction that de La Rochefoucauld believed to be in error - de La Rochefoucauld gave the friend his passport so he could escape to Switzerland.</p>
<p>When I read this obituary it immediately put me in mind of David&rsquo;s mighty men in 2 Samuel 23 - including Benaiah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2023:20-21&amp;version=NIV">2 Sam 23:20-21</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta admit - it&rsquo;s just particularly awesome to know that we live in a modern day where there are still people with the audacity and courage to perform feats like these when it becomes necessary. In the adventure of life, we can all take some inspiration from <em>l&rsquo;audace</em> of Robert de La Rochefoucauld.</p>

			 <p>Years ago when my family first got a VCR and started renting movies, my dad made a beeline for all of the Rocky and Bullwinkle titles he could find. And for good cause: they are full of the corny jokes and clever puns that my family&rsquo;s humor has revolved around for years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>(Today all the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle episodes are <a href="http://www.hulu.com/rocky-and-bullwinkle-and-friends">available to stream on Hulu</a>. But I digress.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bullwinkle:</strong> Twenty dollars?!? That&rsquo;s antihistamine money!
<strong>Rocky:</strong> Antihistamine money?
<strong>Bullwinkle:</strong> Yes. It&rsquo;s not to be sneezed at. Get it? Not to be sneezed at?
<strong>Rocky:</strong> I get it.
<strong>Bullwinkle:</strong> Thousands won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So there you go.</p>

			 <p><em>Sorry for turning this into a book review blog of sorts. One of these days I&rsquo;m going to get to some more serious posting. For now, though, I&rsquo;m going to get the books reviewed that I need to. Bear with me.</em></p>
<p>The subtitle of Rhett Smith&rsquo;s book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802404448/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802404448">The Anxious Christian</a></em> is either a very silly rhetorical question or designed to feed the anxieties of the target audience. &ldquo;Can God use your anxiety for good?&rdquo; Well, of course He can. God&rsquo;s ability in that regard has never really been in question. If you&rsquo;re one of Smith&rsquo;s anxious Christians, though, maybe your anxiety about God&rsquo;s ability will drive you to buy the book.</p>
<p>Smith uses the early chapters of the book to recount his own struggle with anxiety as a young man. The loss of his mother and several other close relatives at an early age drove him to compulsive behaviors in an attempt to bring some control to his anxious, insecure life. Smith then explores the lessons he has learned from seeing God&rsquo;s work in his life.</p>
<p>Christians who don&rsquo;t wrestle with anxiety on a regular basis may immediately point to Phillippians 4 where Paul instructs us to &ldquo;be anxious for nothing&rdquo;. Smith addresses this directly in the first chapter, saying that while the instruction is &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; and is often counseled by those who &ldquo;mean well&rdquo;, we can inadvertently communicate the wrong message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we discourage others from safely expressing their anxiety, then we are essentially saying to them that anxiety is a bad emotion, and that it is something to be done away with. It communicates to them that perhaps something is wrong with their Christian faith&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Kierkegaard referred to anxiety as our &ldquo;best teacher&rdquo; because of its ability to keep us in a struggle that strives for a solution, rather than opting to forfeit the struggle and slide into a possible depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, in a nutshell, is what Smith is going to come back to in nearly every chapter of the book: to recognize that God is continuously at work in us, and that our anxiety can be useful if it drives us forward to continued struggle and action. He says that God &ldquo;uses [your anxiety] to awaken you and help turn you toward Him.&rdquo; In chapter four he goes further to say that &ldquo;God wants you to pay attention to it [anxiety]. He wants you to listen to it. For in your anxiety God is speaking to you and He is encouraging you to not stay content with where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last few chapters, Smith puts his experience as a marriage and family therapist to good use as he provides some practical suggestions for working in areas that often cause anxiety; he discusses setting good personal boundaries, refining personal relationships, and asking for help.</p>
<p>With a topic like this, an author runs the risk of playing the victim card, but Smith handles it deftly. As one who has struggled with anxiety at various times in my adult life, I appreciated the reminder that God is at work in my life. While I <em>know</em> it to be true, Smith&rsquo;s book was a welcome kick-in-the-pants reminder.</p>
<p><em>Note: Moody Press provided me a free copy of this book asking only that I give it a fair review.</em></p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/05/25/the-road-trip.html">The Road Trip that Changed the World - Mark Sayers</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Australian pastor and author Mark Sayers put out a request for reviews of his new book, <em>The Road Trip that Changed the World</em> a few weeks ago, and I&rsquo;m happy today to take him up on it. I had previously read his book <em>Vertical Self</em> and enjoyed it quite a bit, so I was looking forward to his newest offering.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802409318/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802409318">The Road Trip that Changed the World</a></em> draws its title and chief topic from the classic American novel <em>On The Road</em> by Jack Kerouac. Sayers examines how Kerouac&rsquo;s novel incited a generation to leave the ideals of home, family, and place and instead to chase the dream of the road, the hope of whatever lays just beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>He spends a good chapter discussing our search for the transcendent, and notes how when we fail to notice and embrace the transcendence in the material here and now, we end up constantly looking for the next &ldquo;<em>woosh</em>&rdquo; - a fleeting moment of awe that makes us feel alive but quickly leaves us searching for the next hit.</p>
<p>The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to this examination of the shift in American culture brought on by Kerouac; the last third brings things around to the gospel. Sayers discusses Abraham as &ldquo;the first counter-cultural rebel&rdquo;, and traces a path through the Old and New Testaments, ultimately concluding that we need to reject the endless search for the &ldquo;woosh&rdquo; over the horizon, instead finding joy and meaning and transcendence in the here and now, as we experience true community and relationship with God.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll say this - Sayers has the spirit of the times nailed. If anything, I didn&rsquo;t respond to it more because it already seemed so familiar. His diagnosis of cynicism, distance, and the search for transcendence in &ldquo;woosh&rdquo; moments is right on. His prescription of embracing community and finding transcendence in experiencing God is a call appropriate for the time. If my cynical generation is willing to hear it, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802409318/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802409318">The Road Trip that Changed the World</a></em> is a great call back to what really matters.</p>
<p><em>Note: I was provided a free copy of the book in return for reading and posting a fair review.</em></p>

			 <p><em>This email went out on The Listserve this afternoon.</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s good news, and then there&rsquo;s GOOD NEWS. It&rsquo;s good news when an unexpected check comes in the mail, or when your kid comes home with improved grades. But GOOD NEWS is life-changing. Today I&rsquo;d like to talk about the best news I ever received. Here it is:</p>
<p>There is forgiveness for my failings. There is grace for my faults. There is love I can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>This was life-changing news for me, because at heart, I&rsquo;m rotten. I&rsquo;m selfish. I&rsquo;m a liar. Even when I do good things, too often I do them to try to impress other people, or to try to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m not that bad, even when I know deep down that I really am.</p>
<p>People talk about karma; karma scares me. I&rsquo;ll never be a good enough person to deserve what I want. This is why this really good news changed my life.</p>
<p>The GOOD NEWS is that God knows me, knows all about me - and that he loves me anyway. That he offers me forgiveness if I&rsquo;ll just accept it. And that he offers me grace every day, and the chance to really be a changed person.</p>
<p>God sent his son, Jesus, to earth for all of us. He lived a perfect life. He was the only person who karma really should&rsquo;ve fully rewarded, and instead he died in my place, in your place. And then he didn&rsquo;t stay dead, but instead demonstrated the power to conquer death. One day he&rsquo;s going to come back to earth to set things right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the best news I&rsquo;ve ever received. It changed my life. It can change yours, too, if you&rsquo;ll believe it.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago I heard about a little online project called <a href="http://thelistserve.com/">The Listserve</a>. Email mailing lists are one of the older forms of internet communication; everybody signs up to get the distribution, and when a post goes out, everybody gets it.</p>
<p>The idea of The Listserve is this: once the list hit 10,000 subscribers, the list moderators would pick one person per day to get to send a message to that list. A message about whatever the lucky person wants. The constraints: 400 words. No links or images. Just good old text.</p>
<p>I was intrigued. I signed up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Listserve hit 10,000 subscribers a couple of weeks ago and the messages started coming. They&rsquo;ve been entertaining, but mostly on the self-helpy. encouragey, lifehackey side of things. Still, while dozens of unread emails get deleted from my inbox every day, the one from The Listserve always gets read.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got an unexpected email: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been selected&rdquo;. I have until mid-day on Sunday to write 400 words that will be sent out to, at last check, more than 16,000 email inboxes. No pressure!</p>
<p>So what would you write if you could send an email to 16,000 people?</p>

<p>Leonard the Lonely Astronaut is quite a concept. Leonard is off on a solo intergalactic space flight, and while he&rsquo;s traversing the galaxy he&rsquo;s writing songs. We build a rocket ship set for Andy to record this thing in. It was awesome. The record has turned out awesome as well.</p>
<p>Ten bucks gets you the mp3 downloads today. Don&rsquo;t wait long, though, because in a few days it&rsquo;s going back into the AO vault until its official release in the fall.</p>
<p><em>Leonard the Lonely Astronaut is rated A for AWESOME. No space rocks were harmed in the making of this blog post. This author did not receive any compensation for writing this post other than the satisfaction of plugging a friend&rsquo;s record. In fact, this author is still waiting for the t-shirt that is coming with the Kickstarter pledge. Pictures to follow.</em></p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/28/some-thoughts-on.html">Some thoughts on Matt Chandler&#39;s move to lead Acts 29</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/28/some-thoughts-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-03-28 12:26:43 -0500">Mar 28, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So, it&rsquo;s official: <a href="http://www.acts29network.org/acts-29-blog/a-note-on-some-transitions/">Matt Chandler will be taking over as president of the Acts 29 church planting network</a>, moving the A29 headquarters from Seattle to Dallas. Pastor Matt will be taking over from Mark Driscoll, the fiery pastor of Mars Hill Church in Seattle, who helped found the network over a decade ago. While others have served as president of Acts 29 at various times over the past 10 years, it is still Driscoll (and, to a lesser extent, Darrin Patrick of The Journey in St. Louis) who primarily comes to mind when you say Acts 29.</p>
<p>The move from Driscoll to Chandler is a significant one, for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Strong enough to bring about change</strong>. In an evangelical ecosystem already dominated by leaders with strong personalities, Matt Chandler comes in to this leadership position as an already-established &ldquo;brand&rdquo;, separate from Acts 29. His story is fairly well known within evangelical circles, reluctantly accepting the pastorate of a dying Baptist church in the Dallas area only to turn it into a thriving multi-campus megachurch. More recently, his diagnosis of brain cancer and the following struggle through surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have been the subject of many a blog post and tweet over the last two and a half years. In short, Matt&rsquo;s standing within the evangelical community is strong and distinct enough from Mark Driscoll&rsquo;s that Matt has a reasonable chance of effecting real change where it&rsquo;s needed, rather than just existing in Driscoll&rsquo;s shadow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaders set the culture</strong>. While Chandler&rsquo;s theology is close in line with that of Driscoll and the Acts 29 network, culturally the lanky Texan will provide a sharp contrast to the Seattle spark plug. Over the past decade, young Acts 29 church planters have picked up not only Driscoll&rsquo;s theology but also his personal style. There seems to be a contractual obligation for Acts 29 pastors to love Mixed Martial Arts, tattoos, beer, and alternative music styles. Now, I don&rsquo;t know whether Chandler is a fan of MMA or not&hellip; but that just illustrates my point. If Pastor Matt can help separate the cultural stylism from the heart of Acts 29 ministry, it will be a very good thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Some distance from the controversy.</strong> There have been a couple of widely-discussed controversies in the past few months concerning Mars Hill Church in general, and Mark Driscoll&rsquo;s leadership strategies in particular. I don&rsquo;t want to comment on them here other than to say that it appears less than coincidental that the Acts 29 move comes on the heels of those issues. Maybe this move will help provide some distance and perspective for Acts 29 pastors who may be finding themselves uncomfortably trying to deal with these controversies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Room for Pastor Mark to refresh and grow.</strong> Whether you love him or hate him, you&rsquo;ve got to acknowledge that Mark Driscoll has been one busy dude over the past 10 years. Taking a church from zero to thousands, writing a gazillion books, teaching all over the evangelical conference circuit, and founding and growing a church planting network of 400+ churches, all while trying to also be a good husband and father to a growing family is enough to run anyone ragged. Add to it the stress from being a flashpoint for some contentious cultural issues (Don Miller named him &ldquo;Mark the cussing pastor&rdquo; for a real reason, after all), and maybe it&rsquo;s time for Pastor Mark to back it off just a bit and recharge. Bringing in Pastor Matt to fill a prominent role could help that happen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Time will tell how this move affects both pastors, their churches, and the Acts 29 network as a whole. We should take the time today, though, to lift up both of these men, their families, and their churches in prayer, asking God&rsquo;s blessing and protection on them as they serve.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/22/reasons-to-show.html">15 Reasons to Show Grace</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2012/03/22/reasons-to-show.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-03-22 09:36:18 -0500">Mar 22, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of days ago I posted a link to Rachel Held Evans' <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/15-reasons-i-left-church">&ldquo;15 Reasons I Left Church&rdquo;</a> on my Facebook wall, along with this comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we may not agree with all of Rachel Held Evans’ reasons, or her conclusion, those of us who are church leaders should be aware that Rachel is not alone - there are undoubtedly people sitting in our pews thinking the same things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To lay my cards on the table: I resonate with 7 or 8 of the 15 reasons that Rachel lists <em>at my current church</em>, and have been there with another couple of them at previous churches. On a few of the items I disagree with her doctrinally, and the frustrations I&rsquo;ve had over some of these issues haven&rsquo;t driven me to leave my church&hellip; but that may be because I&rsquo;ve chosen to simply be quiet about some of the topics rather than being vocal and stirring the pot. So I was curious to see what sort of responses I&rsquo;d get on FB, and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>
<p>The responses ran the gamut that I sort of expected; a couple friends identified with it quite strongly; a couple more felt the pain and frustration in her post but materially disagreed with most of the content or with how she said it; one graciously said that she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t get it at all&rdquo;, but that it was unhelpful whining. A college acquaintance reposted the link and got several responses from other college folks universally accusing Evans of whining and &ldquo;making it all about her rather than about God&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised by these reactions any more, but I am significantly saddened. Questioning is not sin, and wrestling with theological issues is a sign of healthy, involved, real faith, not a pointer toward apostasy. As Chaplain Mike over at InternetMonk.com <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/otd-obsessed-with-tornadoes-disorder">so eloquently ranted</a> a couple of weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <em>Islam</em> that sets forth submission and unquestioning acceptance as the ultimate in piety — not Christianity nor our parent faith as expressed in the Hebrew Bible. The faith we follow is one of lively dialogue between the Creator and his creatures. We question, complain, express our anger, cry out in pain, and bargain with God. Sometimes, if you believe the Bible, God even changes his mind at our behest. Like Jacob, we refuse to let him go until he blesses us. Like Moses, we argue with God. Like the psalmists, we groan and hurl curses toward the heavens. On the other hand, preachers like [name redacted - that&rsquo;s not the point] want us to get in line and behave. They rebuke our messiness, our humanness. They use the sovereignty of God to shut us up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you wrestle with doubt and questions on a daily basis. Or maybe you&rsquo;ve gone to the same church your whole life and never had the slightest inclination to doubt or argue with what is taught. Maybe you&rsquo;re somewhere in between. No matter where you are on that spectrum, though, the first response has to be grace.</p>
<p>Grace allows us to disagree with a brother or sister but embrace them anyway. There is a time for teaching and correction, but for the hurting brother or sister, that time comes after love has been lavished and healing has begun.</p>
<p>Jesus didn&rsquo;t rebuke the doubters; he encouraged them. Even Thomas, who after three years of following Jesus around really had more faith - even Thomas Jesus graciously called close and encouraged him to believe. The rebukes were reserved for those who thought they had it all together and were judging those who they thought didn&rsquo;t. Judging by the reaction I&rsquo;ve seen over the past few days, it&rsquo;s time to go back and learn that lesson again.</p>

			 <p>After recently finishing N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>Simply Jesus</em>, I&rsquo;ve been thinking again on Wright&rsquo;s view of the church&rsquo;s work as inaugurating the Kingdom of God here on the earth. Even though we know it won&rsquo;t come into perfection until Jesus' return, Wright says, is no excuse that we shouldn&rsquo;t start working on it now. I love this bit of reasoning from Wright&rsquo;s <em>Surprised by Hope</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would you say to someone who said, rightly, that God would make them completely holy in the resurrection and that they would never reach this state of complete holiness until then - and who then went on to say, wrongly, that therefore there was no point in even trying to live a holy life until that time? You would press for some form of inaugurated eschatology. You would insist that the new life of the Spirit, in obedience to the lordship of Jesus Christ, should produce a radical transformation of behavior in the present life, <em>anticipating</em> the life to come&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 
&hellip;Apply the same to Romans 8! How do you answer someone who says, rightly, that the world will not be completely just and right until the new creation and who deduces, wrongly, that there is no point trying to bring justice to the world&hellip; until that time? [I]nsist on inaugurated eschatology, on a radical transformation of the way we behave as a worldwide community, <em>anticipating</em> the eventual time when God will be all in all even though we agree things won&rsquo;t be complete until then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analogy that&rsquo;s been rattling around in my head in this election year is of the people of God as a political advance team. Say that you&rsquo;re the supporter of a candidate that you <em>know</em> is ultimately going to win. Your work as part of the advance team is to get the word out - in hopes that others will join the team, and to get the groundwork done so that things are ready when the winner finally shows up. Then, when the new ruler is in place, the people that were on his side the whole time are the ones who are rewarded - with good things from the kingdom and with places of responsibility.</p>
<p>So, too, in many ways with the kingdom. We <em>know</em> who the ultimate &lsquo;winner&rsquo; and coming ruler is. He has already conquered death and is the prototype of the new creation. But until He comes to set up his complete rule, we are here, spreading the word. Jesus is Lord. We&rsquo;re doing as much ground work as He enables us to do. 1 Cor 15 says that &lsquo;our works are not in vain in the Lord&rsquo;. Those works have a purpose. And when Jesus finally does return, it&rsquo;s not a stretch to the understanding that ruling and reigning with Christ may be something akin to the leadership positions and ambassadorships that come today to the early and long-time supporters of a new ruler.</p>
<p>So&hellip; get the word out. Get people on the team. Get the work started. Wait expectantly. Come soon, Lord Jesus.</p>

<li>After a couple of years of not traveling much, my spring looks like it&rsquo;s settling into a once-a-month travel groove. December: Florida. January: Seattle. February: Washington, DC. March: Wichita.</li>
<li>My not-quite-3-year-old daughter correctly used the phrase &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talkin'&rdquo; tonight. I could not have been more proud. (We&rsquo;ll get her to add the &ldquo;about&rdquo; one of these days.)</li>

			 <p>Stringfellow is just full of good stuff. Still in Chapter Two of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592448747/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592448747">An Ethic for Christians an Other Aliens in a Strange Land</a></em>, he says this about trying to understand God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biblical ethics do not pretend the social or political will of God; biblical politics do not implement &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; answers. In this world, the judgment of God remains God&rsquo;s own secret. &hellip; It is the inherent and redundant frustration of any pietistic social ethics that the ethical question is presented as a conundrum about the judgment of God in given circumstances. Human beings attempting to cope with <em>that</em> ethical question are certain to be dehumanized. The Bible does not pose any such riddles nor aspire to any such answers; instead, in biblical context, such queries are transposed, converted, rendered new. In the Bible, the ethical issue becomes simply: <em>how can a person act humanly now?</em> &hellip; Here the ethical question juxtaposes the witness of the holy nation - Jerusalem - to the other principalities, institutions and other nations - as to which Babylon is a parable. It asks: <em>how can the Church of Jesus Christ celebrate human life in society now?</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In the second chapter of William Stringfellow&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592448747/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592448747">An Ethic for Christians and Other Aliens in a Strange Land</a></em>, he continues to contrast the two cities mentioned in the latter half of Revelation: Babylon and Jerusalem. The Babylon of Revelation, he says, &ldquo;is archetypical of all nations.&rdquo; Those nations are principalities that, Stringfellow argues, by their very nature are anti-human; they serve themselves and work against that which is good. Jerusalem, on the other hand, is representative of Christians as &ldquo;an embassy among the principalities&rdquo; or as &ldquo;a pioneer community&rdquo;. (These phrases remind me instantly of N. T. Wright&rsquo;s similar description of the Church in <em>Surprised by Hope</em>.)</p>
<p>But Revelation, says Stringfellow, cannot be read as a &ldquo;predestinarian forecast&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To view the Babylon material in Revelation as mechanistic prophecy - or to treat any part of the Bible in such a fashion - is an extreme distortion of the prophetic ministry&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A construction of Revelation as foreordination denies in its full implication that either principalities or persons are living beings with identities of their own and with capabilities of decision and movement respected by God. And, in the end, such superstitions demean the vocation which the Gospels attribute to Jesus Christ, rendering him a quaint automaton, rather than the Son, of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While my Calvinist friends will quibble with the thought that humans have &ldquo;capabilities of decision and movement respected by God&rdquo;, I find that last sentence to be a compelling thought - that the work of Jesus Christ redeeming the world is magnified if his work is redeeming free and willful men, and that if, as in the strong Calvinist view, the whole cosmic saga is already completely fixed in history, then Christ is, in a way, just one more player in a pre-defined role.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Among the many Christmas gifts I received this year, I was quite pleased to get a book which had been sitting on my Amazon wishlist for several months: William Stringfellow&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592448747/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592448747">An Ethic for Christians &amp; Other Aliens in a Strange Land</a></em>. I will confess to having been completely ignorant of Stringfellow prior to someone online (I forget who) recommending this book, but he seems to have been a fascinating fellow; an Anglican layman who graduated Harvard Law only to move to Harlem and doing <em>pro bono</em> legal work for racial minorities and sex offenders.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="http://www.faith-theology.com/2009/03/william-stringfellow-special-offer.html">Ben Myers excellent summary</a> of Stringfellow&rsquo;s emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most striking feature of Stringfellow’s work is his powerful analysis and critique of the “principalities.” For him, the principalities are institutionalised forms of death. Institutions exist for the sake of their own expansion and self-perpetuation; they are not subject to human control, but are autonomous entities <em>vis-à-vis</em> all human agency. Human beings often believe “that they control the institution; whereas, in truth, the principality claims them as slaves” (<a href="http://wipfandstock.com/store/Free_in_Obedience"><em>Free in Obedience</em></a>, p. 99).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m only 35 pages into this slim 150-page volume - having read only the introduction and Chapter 1 - but I&rsquo;m immediately struck by how timely his critique of American government and corporate institutions is. Consider this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fall is where the nation is&hellip; Americans have become so beleaguered by anxiety and fatigue, so bemused and intimidated, so beset by a sense of impotence and by intuitions of calamity, that they have, for the most part, become consigned to despair. The people have been existing under a state of such interminable warfare that it seems normative. There is little resistance to the official Orwellian designation of war as peace, nor does that rhetorical deception come near exhausting the ways in which the people have found the government to be unworthy of credence or trust. Racial conflict has been suppressed by an elaborate apartheid; products which supposedly mean abundance or convenience turn out to contaminate or jeopardize life; the environment itself is rendered hostile; there is pervasive babel; privacy is a memory because surveillance is ubiquitous; institutional coercion of human beings has proliferated relentlessly. Whatever must be said of earlier times, in the past quarter century America has become a technological totalitarianism in which hope, in its ordinary human connotations, is being annihilated. &hellip; Americans have been learning, harshly, redundantly, that they inherit or otherwise possess no virtue or no vanity which dispels the condition of death manifest everywhere in the nation. (p. 19-20)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Stringfellow felt this strongly in 1973, what would he be thinking today in 2012?</p>
<p><em>An Ethic</em> is not quick reading but to this point every page has been worthwhile.</p>

			 <p>The end of the year means it&rsquo;s time for a summary of my last year&rsquo;s reading. Thankfully Goodreads keeps it easy for me to track things; I don&rsquo;t have to remember to do much more than log my books when I&rsquo;m done with them (on the handy Android app) and at the end of the year I have this nifty list.</p>
<p><strong>By the Numbers</strong> I finished 51 books this year, which made it an average year for me. 19 of those were non-fiction, leaving 32 as fiction. (You can see the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/80101-chris-hubbs?order=d&amp;per_page=100&amp;shelf=2011-reads&amp;sort=rating">whole list on Goodreads</a> if you really want to.) As usual, my non-fiction is basically theology, with a little bit of science and history thrown in. The fiction is essentially scifi, fantasy, and legal/political thrillers.</p>
<p><strong>Best fiction</strong> I gave 5-star ratings to 3 novels this year that were first-time reads. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0553380958"><em>Snow Crash</em></a> by Neal Stephenson. This is a futurist masterpiece of a novel that reads really fresh even though it was written back in 2000. Really good stuff.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/055358894X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=055358894X"><em>The Lies of Locke Lamora</em></a> by Scott Lynch. A fantasy novel that doesn&rsquo;t get so lost in the fantasy world that it forgets to have a plot. This is basically your favorite con-man story set in a fascinating fantasy world. I understand that the second book in the series is out now, so I need to get on it.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030788743X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=030788743X">Ready Player One</a></em> by Ernest Cline. This one has been at the top of a lot of year-end lists, and while it may not deserve that, it was very entertaining. Set in the future, but full of 1980&rsquo;s nostalgia, this was a fun, engaging read. (<a href="http://granades.com/2011/11/30/ready-player-one-reinforces-some-bad-geek-outlooks/">Stephen Granade has a good post</a> outlining some ways that <em>Ready Player One</em> could&rsquo;ve been changed to be a much better novel.)</li>

<p><strong>Best non-fiction</strong></p>
<p>There are two books that deserve mentions here.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595552464/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1595552464"><em>Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy</em></a> by Eric Metaxes.

</ul>
<p><strong>The Stinker</strong></p>
<p>There was only one book that I gave just one star to this year, and I won&rsquo;t even give it the honor of linking to it on Amazon: <em>Abyss</em> by Paul Hagberg. I can do no better than to quote my review from goodreads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should&rsquo;ve known just from the cover and flyleaf that this particular bit if genre fiction was going to be a train wreck. And yet, like a train wreck, once I started I couldn&rsquo;t look away.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Ridiculous plot premise, unbelievable protagonist (former CIA director turned bodyguard?!?), uninspired prose and underdeveloped characters fill the 400+ pages of this tome. The author seems contractually obligated to describe each female character in terms of breast size, but mishandles the interpersonal scenes so badly that you wonder if he&rsquo;s actually ever had an interpersonal relationship.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The cover of the book proclaims it to be &ldquo;A Kirk McGarvey Novel&rdquo;, leading me to believe that there are more books out there starring this ridiculous character. My advice: avoid them. Avoid this one, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my 2011. Here&rsquo;s hoping that 2012 finds me reading the best of books new and old. (Leave any recommendations in the comments below!)</p>

			 <p><a href="http://throughaglass.net/">Karibeth Baumann</a> has spent November blogging letters to her young son Atticus. <a href="http://throughaglass.net/archives/2011/11/30/dear-atticus-a-love-letter/">She finishes up today</a> with a beautiful summary that captures something of the revelation that parenting is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I was hanging out with some other women who were doing the thing where they complain about their husbands. Afterwards, one of them said to me that she noticed that I don’t complain about your dad. Which is true. I don’t talk about him dismissively or roll my eyes at him (except maybe when he makes a terrible joke). I enjoy spending time with him, and I try to take an interest in things that are important to him.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But for some reason, Atticus, I didn’t realize that I would feel the same way about you. I thought you would be a kid, and I am not so interested in kids. I am sorry, sweet boy, that I wasn’t more excited about you joining our family. I didn’t know you would be a person. I didn’t know you would be <em>you</em>. If I had known how bright and funny and wild you were going to be, I would have been so much more excited to meet you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a friend who, every time that we were expecting a child, would say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to meet him/her&rdquo;. The first time I heard it, it sounded a little weird to me. But getting to know the amazing people that your children <em>already are</em> is one of the great unexpected (at least to me) joys of parenting.</p>
<p>Kari&rsquo;s whole month of letters is well worth the read.</p>

			 <p>On this day set aside to be thankful, I want to review the events of the last six weeks, because they give me so much to be thankful for. Some of you have watched these things unfold in real-time on Facebook and Twitter, but it&rsquo;s worth summarizing here.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 3</strong> - My parents and grandma came to visit. Grandma hadn&rsquo;t been here to visit Iowa since Laura (now 7) was a baby. It was great to see her.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 3</strong> - The insurance adjuster called and told me that we had hail damage and that insurance would pay for a new roof for the house and garage.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 4</strong> - My sister Rebecca, who had recently rescheduled her wedding from next summer to Nov 5, called to ask if I would play music for the wedding, if Becky would be the matron of honor, and if our girls would be flower girls. Wedding would be held in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 6</strong> - While doing some shopping for dresses for the wedding, Becky gets a call from her sister that her Dad has been admitted to the hospital with intestinal issues.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 7 and following</strong> - Frenetic planning ensues. My brother Aaron is the master carpenter and construction guy of the family, so I contacted him to see if he had a weekend free to help me re-shingle the roof. He had one weekend free: Oct 14-15. I&rsquo;m thankful that Aaron and Emily were willing and able to come and help. We couldn&rsquo;t have done it without them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thankful for the patient customer service rep at Nationwide Mortgage who walked me through the claim process and got a check out promptly so that we had time to purchase roofing materials in time for the appointed weekend.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/roofing.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Oct 14 - 15</strong> - Aaron and Emily come down from Wisconsin to help do the roof. We got the house and garage done between Thursday afternoon and Saturday night. Thankful, too, for my buddy Mike who provided a burst of enthusiasm to our roofing project on Saturday morning the 15th. We wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten it done on Saturday without him. As it was, we finished the ridgeline of the garage roof by flashlight on Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 17</strong> - Somewhere around all of this activity, we managed to find a dress for Becky for the wedding at the first store we looked, and we found dresses for the girls within about 2 stores (and a lot of online browsing).</p>
<p><strong>Oct 20</strong> - The prompt mortgage folks sent the check for the remainder of the roof work. The money we saved by doing it ourselves paid for our tickets to fly to Seattle for the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 22</strong> - Becky&rsquo;s dad, still in the hospital and trying to recover from two surgeries, had a really good day, and Becky was able to video chat with him in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 24</strong> - <a href="/11/10/robert-esher-hubbs-iii-1939-2011/" title="Robert Esher Hubbs III, 1939 – 2011">Becky&rsquo;s dad passed away.</a> Thankful for our friends Mike and Kirsten who first offered to bring over dinner. When we told them thanks, but that we already had dinner planned, they stopped over unannounced with a half gallon of Coldstone ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 28</strong> - Becky was able to fly out to North Carolina to be with her family, and all of her siblings were able to be there. I was able to be away from work and stay at home with the girls.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 31</strong> - Becky&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s memorial service, and I took the girls around trick-or-treating&hellip; such fun!</p>
<p><strong>Nov 1</strong> - Becky got home&hellip; for which we were all very thankful.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 2</strong> - Packing like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 3</strong> - 9 AM flight out of the Moline airport. Thankful for the friendly guy we met in the terminal who was flying with two dozen Casey&rsquo;s donuts and shared a few with us. Thankful, too, for the friendly airline agent who got our seats rearranged so that we were all together on the plane.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/wedding.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Nov 5</strong> - Rebecca&rsquo;s wedding. Beautiful. Sounds funny to say it, but thankful for the Unitarian Universalists whose standards were low enough that they would let my sister have her wedding there on short notice. (She imported a Baptist pastor to do the ceremony.) Beautiful little chapel. Also thankful that KP the grumpy flower girl stayed quiet on my lap while I played music in the middle of the ceremony.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/wedding-piano.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Nov 7</strong> - Thankful that we got to hang out with Andrew and Heather for a day before we all had to go home. We don&rsquo;t get to see them too often.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 8</strong> - Flew home. Again, the flights were super-smooth. Thankful for a kids' play area at the DFW airport right next to our gate on our layover. Also thankful that we could hit Cracker Barrel for dinner after getting in to Moline.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 9</strong> - Back to work.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 19</strong> - Thankful for a pastor who read <a href="/11/10/my-brain-is-full-it-is-my-soul-that-needs-fed/" title="My brain is full; it is my soul that needs fed.">my blog post about being brain-full and soul-hungry</a>, and rather than preaching at me, bought me a book by one his favorite contemplatives. I&rsquo;m going to read it this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 20</strong> - Back on Worship Team, with a good new song that we got to do again as the post-closer. That last time felt like it was just for us, the team. It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Nov 24</strong> - at home with the family for Thanksgiving. Thankful for a couple of weeks where we&rsquo;ve been able to catch up and recover a bit.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been so blessed by God&rsquo;s faithfulness to us. For each thing listed here there were a dozen little things that I&rsquo;m forgetting. He is good, and I am thankful.</p>

			 <p>My friend <a href="http://gfmorris.com">Geof</a> has been writing a series of &ldquo;letters&rdquo; blog posts this month, addressed to family and friends. I&rsquo;ll admit to idly wondering whether I&rsquo;d rate a letter or not, but when I saw <a href="http://gfmorris.com/2011/11/16/dear-chris/">&ldquo;Dear Chris&rdquo;</a> show up in my RSS reader, and then read his post, I was a little bit challenged to know what to say.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a thought-provoking <a href="http://homebrewedchristianity.com/2011/11/15/crossed-out-have-we-overdone-the-crucifixion/">post by Bo Sanders up on Homebrewed Christianity today</a> wherein he asks what might be to many a startling question: have we overdone the crucifixion?</p>
<p>Sanders thinks that we may have. He observes that, for evangelicals on the blogosphere (and, I&rsquo;d add, in the current publishing market) it&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;all atonement theory, all the time&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my concern: in the resurrection God spoke a new word over the world. I would like to live into that new word and participate with God’s Spirit who was given as a gift and a seal of the promise.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To obsess on the cross and related atonement theories is to live perpetually in the old word and to camp in the final thing that God said about the old situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I reflect on my own journey, I can see how the churches in which I grew up did focus on the cross and atonement to the great neglect of the resurrection. Not that we didn&rsquo;t have amazing Easter celebrations, but somehow we never connected the dots between Christ&rsquo;s resurrection and our own eternal future. That omission is the reason that when, at age 30, I finally read N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Hope-Rethinking-Resurrection-Mission/dp/0310324726%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0310324726">Surprised by Hope</a></em>, it so rocked my theological world.</p>
<p>So I think it&rsquo;s a question worth thinking about. Do we overly focus on the cross as opposed to the other symbols of our faith? Is the focus on the cross a reflection of the evangelical personal sin/death/redemption focus, whereas a focus on the empty tomb and resurrection might drive a more corporate kingdom/social perspective?</p>
<p>To look at it another way: one of my daughter&rsquo;s favorite stories from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Storybook-Bible-Every-Whispers/dp/0310708257%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0310708257">Jesus Storybook Bible</a> (<em>highly</em> recommended if you have kids) is the one on the crucifixion. But if she requests that story, I make sure we have time to read two stories, because I refuse to stop reading with Good Friday; I want to get to resurrection morning. Is our focus on the cross a grown-up theological equivalent of continually reading the Friday chapter without the Sunday chapter? Food for thought, for sure.</p>

			 <p>I realize after writing these last couple of posts that they may make me sound like I&rsquo;m deeply unhappy or unsatisfied with my current church. Given that lots of my local church friends read my blog, let me assure you that it&rsquo;s not the case. I&rsquo;m happy with where we are as a church. I&rsquo;m encouraged and challenged by the teaching on a regular basis. I enjoy serving as a part of our music team. I&rsquo;ve made some good friends in the three years we&rsquo;ve been at Stonebridge, and I know those relationships will only deepen as time goes on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also involved in a community group (which is a new addition for us this year). It&rsquo;s possible that as we get to know our group better it will serve as some of the fellowship I&rsquo;m looking for. But those relationships take time to grow. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes. And I&rsquo;m also enthusiastic about the spiritual goals that our church leadership has set out for us this year. They&rsquo;re good ones. We just have to follow through on them and make them more than just words.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised at all if I get an email from my pastor sometime within the next week saying &ldquo;hey man, read your blog, anything we can talk about? How can we minister to you better?&rdquo; I love my pastor deeply and greatly appreciate the fact that he will notice it and be faithful as a shepherd to get with me and see what&rsquo;s up.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing. I don&rsquo;t think that what I&rsquo;m looking for is someone or some group to minister to me in a way that I&rsquo;ve been missing. What I&rsquo;m looking for is a community of believers who can join, side by side, in agreement that we are all broken and in need of the Gospel to minister to us on a daily basis.</p>
<p>[My apologies: 300+ words is hardly a quick clarification. <em>sigh</em>]</p>

			 <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s post wandered a bit in talking about the relevance of God&rsquo;s Word even as it is found in the daily readings and prayers of the church. When I started writing I was aiming for an appreciation of the BCP daily prayers and how they have ministered to me even in just the bit I have used them privately. Where I wandered, though, was to the observation that &ldquo;my brain is full; it is my soul that needs fed&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d like to work through that thought a little bit more today.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Certainly my personal quirks and characteristics help cause this condition: I read <em>a lot</em>. My mind never seems to let go of details and trivia. (Let&rsquo;s put it this way: I was the kid who at the age of 9 or 10 was reading through encyclopedias in the morning when I&rsquo;d wake up early.) I do a lot of synthesizing, by which I mean that I&rsquo;m not so good at creatively staking out my own position, but that I can listen to two or three other positions, evaluate them, and then pull together the pieces into a unified whole that makes sense to me. I also don&rsquo;t re-read much, because my brain says &ldquo;yeah, been there, read that&rdquo;, and it becomes hard to slow down and concentrate on something for a second time.</p>
<p>As a teenager and into my twenties my voracious book appetite combined with the wealth of good books on theological subjects served me well. I read a lot, learned a lot. My bookshelves are still filled with Lewis, Piper, Keller, Wright, Chesterton, and Spurgeon. I read through a lot of Schaeffer. I had a hard time finding the patience to appreciate some of the older theologians; how can you use so many words to say seemingly the same thing over and over? I could sit and talk theology with my church leaders, and before long that desire and aptitude, combined with the ability to apply it in practical ways, drew me into church leadership myself. (Somewhere along the way we had three kids, I over-committed to almost everything, burned out, and changed churches. But that&rsquo;s another story.)</p>
<p>Our current evangelical culture, and especially the neo-Reformed subculture within it (wherein I find currently myself) seem to highly favor this intellectual, bookish approach. Pastors like John Piper pen profusely. Pastor Mark Driscoll established his own publishing line of theological literature. Tim Keller seems to crank out a book a year (at least). It&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re not anybody until you&rsquo;ve published a book. But with very few exceptions, these books don&rsquo;t seem to really say anything new; the publisher is just pushing an update or a rehash with new cover art and the current big-name pastor as the author.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m in my mid-30&rsquo;s, things seem to have changed in my reading appetite. I can think of only three or four books I&rsquo;ve read in the past 5 years that have really made me just stop and go &ldquo;wow, what did I just read?&rdquo;. Now, maybe I&rsquo;m just failing to choose the right books. (In that case, I&rsquo;m open for recommendations, so please leave me a comment or send me an email, FB message, or tweet with your ideas.)</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m at a plateau where more head knowledge is not the answer. And this is where I file my desire (expressed yesterday) for the daily corporate practice of Scripture, prayer, and worship. Even that is undoubtedly not the magic answer. Maybe the struggling pursuit of the seemingly elusive daily &ldquo;quiet time&rdquo; is a more practical answer. But that, by itself, seems to private and insulated to me. I need community to go with it. Not community for study purposes; I just want to be with people who, like me, have that need in their soul to pray, worship, confess, and hear the Word on a regular basis. If you know where to find it, please let me know.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.boarsheadtavern.com">BHT</a> patron and <a href="http://twitter.com/johnthelutheran">Twitter friend</a> John H <a href="http://curlewriver.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/flash-evensong-and-the-crunchiness-of-gods-word/">posted earlier today</a> about the &ldquo;Flash evensong&rdquo; he participated in last night in front of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London. Since St. Paul&rsquo;s has been closed due to the Occupy London protests happening nearby, there was a &ldquo;flash&rdquo; decision to hold a standard Anglican evening prayer service in public outside of the cathedral. (John can be seen in this video, in the back row, wearing a blue, open-collared shirt.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8851864/Musical-flashmob-at-St-Pauls-Occupy-London-Stock-Exchange-protest.html">[Click here to see the video - I removed the embedded video because it annoyingly auto-plays every time my site is loaded.]</a></p>
<p>John notes how relevant even this standard, everyday service was for the situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What really struck me about the service, though, was this: the service was nothing more than the Church of England’s standard evening prayer for tonight, with the psalms and lessons taken from the lectionary, and the hymns and anthem being pretty standard fodder as well. And yet large portions of what was said, sung and prayed seemed to speak very directly to the context in which the service took place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further down in the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is that “crunchiness” [the against-the-mainstream aspects] of the word of God that turned an exercise that may have had an element of whimsy to it – or at least could have been seen as nothing more than a bunch of mostly white, mostly middle-class, mostly Anglican people being “well-meaning” – into something transcendent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few thoughts prompted by, if not directly related to, John&rsquo;s post:</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> this not-quite-comfortable evangelical would&rsquo;ve loved to be a part of that service. I was greatly moved just watching the short video.</p>
<p><strong>Second,</strong> I, too, have been struck by how often the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; readings seem to speak with the subversiveness of God&rsquo;s kingdom directly to the events of the day. The past few months I have tried, on a maddeningly infrequent basis, to start and end my day with the Book of Common Prayer morning and evening prayers. Even practiced as just a personal reading and prayer, the Scripture and prayer elements of the service have spoken directly to my heart with surprising regularity with regard to the events of my day, both personal and public.</p>
<p><strong>Finally,</strong> there is a part of my soul that yearns for a daily corporate practice like this. I would dearly love it if there were some local early-morning gathering around which I could schedule my day. What I really <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want is the (for me) awkward, informal Bible study and prayer groups that seem to abound in my evangelical church culture. Sitting around in a circle waiting for someone to come up with some thought on the day&rsquo;s passage and then sharing shallow prayer requests doesn&rsquo;t feed me in the near the way that the morning prayer liturgy could. I need that daily practice of praise, confession, Scripture and prayer, and the opportunity to do it corporately rather than off by myself.</p>
<p>My brain is full; it is my soul that needs fed.</p>

<p>&hellip;I love the stories of Jesus. As you probably know, he is always telling people to leave their work, their money, their families&ndash;all the things tied to very worldly desires, ones often thought to be fixed into the very nature of what it means to be human. Jesus steps between those narratives that seek to tell us what our nature is, and he tells us to leave it all to follow him. &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;<br>

He is the great &ldquo;I Got You.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What a great expression of Jesus' promise of provision as he calls us to unreservedly follow him.</p>

			 <p>Tech blogger Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/10/on-parenthood.html">took a detour</a> from his usual nerd programming yesterday to address a nearly universal topic: parenthood. He expresses something about the joys of parenting in a way I completely understood and couldn&rsquo;t have said half as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am holding Henry and I tickle him, I can feel him laughing all the way to his toes. And I realize, my God, I had forgotten, I had completely forgotten how unbelievably, inexplicably wonderful it is that any of us exist at all. Here I am with this tiny, warm body so close to me, breathing so fast he can barely catch up, sharing his newfound joy of simply being alive with me. The sublime joy of this moment, and all the other milestones – the first smile, the first laugh, the first &ldquo;dada&rdquo; or &ldquo;mama&rdquo;, the first kiss, the first time you hold hands. The highs are so incredibly high that you&rsquo;ll get vertigo and wonder if you can ever reach that feeling again. But you peak ever higher and higher, with dizzying regularity. Being a new parent is both terrifying and exhilarating, a constant rollercoaster of extreme highs and lows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s oldest is only 2 1/2, so I won&rsquo;t spoil it for him, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop at age 4. The delight of parenting and seeing your kids learn those new things and experience life in new ways is still a joy when they&rsquo;re 5 or 6 or 7. Even through the lows it is an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon we sat down on the couch with the girls to tell them that <a href="/11/10/robert-esher-hubbs-iii-1939-2011/">their Pops had passed away</a>. Laura, at 7, immediately broke into sobs and cried for a good 5 minutes. And then she was OK. No more words. I wonder how she&rsquo;s internalizing it, and if we&rsquo;ll end up talking more about it later. She&rsquo;s so much like me, it&rsquo;s scary. But little Addie, only 5, didn&rsquo;t have tears. She started to think about the news, and to talk through it. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;mom&rsquo;s dad passed away.&rdquo; Pause. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I still have a dad and mom. I&rsquo;d be sad if my dad passed away.&rdquo; Then we talked about how Pops is so much happier and healthier now that he&rsquo;s in heaven with Jesus, and about how we will see him again someday.</p>
<p>After that we spent a beautiful fall night in the backyard with burgers on the grill, cold beer (for me, not them), a fire in the firepit, marshmallows roasted, and friends who came by with ice cream. Then it was inside for pajamas, hugs and kisses, prayers, books, and bed. And quickly they slept, fresh to wake again as I was leaving for work this morning at some ungodly hour.</p>
<p>Some day future, God willing, my daughters and their families will sit out under the sky and raise a glass in memory of me. My prayer is that, when that time comes, they will be just as thankful and blessed as I was last night. God&rsquo;s goodness continues from generation to generation.</p>

			 <p>My wife&rsquo;s father [Yes, that&rsquo;s right - Becky&rsquo;s maiden name was Hubbs, my last name is Hubbs. It&rsquo;s unusual, and we&rsquo;ve heard all of the jokes.] (&ldquo;Bob&rdquo; to his friends, &ldquo;Pops&rdquo; to his grandkids and his kids-in-law who couldn&rsquo;t quite come to call him &ldquo;Dad&rdquo;) passed away this morning after a short illness. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll learn much more about him through the stories of family and friends over the next few weeks, but I wanted to get a few thoughts and memories down now while things are fresh.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pops was a man of quiet faithfulness. After serving in the US Marine Corps he followed God&rsquo;s call to go to the mission field, taking his family through language camp in south Texas (resulting, among other things, in his youngest daughter having her father&rsquo;s name listed as &ldquo;Roberto&rdquo; on her birth certificate) and then to the jungles of Indonesia. When health issues forced them to come back to the States, he and his wife served with <a href="http://www.jaars.org/">JAARS</a> for another 20+ years at the US headquarters location in Waxhaw, NC. He worked in the Construction and Maintenance department as a buyer, and he well knew his projects and materials. He was a fixture as an usher in his section of the Calvary Church balcony, and was a regular participant in a multitude of bowling groups, Bible Studies and prayer meetings.</p>
<p>Pops was a meticulous, detail-oriented man. When there was a job to be done, there was a correct tool to be used for it. Better to take more time and do it right than go for half-measures. He perpetually carried a notebook to record daily expenses. He always wanted to make sure he took care of any costs he incurred, sometimes to a hilarious extent. (Just last week we deposited a check that he sent to replace a lawn chair after one of ours tore slightly when he sat in it during his last visit here.) He was an extraordinarily generous and giving man; a trait which was passed down to all of his children in delightful ways.</p>
<p>I first met Pops in 1995 as an incoming freshman at LeTourneau University. At the time it was mostly a novelty, since I&rsquo;d never met another Hubbs that wasn&rsquo;t a relative of mine. (I took care of that 3 years later when I married his youngest daughter. Now I <em>still</em> haven&rsquo;t ever met a Hubbs that I wasn&rsquo;t somehow related to.) During the past 13 years as his son-in-law I got to know him better, and was regularly challenged by his patience, his faithfulness in service, and his disciplined consistency in the Word. (You could find him every morning up early reading his Bible and praying. Every. Single. Morning.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pops' greatest gift to me, though, was the 20 years that he invested in his youngest daughter before she became my wife. Becky&rsquo;s detail-oriented brain, her love for God, her consistent, faithful service, her enjoyment of travel and adventure, and her love of softball were all inculcated by her loving father in a way that all daughters deserve and very few actually receive. Our three daughters and I are all the richer thanks to his faithfulness.</p>
<p>Pops will be greatly missed, but we do not despair as those who have no hope. We look forward to the day when we will again laugh, run, bowl, and play softball with him in the resurrection. Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>

			 <p>So, that blogging every day thing didn&rsquo;t last long, did it? A little bit of work craziness and life busyness and all of a sudden it&rsquo;s been six weeks. So what&rsquo;s been going on? Since I last posted, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Took a one-day trip to Montreal and back on the company jet for a dinner meeting</li>
<li>Ran a <a href="http://newbofesthalfmarathon.com/">half-marathon</a> in <a href="http://newbofesthalfmarathon.com/BoFest_2011_Half%20Marathon_Overall.html">2:07:25</a></li>
<li>Got <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-241-285--7773-0,00.html">runner&rsquo;s knee</a> and had to avoid running for two weeks</li>
<li>Traveled to St. Louis for <a href="http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/conference/">the FAA&rsquo;s National Software and Airborne Electronic Hardware Conference</a> and took the family along</li>
<li>Went on from St. Louis to Nashville and helped <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> <a href="http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/16/building-day-1.html">build</a> a <a href="http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/20/building-day-2.html">space</a> <a href="http://andrewosenga.com/blog/2011/9/21/spaceship-concert.html">ship</a></li>
<li>While in Nashville, got to hang out with the estimable <a href="http://www.gfmorris.com">Geof Morris</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/michaelaterry">Mike Terry</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/stockment">Josh Stockment</a></li>
<li>Also while in Nashville, went on a quick jaunt with Geof down to Huntsville, AL to meet <a href="http://granades.com/">Stephen and Misty Granade</a>, who were even more awesome than I expected them to be.</li>
<li>After meeting Stephen, caught up on all 9 existing episodes of his quite hilarious podcast <em><a href="http://disasterpiece-theatre.com/">Disasterpiece Theatre</a></em>.</li>
<li>Developed and rolled out a <a href="http://www.cornerstone-marion.org">new website project</a></li>
<li>Got a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">27&quot; iMac</a></li>
<li>Started piano lessons for my oldest daughter</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah. I&rsquo;m still struggling with how to best pull together the content that I share every day via Google Reader, Google+, and Twitter. I&rsquo;d like to be able to centralize it here&hellip; but I haven&rsquo;t managed to work that into my process yet. I&rsquo;ll keep trying.</p>

			 <p>So I had a Lipton diet green tea yesterday. The whole bottle had 30 mg of caffeine. From what I can tell, that&rsquo;s less than half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. Still, drinking that bottle of tea made me jittery for a couple of hours. Couldn&rsquo;t stop bouncing my legs. Craziness. I am now more motivated than ever to mostly stay away from the stuff.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did my second 10-mile run yesterday and completed it with sub-10-mile pace and without feeling like I was going to die. I figure I need to do at least one more of those prior to the <a href="http://www.newbofesthalfmarathon.com/">New Bo Fest Half Marathon</a> on September 4. Looking forward to that race&hellip; and to getting it done with.</p>

			 <p>Today marks the beginning of my second week without caffeine.</p>
<p>I started out the month of August with a few rather stringent goals: drink nothing but water, stay away from sugar, and eat moderately. I was hoping that the combination of those goals and the running I need to do to prepare for the half marathon coming up in September would help me shed some pounds that have been stubbornly sticking around.</p>
<p>The nothing-but-water rule was really a push back against all of the Diet Pepsi I&rsquo;d been drinking over the past couple of weeks. (All-day work meetings with food provided become avenues to just mainline the stuff.) But after a few days I decided I really needed the option to drink something other than just water, so I&rsquo;m allowing myself an occasional Crystal Light or a decaf iced tea.</p>
<p>The no sugar thing has been a harder sell. I did really well for the first four days, but over the weekend there were a couple of desserts that were impossible to pass up. I at least tried to keep them small and made sure that they didn&rsquo;t push me way over my calorie count for those days.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t stepped back on the scale this week, so I&rsquo;m not sure if that first week helped me with the weight any - might take a week or two more to see that happen. But I&rsquo;m interested in how my body is responding to the lack of caffeine. Or not responding, as the case may be. I had one withdrawal headache on the second day. Other than that, I&rsquo;ve been feeling pretty much the same as ever. I have been finding that I need a bit more sleep, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s due to lack of caffeine or due to the fact that I&rsquo;ve been running a lot and tiring myself out that way.</p>
<p>So, the half marathon is 4 weeks from yesterday, so I have some more time to see how it turns out&hellip; and to get some miles in. I want to get at least a couple more 10 mile runs in before then, and need to supplement those with a lot of 5- and 6- mile runs. Good to have a goal, but it will also be good to get past it and back off to something a little more normal and sustainable come September.</p>

			 <p>Andrew Jones (aka &ldquo;Tall Skinny Kiwi&rdquo;), &ldquo;itinerant social entrepreneur&rdquo;, wandering missionary and prolific blogger, has a <a href="http://tallskinnykiwi.typepad.com/tallskinnykiwi/2011/08/the-nines-2011-pick-me.html">hard but true, and dare I say, prophetic post</a> on his blog today. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that the piece is headlined as an appeal to be chosen to speak on <a href="http://thenines.leadnet.org/">The Nines</a>, because the bulk of the post is about the changes coming for the church and for Christian culture.</p>
<p>Did I mention it was a hard word? Here are just a few of his headline points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Church as we have known it is not the first option for the next generation. Neither is it an affordable option. It is not sustainable in the long term.</li>
<li>Seminaries are in trouble.</li>
<li>The Christian music industry as we have supported it, is over.</li>
<li>The Christian publishing industry, as we have enjoyed it over our lifetime, is over.</li>
<li>The church planting movement, in its ecclesiocentic and unholistic form, has played out its song and is now doing an unrequested encore.</li>
<li>Prayer meetings are focused on making our outdated methods work better.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;If Americans want to play in the sandbox in global missions and sustainable holistic church ministry&rdquo;, says Jones, &ldquo;then they need to listen to what the majority world is already discovering and implementing.&rdquo; He says that we can and should use this time of recession to re-orient and re-calibrate our thoughts on ministry and mission rather than just asking for more money.</p>
<p>You should <a href="http://tallskinnykiwi.typepad.com/tallskinnykiwi/2011/08/the-nines-2011-pick-me.html">go read the piece</a> to hear his whole argument. Hard as it may be, I think Jones is right.</p>

			 <p>Running isn&rsquo;t exactly a new topic on this blog. I <a href="/06/08/running/">first decided to lace up my shoes</a> back in August of 2006 and <a href="/06/09/this-n-that-3/">ran my first 5k</a> in September of that year. After the initial 5k I never trained much for the races. I&rsquo;ve run the local Hog Wild Days 5k every year since then, but even then never trained much or cranked up the pace much. My race times evidenced that fact: I ran that first 5k in 31 minutes and change, and 4 years later I was still running right about 30 minutes for a 5k.</p>
<p>At some point this spring, though, some switch flipped in my head, and running became enjoyable and something of a compulsion. I started <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/cjhubbs/">tracking my runs</a> using runkeeper.com and being more regular with my running. I got in more than 50 miles in April, 47 in May, slacked in June whilst on vacation, and now I&rsquo;m back at it in July.</p>
<p>My times are showing the improvement. I felt pretty darn sluggish for the Hog Wild Days 5k this year and still completed it in 27 minutes. Then I ran the Alliant Energy 8k on July 4th and <a href="http://www.fifthseasonrace.com/content/results/2011-8k.htm">completed that</a> in right at 45 minutes.</p>
<p>At the moment I haven&rsquo;t made a real decision on whether to work for distance or speed next, but I&rsquo;m leaning towards distance. I ran a 6-mile route this morning and really enjoyed it. I&rsquo;ve been tossing around the idea of running the New Bo Half Marathon over Labor Day weekend, but haven&rsquo;t been brave enough to send in the registration form yet. Either way, it&rsquo;s time for a new pair of shoes between now and then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working on understanding <em>why</em> I enjoy running as much as I do. Partly it&rsquo;s the personal challenge, proving to myself that I can stretch my body beyond where it&rsquo;s gone before. Partly it&rsquo;s also so nice to have my body feeling perpetually tired and sore rather than slow and sluggish. It&rsquo;s also nice when the running helps take off a few pounds.</p>
<p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll keep with the running long-term as seriously as I have this year, but it&rsquo;s something I want to keep as a regular part of my life. 30 years from now I&rsquo;d love to be one of those old guys I saw in the race on Monday, still chugging along and running 5 miles faster than a lot of the young guys.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2011/06/blessed_redunda.html">Skye Jethani&rsquo;s question about efficiency and effectiveness</a> after my brother Andrew prodded me with some comments. Andrew argues for prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If reaching people with the Gospel is the ultimate goal, then efficiency (the stewardship of resources towards the greatest gospel advance possible) and effectiveness (the fruit of that stewardship) is essential. We’re asking, ‘what do we have that is being used for missions, and how well is it doing its job?’ If you’re not constantly asking those two questions than you’re not really going to be ‘effective’..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think that we actually more or less agree on the need for efficiency and effectiveness, but are looking at it in different perspectives. Because the goal is two-fold: &ldquo;preach the Gospel&rdquo;, and &ldquo;make disciples&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now, maybe we can preach the Gospel most effectively by just taping the &ldquo;best of&rdquo; sermon series from and distributing it via video to every corner of creation. But does that help us with disciple-making?</p>
<p>Or does it possibly stunt our disciple-making efforts because it <em>takes away</em> opportunities for men to become teachers and hone their teaching skills, and for local pastors to tailor teaching to speak specifically to the needs of their local congregation?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting a ways off here from Jethani&rsquo;s original point, maybe. And yeah, I&rsquo;m sure any well-run megachurch is going to need an amazing elder board to hold it together. But I think we would do well to learn from the example long set before us: of small, local churches with local leadership, benefiting occasionally from the all-star teacher who was visiting town. Maybe efficiency and effectiveness comes through grassroots insurgency rather than from video sermon distribution.</p>
<p>Having written all that&hellip; if you need me, I&rsquo;ll be off catching up on Matt Chandler&rsquo;s podcast.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2011/06/blessed_redunda.html">an excellent post from Skye Jethani today</a> which hits close to home for me in a number of ways. First off, he&rsquo;s taking a lesson from the redundancy that is built in to airplanes, making them the safest way to travel. (I&rsquo;m a certification engineer at an avionics company, so I am <em>very</em> familiar with what he&rsquo;s talking about.) Second, he asks what the church should be learning on this issue. It is wise to structure a large church organization around a &ldquo;main man&rdquo;?</p>
<p>(This also hits home because there was a time in my history when I was told that I would cause great damage to my particular church if I chose to follow what I felt was God&rsquo;s leading to go elsewhere. I wasn&rsquo;t the pastor - only an elder and part-time worship leader. I went ahead and left anyway. The church, of course, was fine. But that&rsquo;s a different story.)</p>
<p>Jethani is asking questions about places like Bethlehem Baptist (John Piper) and Redeemer NYC (Tim Keller), both of which are large organizations built around single, superstar pastors. (Other churches quickly come to mind - Mars Hill Seattle (Mark Driscoll), for instance.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;whenever I’ve discussed this inherent danger [of a single failure affecting multiple congregations] with those operating video-based multi-site systems they invariably mention the efficiency and effectiveness of their model. Who can disagree? Utilizing one highly gifted person to impact thousands of people in multiple cities is unquestionably efficient&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But <strong>who decided that efficiency and effectiveness were the highest values for ministry</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boom. Awesome question. Jethani goes on to enumerate some reasons why a more redundant, less efficient organization might well be healthier for churches. <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2011/06/blessed_redunda.html">It&rsquo;s worth a read</a>.</p>
<p>And oh, yeah - about those airplanes? Some of the most amazing safety engineering ever done happens on those aircraft. They include redundancy in ways you&rsquo;d never imagine. Very cool stuff.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m still catching up a bit, but I definitely want to recommend <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/tales-of-demonic.html">this piece by Richard Beck</a> wherein he examines how bureaucratic structures in the world tend to dehumanize us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In each of the [stories above] human beings are not interacting directly. We are, rather, interacting through the power structures of the world. I don&rsquo;t know the name of the man in my backyard about to turn off my electricity. And he doesn&rsquo;t know my name. Our relationship is, rather, defined by our locations in a bureaucratic power structure. He&rsquo;s an agent of the electric company. I&rsquo;m an address on his work order. That is how our relationship is defined. A relationship stripped of its humanity. And as a consequence I have to work mightily to treat this man with respect. He isn&rsquo;t to blame. But everything about this dehumanized interaction makes me want to yell at him. To direct my anger at him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all been there, haven&rsquo;t we? How easy it is to rage against people who are only trying to do their job. Beck calls us to vigilance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On and on it goes. If we are not <strong>careful</strong>, if we are not <strong>vigilant</strong>, if we are not <strong>prayerful</strong> modern life will dehumanize us. It is a demonic force that must be resisted. I keep going back to something William Stringfellow said, we must struggle to <strong>live humanely in the midst of the Fall</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he closes with a fantastic illustration that I won&rsquo;t copy here, but that is worth reading in full; <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/tales-of-demonic.html">go take a look</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2011/06/28/a-rant-about.html">A Rant about a Church Sign</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There is a Baptist church in our town that I drive by on my way to church at least a couple of times a week. For the past couple of weeks they&rsquo;ve had a message up on their sign that has irritated me to no end. Now, sayings on church signs have a way of being trite and cutesy, but this one has surpassed that and gone on to outright misguided ridiculousness.</p>
<p>First, the quote from the sign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me come down there!&rdquo; &ndash; God</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here begins the rant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think of ways this could be interpreted, and no matter how you do it, they&rsquo;re all bad. Some things it could be construed to be saying:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God isn&rsquo;t actually involved down here on earth right now.</strong> Apparently He&rsquo;s somewhere distant, and just observing. That&rsquo;s obviously incorrect.</li>
<li><strong>People on earth are at some marginally-acceptable level of sinfulness right now.</strong> Wrong again! We&rsquo;re all sinful. No one does good. We&rsquo;ve all missed the mark.</li>
<li><strong>If we cross some line of sinfulness, then&hellip; BLAM! God&rsquo;s gonna come down and make us pay!</strong> No. God isn&rsquo;t up there threatening to blow us away. He promised he wouldn&rsquo;t flood the earth again and wipe everything out. (I have to remind myself of that when the springtimes get abnormally rainy&hellip;) And He poured out His wrath on Jesus. Jesus died so we don&rsquo;t have to.</li>
<li><strong>God coming down here to Earth is a thing to be feared.</strong> Uh, no. God coming to Earth in the person of Jesus is the <em>best</em> thing that&rsquo;s ever happened to Earth and humankind.</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume somebody at that church saw the message on the internet somewhere, thought it was clever, and put it up without even thinking any further about it. It pains me that the message has been there for weeks now and apparently no one at the church has discernment enough to recognize the gross error and get it taken down.</p>
<p>A message to church sign designers everywhere: if you&rsquo;re going to put a weekly message on your sign, keep it informational, or, at worst, cutesy. This sign is a big steaming pile of pseudo-cleverness served with a nice heretical gravy on top. Make it go away.</p>

			 <p>Richard Beck has <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-stopped-on-interruptibility.html">a great piece today</a> on interruptibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, interruptibility is a form of welcome and hospitality. It is a way of making room for others. This space we create is less a physical space than a <em>temporal</em> space, making room in your To Do list, making space so we can slow down and pay attention to others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interruptibility is, he says, &ldquo;a sign that we are moving at the speed of love.&rdquo; (What a great line!)</p>
<p>Beck goes on to explore some other traits that our interruptibility (or lack thereof) demonstrates. It&rsquo;s worth reading <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2011/06/jesus-stopped-on-interruptibility.html">the whole thing</a>.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve reworked my 5K playlist. This latest incarnation may be a little heavy on Arcade Fire, but I&rsquo;ve been listening to them <em>a lot</em> while I&rsquo;ve been running this spring, and the tempos of the songs work really well. Anyway, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Modern Man&rdquo; - Arcade Fire</li>
<li>&ldquo;Beautiful Day&rdquo; - U2</li>
<li>&ldquo;Brighter Day&rdquo; - Gungor</li>
<li>&ldquo;City With No Children&rdquo; - Arcade Fire</li>
<li>Someone Else&rsquo;s Arms - Mae</li>
<li>&ldquo;After The Garden&rdquo; - Andrew Osenga</li>
<li>&ldquo;Month of May&rdquo; - Arcade Fire</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hometown Glory&rdquo; - Adele</li>
</ol>
<p>If I finish in the time I&rsquo;m hoping for, I&rsquo;ll be somewhere in the middle of &ldquo;Month of May&rdquo; when I cross the finish line. The Adele song is a fantastic cooldown song.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping for good weather in the morning and a good race time!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2011/06/17/the-right-kind.html">The right kind of tolerance</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>&ldquo;Tolerance&rdquo; is a much misunderstood word these days. I remember hearing a barn-burner of a chapel message back in college from Josh McDowell, warning us that the biggest sin in the worlds eyes in upcoming days would be &ldquo;intolerance&rdquo;, which they would define (roughly) as &ldquo;saying someone&rsquo;s beliefs are wrong&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that it&rsquo;s <strong>impossible</strong> to be tolerant if you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> disagree with someone, since tolerance is, by definition, allowing the existence of something <em>that you disagree with</em>. I was recently witness to an illustration&hellip;</p>
<p>Our associate pastor, Robin, and his wife, Kathryn, hosted a foreign exchange student last year. His name is Ahmed and he is from Egypt. When I first heard about him (just a few weeks ago - guess I&rsquo;m out of the loop!) I thought to myself <em>maybe he&rsquo;s Coptic Orthodox or something&hellip; that&rsquo;d make sense if he&rsquo;s living with a Christian pastor&hellip;</em> but nope - Ahmed is a Muslim. Some experience <em>that</em> must&rsquo;ve been, I thought.</p>
<p>Then two weeks ago, after the sermon in our Sunday morning service, Pastor Robin invited Ahmed to join him on the platform and they spent nearly 15 minutes discussing Ahmed&rsquo;s year here. Ahmed told the story of his initial trepidation of being hosted by a Christian pastor. He told a couple of funny fish-out-of-water stories that had everyone laughing. He admitted that American high school was a much more laid back and pleasant experience than his all-boys French Catholic high school back in Egypt. And he spoke proudly of the Egyptian people&rsquo;s overthrow of the Mubarak regime in this spring&rsquo;s revolution.</p>
<p>Then Robin invited Ahmed to share with us the basic beliefs of Islam, and asked him to talk a bit about how Muslims view Jesus and what some of the key differences are between Islam and Christianity. Our church listened intently as Ahmed described the Five Pillars of Islam and that the Muslims revere Jesus as a prophet though they don&rsquo;t believe that he was crucified and resurrected.</p>
<p>When the discussion time was over, Pastor Robin prayed for Ahmed, asking God to guide him and watch over him as he returned to Egypt. Then Ahmed was presented with a parting gift: a McDonald&rsquo;s gift card. (Apparently Ahmed has developed a taste for Big Macs.)</p>
<p>This, my friends, was a beautiful display of the right kind of tolerance. There was no pretense in the entire conversation (or, clearly, in the entire relationship between Ahmed and his &ldquo;parents&rdquo; Robin and Kathryn) that they agreed religiously. However, the love and respect between them as they discussed their differing beliefs and shared experience of the past year was evident and obviously <em>real</em>. Ahmed was also quite gracious in his willingness to be prayed for by a man who believes so differently. (I sometimes wonder whether I and my Christian brethren would be as gracious if the roles were reversed.)</p>
<p>That Sunday morning discussion between Robin and Ahmed was valuable for all of us in several ways. We learned a little more about Islam. We gained a better appreciation for seeing our own Christian practice through foreign eyes. And whenever some rabble-rousing politician or media fear-monger wants to stereotype Muslims, we&rsquo;ll be able to look back to this handsome, genial, friendly young man and remember that those who follow Islam are, for the <em>vast</em> majority, like him, and not like those extremists that we are told to fear.</p>
<p>My friends, this is true and good tolerance, and I am all for it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There&rsquo;s a great post over on Image Journal <a href="http://imagejournal.org/page/blog/bad-christian-art">addressing the concerns of &ldquo;bad christian art&rdquo;</a>. Author Tony Woodlief is clearly fed up with movies and books that pander to &ldquo;good Christian people who judge art by criteria like message and wholesomeness and theological purity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bad art derives, he says, from bad theology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To know God falsely is to write and paint and sculpt and cook and dance Him falsely. Perhaps it’s not poor artistic skill that yields bad Christian art, in other words, but poor Christianity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to address Christian books specifically, noting &ldquo;common sins&rdquo; including &ldquo;neat resolution&rdquo;, one-dimensional characters, sentimentality, and cleanliness. (In my opinion: any reader of books marketed as &ldquo;Christian fiction&rdquo; will immediately recognize these issues with pretty much any such novel.)</p>
<p>He brings it home with some piercing questions about how the proliferation of bad Christian art reflects on the state of the evangelical church that embraces and consumes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, if Christian novels and movies and blogs and speeches must be stripped of profanity and sensuality and critical questions, all for the sake of sparing us scandal, then we have to wonder what has happened that such a wide swath of Christendom has failed to graduate from milk to meat.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And if we remember that theology is the knowing of God, we have to ask in turn why so many Christians know God so weakly that they need such wholesomeness in order for their faith to be preserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My friend (and talented songwriter) <a href="http://www.ilikeandy.com">Andy Osenga</a> often talks about two approaches to songwriting as a Christian (and I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t original to him, but I heard it from him): you can either write <em>about</em> the light, or you can look out at the world and write about <em>what the light shows you</em>.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the art that Woodlief is talking about here <em>doesn&rsquo;t fall into either of those categories</em>. The purveyors of this particular flavor of Christian art have rather chosen to ignore the reality of what the light shows them. Instead, they paint an unrealistic fantasy world that reflects what they hope might be.</p>
<p>We, and all of creation, are broken, and in need of redemption. If we pretend through our art that this Christian life is neat and tidy and that all the threads resolve by page 350, not only do our stories ring hollow, but we fail to acknowledge the greatness of the work of redemption that Jesus Christ is doing in the world. Christians must do better.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: after passing along a rant like this, I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t recommend the work of Christians I know who</em> are <em>creating good art. Hit up <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/">The Rabbit Room</a> to find excellent art, books, and music that may not always be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; but will always be good.</em></p>

			 <p>A wonderful response to NYT editor Bill Keller&rsquo;s hand-wringing post on social media was written today by Mimi Johnson as <a href="http://stevebuttry.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/guest-post-by-mimi-johnson-with-social-media-advice-for-bill-keller/">a guest post on her husband&rsquo;s blog</a>. Ms. Johnson has experienced the social media revolution first-hand as the wife of a newspaperman, and her insight (and writing chops) come through loud and clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the Times blogger <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/this-is-your-brain-on-twitter/">Nick Bilton’s well-reasoned post about his column</a>, Mr. Keller offered that he “praised Twitter effusively.” No, I’d say his praise of Twitter was a perfunctory sop while his criticism of it was effusive. Why? Even though Mr. Keller <em>understands</em> the various tentacles of social media intellectually, emotionally he doesn’t <em>like</em> them. He is undoubtedly a sophisticated man, who must have realized long ago that change always brings loss as well as gain. Indeed, he mentions his own father’s regret at the passing of the slide rule in favor of the calculator. But, as the ancient saying goes, “the dogs bark but the caravan moves on.” Mr. Keller recognizes the social media caravan and he does not like it one bit. So how does he bark his disapproval? By trying to make those who embrace it feel stupid for doing so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>I met Ms. Johnson once at a Cedar Rapids tweetup. In addition to being a wonderful writer (as this post demonstrates), I can attest that she is also a gracious, charming and delightful woman.</p>

			 <p>I started my dalliance with running nearly 4 years ago. I was looking for some motivation to get off the couch and lose some weight, and figured that if I signed myself up for a race that the potential embarrassment of walking the whole thing might motivate me into action. I didn&rsquo;t train too hard, but I made it through my first 5k in around 32 minutes.</p>
<p>I never devoted too much time to running. I&rsquo;d hit the gym maybe once or twice a week when the weather was bad and do a couple of miles on a treadmill; maybe run a couple of miles outside if the weather was good. And I didn&rsquo;t notice huge improvements in my times or endurance, but I kept at it, albeit intermittently.</p>
<p>Then came April 1 of this year. I don&rsquo;t know what possessed me, but I was on the treadmill at the gym and ran 5 miles in 49 minutes. And, as with a few other times in my life, it was as if some sort of mental switch flipped. Suddenly running is enjoyable, something I don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to do, but rather that I <em>want</em> to do. (I wish I could figure out what it is that causes that switch to flip. There are other places in my life it&rsquo;d be useful&hellip;)</p>
<p>I started <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/cjhubbs/activity">tracking my runs on Runkeeper</a>, which was great. (Android app + GPS in phone = easy run tracking!) I ran 16 times in April, for a total of just over 52 miles. I&rsquo;ve been a little bit of a slacker in May so far - have only run 3 times for 12+ miles, but that included a 6-mile run. I&rsquo;m losing weight (slowly), definitely building endurance, and feeling great doing it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been tossing around ideas for a season-long motivator to keep me pushing this summer, and the one that&rsquo;s tantalizing me is the <a href="http://www.newbofesthalfmarathon.com/index.html">New Bo Fest Half Marathon</a>, held Labor Day weekend in Cedar Rapids. I don&rsquo;t know how quickly I can add endurance and distance, but it seems like it&rsquo;d be doable if I&rsquo;m committed to putting in the time. I found a great little training app for my phone (<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=c.isakson.race.predictor.paid">Epic Runner</a>) and I&rsquo;m using it to push me along. I&rsquo;ve not yet been brave enough to sign up for the race, but I think I will&hellip; soon.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been at least a week since <a href="http://www.confessingevangelical.com/">John H.</a> linked <a href="http://www.jamesalison.co.uk/texts/eng50.html">this James Alison essay</a> on Twitter, so it&rsquo;s high time that I passed it along with my recommendation. It&rsquo;s not light reading, but it&rsquo;s quite an insightful consideration of Jesus' command to love your enemies.</p>
<p>In the first half of the essay Alison explores &ldquo;mirror neurons&rdquo; and infant imitation to bring us to an understanding from science that our minds and actions are influenced by those around us. He summarizes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With this we are well on the way to being able to understand, for the first time rigorously, how it is that what we normally call the “self” of each one of us is constituted by the desire of another. How it is in fact that the self of each one of us, rather than being something hermetic, locked into itself until we choose to enter into relationship with what is other than us, is in the first instance a real but malleable construct which is a symptom of the way <em>this body</em> has been brought into being and is held in being by the relationships which preceded it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the remainder of the essay Alison then brings home how Jesus' instruction to love our enemies beautifully works within this scientific understanding&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, Jesus says, this being run by the adulatory other, or the excoriating other, which is the same thing, has nothing to do with God. What God’s love looks like is being creatively for the other without being defined over against the other in any way at all. That is what is meant by grace and freedom. It is going to involve breaking through the strong-seeming but ultimately fragile dichotomies of “in group” and “out group”, “pure” and “impure”, “good guys” and “bad guys” which are quite simply the ambivalent functions of our cultural identity, and coming to love other people <em>without any over against at all</em>. Living this out is going to look remarkably like a loss of identity, a certain form of death. And living it out as a human is what it is to be a child of God, and to be perfect as the heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve hung in through those two quotes, I really encourage you to <a href="http://www.jamesalison.co.uk/texts/eng50.html">go read the whole thing</a>. Alison has much good insight here about how the attitudes of the groups we&rsquo;re in and the attitudes we take towards those around us affect us&hellip; well worth the read.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The interwebs have been going gaga for weeks now about the British royal wedding, and this morning Twitter and Facebook are bursting with comments as this spectacle is broadcast live around the world.</p>
<p>There seem to be two primary types of online responses this morning. First, there are the adoring. They got up in the wee hours of the morning (US time) to watch on TV. People who are usually sleeping in until mid-morning were posting ISN&rsquo;T IT ALL A FAIRY TALE OMG SQUEEE! at three AM. It is, as I read somewhere yesterday, sort of the ultimate in reality TV, and these folks were up to enjoy every minute of it.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the noise are the cynical. Not content to simply ignore the hoopla, they tweeting regularly about how they couldn&rsquo;t care less, about how it&rsquo;s so wasteful and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, about how they wish the TV stations would get back to talking about &ldquo;real news&rdquo;. Even those in my Twitter feed who aren&rsquo;t typically cynical seem to have cynicism drawn to the surface by this event.</p>
<p>Now, from the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen (I didn&rsquo;t get up to watch it), the wedding was a beautiful, colorful spectacle, full of pomp and pageantry. The bride was beautiful, the groom impressive in uniform, and the service fittingly solemn. I wish for William and Kate what I wish for any newly married couple: decades of faithful love for each other, and true and personal knowledge of the God in whose name their marriage was performed.</p>
<p>That all being said, I&rsquo;d like to encourage some moderation in the whole thing. (Stances like this are why my blog doesn&rsquo;t have many readers!) The up-at-three-AM crowd need to take a grain of truth from the cynics, and remember that fairy tale dreams are fleeting and quickly replaced by the troubles of the real world. But the cynics need to heed some truth from the breathless and rapt: that God made us to appreciate beauty, to treasure love, and to celebrate the union of a man and a woman in marriage. (All those &ldquo;bride of Christ&rdquo; statements in the New Testament only work because of the metaphor, folks.)</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s give it a rest, friends. Rejoice with those who rejoice. Celebrate love and beauty. But keep your feet firmly grounded in the truth of who you are and who God is making you. It&rsquo;s also OK to keep your mouth shut sometimes. God doesn&rsquo;t award merit badges for cynicism.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2011/04/21/some-thoughts-on.html">Some thoughts on the proposed new mission statement for Stonebridge</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2011/04/21/some-thoughts-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2011-04-21 14:20:11 -0500">Apr 21, 2011</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A couple of weeks ago Becky and I attended a Friday night meeting at church where the church leadership discussed their notional new mission statement for the church. While this statement is still a draft, and has yet to be presented to the full congregation, with the pastors' permission I want to explore the new statement in some detail and explain why I&rsquo;m very much in favor of it.</p>
<p>First, the statement:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The mission of Stonebridge Church is to walk alongside each person we meet as they take their next step with Jesus.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some key phrases.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;to walk alongside&rdquo;</strong>. I am more and more convinced that this is the posture that we as Christians should take with all those that we encounter. We are not enemies in opposition of those who don&rsquo;t believe the way we do; we are not self-righteous, hypocritical mockers of those whose sin is more obvious; we are not insulated saints who retreat to the comfortable hidey-hole where everything is &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. Instead, we are right there <em>alongside</em> people, where they are. We have an arm around their shoulders and we are speaking words of love and encouragement. We need to be alongside both the lost and the found, among the rebellious and the repentant alike.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;each person we meet&rdquo;</strong>. This phrase reminds us that our calling isn&rsquo;t limited to the church but is as expansive as each person that God places in our path. The heart of the believer is to be outwardly-focused, and a heart filled with the love of God will overflow into each one they meet.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;as they take their next step&rdquo;</strong>. This recognizes that all of us, believers or not, are still in progress, taking one step at a time. It reminds us to be gracious with each person we encounter, because they are on a journey just like we are, even if they&rsquo;re at a different point. And it reinforces the message of <a href="http://esv.to/1Co3.5-8">1 Corinthians 3:5 - 8</a>: that we may each play a different role in God&rsquo;s work to bring someone to Himself. Whether we plant the seed or water the seed or see the seed blossom into flower, it is God providing the growth, and we are reminded not to be discouraged if our work doesn&rsquo;t create instant results.</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;with Jesus.&quot;</strong> And this brings us back to the ultimate object of our lives in service to others: to bring them to, and encourage them with, Jesus. Whatever work God calls us to do, it is done out of love for Jesus, in the name of Jesus, and for the glory of Jesus. Whether you are serving on the stage or behind the scenes, publicly proclaiming Christ in the midst of a crowd or quietly sharing with a friend or co-worker, working for justice in a far-off country or just caring for the weak and needy person on your street, you do it for Jesus. God has given diverse roles and functions, but puts us all together in one body, and says that it is the body of Christ (<a href="http://www.esvonline.org/search/1+cor+12/">1 Cor 12</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like this mission statement does a good job of capturing the essential direction of ministry that we&rsquo;re already on at Stonebridge, and I hope that as it is further refined and rolled out it will encourage each of us to be constantly mindful of being alongside those that we encounter every day.</p>

			 <p>This seems to be the story of my music-listening life: catching up with albums years after they are released, and only eventually having them resonate with me  . Sure, there are a few records that have immediately grabbed me and then stayed at the top of my favorites list for years. But often it takes time for the music or the particular sound to grow on me. For instance:</p>
<p><strong>Coldplay</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rush-Blood-Head-Coldplay/dp/B000069AUI%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000069AUI"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/80ef0fa795.jpg" alt=""></a>My brother Ryan was first trying to get me to listen to Coldplay&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S58428/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000S58428">A Rush Of Blood to the Head</a></em> within the first year after it was released. He&rsquo;s always been the Brit Rock guy, after all, and I&rsquo;ve been the slow-to-adopt older brother. I remember giving it a first listen and thinking that I wasn&rsquo;t fond of it at all. A couple of years later, though, they started to make sense. And without diving into the argument of whether Coldplay&rsquo;s older stuff is better or the newer stuff is better, let me just sum up their popularity in my household now by saying that whenever Laura requests a song while we&rsquo;re driving, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shiver&rdquo; (from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXLL8O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000SXLL8O">Parachutes</a></em>), but that if Addie requests a song, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strawberry Swing&rdquo; (from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AU8ZLK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AU8ZLK">Viva la Vida</a></em>). I guess we&rsquo;ve covered the full spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Radiohead</strong></p>
<p>I never did get Radiohead. I remember downloading <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011TQLA2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0011TQLA2">In Rainbows</a></em> when the band first offered it for free, listening to it once, and not getting it at all. Then one day a couple of years ago I turned it back on, and BAM!, it made sense. Now I&rsquo;ve gone back and gained appreciation for <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019R7XXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0019R7XXU">Kid A</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TERK3C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TERK3C">The Bends</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TENE6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000TENE6Y">OK Computer</a></em>, too. (I&rsquo;m working on <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXOK0A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000SXOK0A">Hail to the Thief</a></em>&hellip; maybe someday I&rsquo;ll figure it out.)</p>
<p><strong>Jazz</strong></p>
<p>Sure, that&rsquo;s a big topic. Didn&rsquo;t listen to a lot of jazz growing up, but in high school somebody gave me a copy of Harry Connick Jr.&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136NV4C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00136NV4C"><em>When Harry Met Sally</em> soundtrack</a>. (<em>That</em> was one of those albums that immediately grabbed me and never let go.) So sure, I liked Harry&rsquo;s big band. But more modern jazz still left me cold. Then one day I picked up Miles Davis' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136JQMI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00136JQMI">Kind of Blue</a></em>. (Come to think of it, I think Ryan pointed me to that one, too.) Classic jazz album. Had me hooked.</p>
<p>Then one day somebody mentioned that if I liked Harry Connick, I might like Thelonious Monk. I&rsquo;d never heard any Monk before, but listening to some album previews&hellip; the guy was amazing! And yeah, it was obvious that Harry had picked up some things from him. And Monk led to Coltrane. Coltrane led to Charlie Parker. I think I&rsquo;ve sort of hit my limit with Ornette Coleman&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048ZLH1Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0048ZLH1Y">The Shape of Jazz to Come</a></em>. I sort of get it, but it doesn&rsquo;t grab me or leave me wanting more. Maybe someday it&rsquo;ll click, too, and I&rsquo;ll move on to the more modern jazz.</p>
<p>Let us now return to where we started this post:</p>
<p><strong>Stravinsky</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c2a12e62c7.jpg" alt="">I vaguely remember trying to listen to Stravinsky back 10 years ago, and thinking that his stuff was a cacophonous mess. Didn&rsquo;t get it at all. But for some reason I picked up a CD at the library last week of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B7F0W4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001B7F0W4">Stravinsky symphonies</a>, and, lo and behold, it&rsquo;s brilliant! I think it took me progressing through Philip Glass and Steve Reich and Sufjan Stevens' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S3HZXM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002S3HZXM">The BQE</a></em> to get me ready for it.</p>
<p>Have you had a similar experience with a band or type of music?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2011/03/29/a-first-look.html">A first look at Amazon Cloud Drive and Amazon Cloud Player</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Amazon is offering two new services this morning: Amazon Cloud Drive and Amazon Cloud Player. Time to take a quick look at what they&rsquo;re offering. The front page on Amazon.com gives the basic details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloud Player comes in two varieties: Web and Android. All you need is a computer with a web browser and you can listen to your music with Cloud Player for Web - no software to install - just a web browser. The Android version is an app that lets you do the same thing from your Android phone or tablet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, about the pricing: Amazon Cloud Drive is a freemium service - free for the first 5 GB of storage, with paid plans above that. The pricing structure is straightforward: $1 / GB / year, with plans at 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 GB. The pricing chart tells us that each plan &ldquo;holds up to&rdquo; not only X number of songs but also X number of photos or X minutes of HD video, so Amazon is pitching this service as a real Cloud Drive (backup service?), good for storing more than just music. In addition, any purchases from AmazonMP3 don&rsquo;t count against your storage space, and if you purchase from the AmazonMP3 store in any time in 2011 they&rsquo;ll give you the 20GB plan for free for one year.</p>
<p>Setting up the Cloud Drive couldn&rsquo;t be easier; I purchased a $5 album from the MP3 store (Eisley&rsquo;s <em>The Valley</em>) and then I had the option to either download via the Amazon MP3 downloader or to store to the cloud drive. With one click it had kicked my tracks over into the Cloud Drive and opened up the player.</p>
<p>Cloud Player (web version) is a fairly basic music player design; there&rsquo;s an Album view where you can select a full album to play; you can also create playlists, download, or delete the tracks. Playback starts quickly and there&rsquo;s a QR code right on the player that you can scan with your phone to download the Android app.</p>
<p>OK, so next you want to upload some music from your existing collection. Click on the &ldquo;Upload to your Cloud Drive&rdquo; button and a prompt comes up telling you that you need to download the Amazon MP3 Uploader application (why include MP3 in the title?), which is a (platform neutral) Adobe Air app. Install the app and point it to your music library and it will scan for all the supported types that you could upload.</p>
<p>Yes, there are some unsupported music types. At the moment, it&rsquo;ll only support MP3 and M4A files, and (obviously) won&rsquo;t support anything you bought from iTMS that&rsquo;s wrapped with DRM. It defaults to assuming you want to upload everything in your library, and it gives you an estimated time to upload. (For my 74 GB of music library, it estimates 42 hours and change.)</p>
<p>Minor gripe with the uploader: rather than just showing you the entire directory tree and allowing you to select the pieces you want to upload, it flattens it and shows you an alphabetized list of lowest-level folders. This is a major pain. Now if I want to upload my entire, say, Sufjan Stevens collection, I can&rsquo;t just click on the Sufjan top-level folder; I have to scroll through the list and select The Age of Adz, The BQE, Illinois, Seven Swans, etc. Amazon, fix this in the next version, please?</p>
<p>Otherwise, the uploader seems to do its thing well enough. It tells you how much storage you&rsquo;re going to use with your uploads, how much you have left available on your Cloud Drive, and there&rsquo;s the ever-present link to Buy Additional Storage.</p>
<p>Once the upload was going I fired up my Samsung Galaxy phone, scanned that QR code, and downloaded the Amazon Cloud Player app. No big surprise here: Amazon is going for integration. The Android Cloud Player app is an update to the existing Amazon MP3 store app. This brings it awfully close to being to Android what the iTunes Music Store is to the iPhone; you can browse the store, make a purchase, start listening immediately. But Amazon does one better and lets you access your stuff in the cloud.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing with the Amazon Cloud Player some more; it looks pretty slick at first glance. The first screen gives you the option of browsing the Amazon MP3 store, browsing/playing on-device music, or browsing/playing/downloading music from your Cloud Drive. It recognized all of the music I already had loaded on my phone just fine. You&rsquo;re able to browse the stuff that you have on the Cloud Drive and either stream it for immediate play or download it to your phone for playback later. The download will run in the background while you do other things. (Wonder when they&rsquo;re gonna have the Amazon App Store do that? It can&rsquo;t be long now.) There are settings so you can restrict downloads to wifi-only if you want to conserve your phone&rsquo;s data plan.</p>
<p>Actual music playback is pretty straightforward, and the player part of the app looks nice and is easy to use. (Dang, I wish there was an easy way to take screenshots on my Android phone. The &ldquo;hold down back and press home&rdquo; thing that Google turns up doesn&rsquo;t seem to work for me.) Don&rsquo;t know if the player will replace DoubleTwist as my go-to music player; guess we&rsquo;ll have to see.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll take some time to see if the cloud storage thing is a big enough deal for me to want to pay to store my entire collection, but for now, at first look, it&rsquo;s clear that Amazon got a lot of things right on the first try.</p>

			 <p>So I have this sudden inclination to find some new games to play as a family. I don&rsquo;t have a long history as a gamer or anything; I played a little bit of Risk and Axis and Allies as a high-schooler, but that&rsquo;s about it. Becky and I play chess every once in a long while, but she&rsquo;s established a history of being able to beat me in chess at will, so it&rsquo;s less entertaining (for me, at least) than it could be. There are a few games at which we&rsquo;re more or less even; Boggle and cribbage come to mind.</p>
<p>So there it is. We&rsquo;re boring when it comes to games. Our kids aren&rsquo;t quite old enough to be included in the games yet, so that makes things a bit more of a challenge. But it still seems like we should expand our horizons a little.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve perused the shelves at Walmart and Target, and frankly there&rsquo;s not much there that interests me. Most of them are either re-releases of Milton Bradley staples (yet another version of Monopoly!) or games that require or encourage vast amounts of pop culture knowledge. Even a game like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112CHCK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00112CHCK">Apples To Apples</a> (which I&rsquo;ve played before and enjoyed) requires a level of pop culture knowledge that escapes most kids and some adults.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some of my nerdy friends about other games that might qualify as good strategy games that pique my interest. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7JWUA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000W7JWUA">Settlers of Catan</a> seems to be the archetype; I&rsquo;ve also heard good things about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UNAX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00005UNAX">Carcassonne</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JQY6K4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chrishubbs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JQY6K4">Dominion</a>. I&rsquo;ve got two basic parameters for selecting a new game: it needs to be something that can be played two-player, and it needs to be something that a bright child of 7 or 8 could conceivably learn and enjoy.</p>
<p>So, friends and gamers, what say you? Can you make any game recommendations for a family that needs to move out of the Milton Bradley era?</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/b41d470d3c.jpg" alt="">I&rsquo;ve been doing a slow-and-steady re-read of <a href="http://www.introvertedchurch.com/">Adam McHugh&rsquo;s</a> <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introverts-Church-Finding-Extroverted-Culture/dp/0830837027%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0830837027">Introverts in the Church</a></em>, and words don&rsquo;t well express how much I resonate with what he is saying. Just as I read Dilbert and think that Scott Adams must&rsquo;ve worked where I work to get it <em>that</em> right, I read McHugh and think he must&rsquo;ve served in the same churches I&rsquo;ve served in. Amazing.</p>
<p>Last night I got to chapter 5, &ldquo;Introverted Community and Relationships&rdquo;, and found a few paragraphs that were so apt that I couldn&rsquo;t resist sharing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As introverts seek to enter into and participate in particular communities, their trajectory of commitment may take a different shape than that of their extroverted counterparts. extroverts, who want to increase their level of involvement, may proceed roughly in a straight line as they move from the periphery into the nucleus of the community. &hellip; The journey of introverts into a community, however, is <strong>better conceptualized as a spiral.</strong> They take steps into a community, but then spiral out of it in order to regain energy, to reflect on their experiences and to determine if they are comfortable in that community. They move between entry, retreat and reentry, gradually moving deeper into the community on each loop.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The introverted path into community, much to the confusion of many extroverts, never reaches a point in which the spiraling form is shed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know how it feels when someone puts words to something that you&rsquo;ve always felt and experienced but haven&rsquo;t been able to describe? That&rsquo;s how I feel when reading that passage. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> what my pattern has been, or has needed to be, for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Some more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An introverted college student I worked with&hellip;encountered several reactions when he chose to step outside of his community after two years of consistent participation. <strong>Extroverted leaders chided him for his lack of commitment and were convinced that his pulling back was indicative of a larger spiritual problem infecting his heart.</strong> The pastor of the community arranged meetings with him to understand what was happening and what was the source of his dissatisfaction with the group. <strong>These efforts, as well intentioned as they were, only pushed him further away instead of drawing him back into his previous level of commitment.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;ve been there. And I&rsquo;m thankful to be in a place now where that isn&rsquo;t happening.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of books the past few years. As <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80101-chris-hubbs">my Goodreads account</a> will attest, I&rsquo;ve averaged a book every 5 - 6 days for the past four years, and to date in 2011 I&rsquo;m still on that pace. The book pile next to my bed waxes and wanes with library visits and Amazon shipments. I&rsquo;ve always been a quick reader. This can be a beneficial thing at times, but it also means that sometimes I&rsquo;m still picking up detail on my second and third times through a book. I&rsquo;m coming to the conclusion now, though, that I need to slow down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a number of books over the last few years that have, at the time, stuck out to me as being particularly insightful and helpful to me thinking. (Wright&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Hope-Rethinking-Resurrection-Mission/dp/0061551821%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0061551821">Surprised by Hope</a></em>, Capon&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Between-Noon-Three-Romance-Outrage/dp/0802842224%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dchrishubbs-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0802842224">Between Noon and Three</a></em>, and McHugh&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introverts-Church-Finding-Extroverted-Culture/dp/0830837027%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0830837027">Introverts in the Church</a></em> quickly come to mind in this category.) But with the exception of <em>Surprised by Hope</em> (which I read through multiple times, underlined extensively, and <a href="http://chrishubbs.com/2008/03/06/wrestling-with-tom-an-american-evangelicals-coming-to-grips-with-n-t-wrights-surprised-by-hope/">attempted to blog</a>), the other books I read quickly, went &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s good stuff&rdquo;, and then put them down.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to me, but it holds more impact when written down in black and white: the value I get from reading the book is in direct proportion to the amount of time I&rsquo;m willing to devote to digging in to it.</p>
<p>So, I want to slow down. I want to cut down on the number of frivolous novels I read, and focus in on the valuable stuff. I want to take books a chapter or two at a time, chew on the thoughts, and fill up a Moleskine making notes on them afterwards. I want to use this blog as a place to wrestle with and promote the good stuff I find in those books. I want this exercise to sharpen my thinking, hone my writing, and draw me closer to Christ. By His grace may it be so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

			 <p>We took the family to Texas Roadhouse this week for my birthday, and I was quickly annoyed by the overblown descriptions that the restaurant apparently requires their servers to use when describing the food. After the third time our waitress asked what we&rsquo;d like for a &ldquo;hand-made side&rdquo;, I was tempted to ask her if I could have a machine-made, out-of-a-box side instead. After hearing several other servers use the same line, though, I was glad I bit my tongue. It&rsquo;s not their fault that their employer forces them to use silly scripts.</p>
<p>In the spirit of fairness, though, I wanted to provide my evaluation and accuracy rating on the four primary annoying phrases I heard throughout the night. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Fresh-baked rolls&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>OK, this one is really hard to argue with. The rolls really are fresh-baked there in the restaurant. At busy times we&rsquo;ve occasionally had to wait for a fresh batch to come out of the oven. And they&rsquo;re yummy. So while it gets annoying to hear &ldquo;fresh-baked rolls&rdquo; multiple times a night when just &ldquo;rolls&rdquo; would do, I can&rsquo;t ding them on the correctness of their description.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy Rating: Four Stars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Hand-made sides&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve given themselves some wiggle room on this one, because you can define &ldquo;hand-made&rdquo; pretty loosely. Take the prepared lettuce mix out of the plastic bag with your hand, sprinkle some pre-grated cheese and some out-of-a-box croutons on top and voila! a hand-made salad. And I&rsquo;m guessing they didn&rsquo;t hand-cut the potatoes to make my steak fries. I guess if they want to define &ldquo;hand-made&rdquo; that way, fine&hellip; but I&rsquo;m not buying it. (Well, I did buy it. And eat it. But I&rsquo;d balk at calling them hand-made&hellip; OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy Rating: 2 stars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Ice-cold beer&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;ve never had a beer at Texas Roadhouse, so I don&rsquo;t have first-hand knowledge of the beer temperature. However, I consulted RateBeer.com&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/Story.asp?StoryID=479">helpful article about the correct temperature at which to serve beer</a>, and they gave this advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Very cold (0-4C/32-39F):</strong> Any beer you don’t actually want to taste.<br>
<strong>Cold (4-7C/39-45F):</strong> Hefeweizen, Premium Lager, Pilsner&hellip;<br>
<strong>Cool (8-12C/45-54F):</strong> American Pale Ale, Amber Ale&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Per those standards, if Texas Roadhouse beer is actually ice-cold, apparently it&rsquo;s a beer that you don&rsquo;t want to taste. Eesh. So, either their descriptive phrase is highly inaccurate or their beer is rubbish.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy Rating: 1 star.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Legendary margaritas&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/legend">Dictionary.com defines <em>legend</em></a> as &ldquo;a nonhistorical or unverifiable story handed down by tradition from earlier times and popularly accepted as historical.&rdquo; So, if Texas Roadhouse&rsquo;s margaritas' quality is &ldquo;legendary&rdquo;, apparently the message is that the quality of said margaritas is either &ldquo;nonhistorical&rdquo; (i.e. untrue) or &ldquo;unverifiable&rdquo; (perhaps that means you can&rsquo;t actually order one?). However, apparently people have passed down stories about them which have been accepted as fact.</p>
<p>The thing is, in my many visits to Texas Roadhouse, I cannot recall ever seeing anybody actually drink a margarita. Maybe this lines up with the idea that the quality of the margaritas is &ldquo;unverifiable&rdquo;? I primarily see margaritas consumed at the local Mexican restaurant, but at Texas Roadhouse if people are drinking alcohol they&rsquo;re usually drinking beer.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy rating: 3 stars</strong>, primarily because I&rsquo;m starting to buy into that &ldquo;unverifiable&rdquo; bit of <em>legendary</em>.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever read a book that turned everything you had been taught about a subject upside down? That&rsquo;s where I feel I&rsquo;m at on the topic of cross-gender friendships after reading Dan Brennan&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703">Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions</a></em>.</p>
<p>Growing up in the evangelical church, what I&rsquo;ve been taught about friendships between men and women goes something like this: be careful. Stay away (mostly). Male-female relationships mostly just lead to sex. Once you&rsquo;re old enough to marry, find that right person. That person then needs to be your best, closest friend, and only cross-gender close friend for the rest of your life. Beware of spending time with people of the opposite sex for fear of damaging your reputation. (Because after all, if a man and a woman develop any sort of a relationship, it&rsquo;s going to lead to sex.) Take a step even further back and make sure you don&rsquo;t even do much serious communicating with those of the opposite sex because you might venture into &ldquo;emotional infidelity&rdquo; to your spouse.</p>
<p>But wait, you say, there is truth in these things. Marital unfaithfulness is, sadly, not too uncommon in the church. And when it happens, it&rsquo;s devastating to men, women, children, families. I know this. As a church leader I&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the damage that can be caused. But I resonate with Dan Brennan when he says that the evangelical church has gone the (sadly) usual route of putting up legalistic barriers &ldquo;for protection&rdquo; rather than taking down the walls and allowing for the possibility that good things could run wild. This idea that male-female relationships inevitably end in sex is something we&rsquo;ve gotten from Sigmund Freud, not from God. Why can&rsquo;t we wait to let <a href="http://esv.to/Ga3.28">Galatians 3:28</a> soak in (&ldquo;here is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;) before immediately saying &ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo;?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/c998b9d7bf.jpg" alt=""></a>Brennan persuasively argues that, pre-Freud, it was not uncommon for the language of friendship (both in same-gender and cross-gender friendships) to be personal and intimate in ways that make our modern minds squirm with Freud-inferred sexual tension. Yet, Brennan says, these friendships often chastely existed, and indeed co-existed alongside the healthy marriages of one or both of the friends. He quotes liberally from the early and medieval church, and cites three Biblical examples: David and Jonathan, Ruth and Naomi, and Jesus and Mary Magdalene. In each case these relationships were intense, deep, intimate friendships; and yet in each case, no matter what Freud would tell us, these friendships were good and right and appropriate. While Brennan is arguing at times based on what he (reasonably) infers from the text, I believe the burden of proof is on those who would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this type of relationships rather than on he who is saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If I had one gripe with <em>Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions</em> while reading, it was that I wanted more practical advice or examples of what these friendships would look like when worked out in real life. Brennan provides some examples from his own cross-gender friendships; he touches briefly on things like prayer and conversation, recreation, and physical affection. But as I reflect on it, I realize I&rsquo;m thinking wrongly about it. I don&rsquo;t really need a book to tell me what friendships should look like. But though I agreed with Brennan that we&rsquo;ve set legalistic fences in the wrong places, in expecting more concrete examples what I was really asking was &ldquo;OK, where do we move the fences to?&rdquo;. And if that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m asking, I&rsquo;ve missed Brennan&rsquo;s point. He&rsquo;s saying, instead, &ldquo;take down the fences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the church is really ready to deal with Dan Brennan&rsquo;s book. His ideas require buy-in from a lot of people if they are going to work. And yet, if the church were to truly buy into it, we would be a powerful example to the world of how God&rsquo;s redemptive work truly makes all things new&hellip; even relationships between men and women.</p>
<p><em>Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions</em> is worth reading and chewing on for a while. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703">get it from Amazon</a>.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;aren&rsquo;t necessarily what you think. My left ankle and leg has been very sore for the last two days. Why? Because I had an hour of music practice on Saturday, followed by an hour of practice and then two church services on Sunday morning. And because I play the keyboard while standing up, and I pedal with the right foot, which means I end up doing a lot of standing and flexing on my left leg.</p>
<p>Do they have special workouts so I can prepare better for this type of strain? This is not the way I thought a commitment to playing in the worship band would wear me down.</p>

			 <p>My reading queue has been backed up for a while now, and I&rsquo;ll admit that I only make things worse by buying books and regularly hitting the library. I&rsquo;ve been entertaining myself with some light popular spy thrillers lately, but it&rsquo;s time to put those down and work through some better stuff. Here are a few that are in my pile:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703">Sacred Unions, Sacred Passions: Engaging the Mystery of Friendship Between Men and Women</a> by Dan Brennan. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Unions-Passions-Engaging-Friendship/dp/0982580703%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0982580703"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/69a6ae1555.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I had this one on my Amazon wishlist for a while after <a href="http://johnharmstrong.typepad.com/john_h_armstrong_/2010/12/sacred-unions-sacred-passions-engaging-the-mystery-of-friendship-between-men-and-women.html">John Armstrong wrote about it</a>. Becky bought it for me for Valentine&rsquo;s Day and it&rsquo;s been sitting in the pile ever since. The author&rsquo;s premise is that there is a meaningful place in the Christian life for close friendships between members of the opposite sex who are not married to each other. Typically this has been something that Christians have advised against, usually on the basis of wanting to protect marriage&hellip; but I&rsquo;m interested in what the author has to say.</p>

<p>I got this one for Christmas and have already read it once, but it really merits a re-read and perhaps a blog post or two or three.

<p>I don&rsquo;t even remember what blog I was reading that recommended this sci-fi novel, but the review was good, and the summary looked good, and the library had it&hellip; so it&rsquo;s in my queue. I do love me some sci-fi.</p>

<p>This goes into the re-read category as well. I read things too quickly sometimes, and this was one that I buzzed through on the way to some other book. It deserves a more thoughtful re-read; there&rsquo;s a lot in it that could be very helpful to me and other introverts out there.</p>
<p>Well, enough for now. Any recommendations on other books I should add to the queue?</p>

			 <p>I could tell you exactly the point I was going to choke up even the day before. I had been hanging out at worship team practice, saw that this song was on the roster for Sunday, and knew that when we hit the middle of the second verse I was going to have tears on my face and a lump in my throat. Here are the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on<br>
A glorious light beyond all compare<br>
And there will be an end to these troubles<br>
But until that day comes We’ll live to know You here on the earth<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And I will fear no evil<br>
For my God is with me<br>
And if my God is with me<br>
Whom then shall I fear?<br>
Whom then shall I fear?
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<em>-- &ldquo;You Never Let Go&rdquo;, by Matt Redman</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, when we do that song and I&rsquo;m playing keys in the worship band, I can hold it together. But when I&rsquo;m in the congregation, and I see the faces of my brothers and sisters singing and playing, and know the stories behind those faces, I just about can&rsquo;t take it. There&rsquo;s the woman who&rsquo;s wrestled with difficult family issues for her whole life and who is just finding freedom. There&rsquo;s the man who is dealing with layoffs at work. There&rsquo;s the woman who has chosen to stay married to a man who will be in prison for the next decade. There&rsquo;s the guy who&rsquo;s dealing with children with substance abuse issues. When we sing with hope about the &ldquo;end of these troubles&rdquo;, these people know something about troubles. And yet they sing with a hope and joy that is unquenchable. That&rsquo;s not natural. That comes from God.</p>
<p>As soon as I get past that, the pre-chorus comes and smacks me in the face - precisely because I <em>am</em> so often a fearful man. And I&rsquo;m not even sure that I&rsquo;m so afraid of &ldquo;evil&rdquo; - probably because I don&rsquo;t encounter it so much. But too often I have either this unnecessary fear of other people, of what they will think and whether or not I&rsquo;ll look stupid in front of them. And too often I have fears about the future, about my family and providing for them, fears that display my need to trust more fully in God and to turn my worries and fears over to Him. So when I sing the words &ldquo;If my God is with me, whom then shall I fear?&rdquo;, the Holy Spirit is preaching right into my heart in the way I need it most.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaredcwilson.com">Jared Wilson</a> had a tweet months ago that stuck with me - wish I could find it to link to it directly, but I&rsquo;ll have to paraphrase. He asked: <em>Why are we so afraid? Jesus is comfortable and confident walking on the streets of the town, because He&rsquo;s the king.</em> As representatives of the king, we should walk with that same confidence. Dear God, let it be so.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve used this space in the past to gripe about bad service, so when truly good service comes my way, it seems prudent to write it up here, too.</p>
<p>The week before Christmas (December 20, to be precise) my wife and I took advantage of our long-expired Verizon contract and a sweet deal from US Cellular (&lsquo;USC&rsquo; hereafter) and made the switch to become USC customers. I took a long lunch on a snowy Monday afternoon and we headed over to the location nearest our house to get hooked up. US Cellular was offering &ldquo;any phone free after rebate&rdquo; and service credits for switching lines from a competitor over to USC.</p>
<p>We had our eye on the Samsung Mesmerize (the USC version of the Galaxy S), but when we made it in to the store, they were already sold out. They called around and told us that there were a few left at the store across town, but the wait time there was almost 2 hours. Besides, the saleswoman told us, the HTC Desire is also a good phone, and you have a 30-day window where if you&rsquo;re not happy, you can switch, and you just have to pay the difference in price between the phones. This seemed reasonable to me. The Desire was normally $230, the Mesmerize, $280, so if I didn&rsquo;t like the Desire, I wait until they come back in stock, pay the $50 upper, and still get the phone I want. Sold.</p>
<p>Three weeks later we were less than happy with the Desires. (That&rsquo;s fodder for another blog post, I suppose.) So, once USC got the Mesmerizes back in stock, I went down to the store and asked about the upgrade. Sure, they&rsquo;d be happy to help me switch. I only had to pay the difference in price. Then the saleswoman (a different one from when we bought the phones in the first place) told me that the difference I&rsquo;d have to pay was <strong>$200</strong>.</p>
<p>I was stunned. $200? How did they arrive on that number? Well, she told me, you paid $80 for the Desire originally. Now, the current price on the Mesmerize is $280. So, you have to pay the difference between the two, which is $200. I told her that it hadn&rsquo;t been represented to me that way, but she just gave me a fake-sympathy smile face and said sorry, but it&rsquo;d be $200.</p>
<p>I suppose I should&rsquo;ve stopped to ask for a manager right there and then, but I&rsquo;m lousy with that sort of confrontation. So, I paid the $200, got the new phone, and went home to consider my strategy. (Step 1: figure out how to keep my wife from killing me for paying $200 for a new phone.) Shortly thereafter, made my first complaint via Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switched my phone from the Desire to the Mesmerize. Love the phone, very unhappy with @<a href="http://twitter.com/uscellular">uscellular</a>. Emailing customer service now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly thereafter I did a quick check and realized that US Cellular somehow doesn&rsquo;t have an official Twitter account. They&rsquo;ve done the Facebook thing (badly, IMO), but they have no official customer service representation on Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hmmm, looks like USCellular doesn&rsquo;t do Twitter. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to complain through other social channels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I went off to the uscellular.com website. I wrote up a few paragraphs to explain that I was an unhappy new US Cellular customer, concisely describe the issue, and explain what I thought a fair resolution would be. I&rsquo;ll publish the thing here in its entirety. Feel free to skip it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear sirs, My name is Chris Hubbs, and I am a new US Cellular customer. My cell phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. My wife and I switched two lines of service from Verizon on December 20, 2010, and added a data plan for both lines.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
At the time of purchasing the phones, the Samsung Mesmerize (the phone we wanted to buy) was out of stock at the Cedar Rapids River Run store. Our sales associate called around to the other Cedar Rapids stores and let us know that there were just a few left in stock, and that the wait time at the other stores was almost 2 hours. She also assured us that we had a 30-day window to switch phones, and that we would simply need to &ldquo;pay the difference in price&rdquo; between the two phones. Since the posted price for the phones was $199 (with contract and data plan) for the Mesmerize and $149 (with contract and data plan) for the HTC Desire, we ended up going with two Desires, and concluded that the $50 per phone difference would be reasonable if we wanted to switch once the Mesmerize was back in stock.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Today when I went back to the River Run location to switch my line to the Mesmerize, I was told that rather than the $50 difference between the two phones, I was required to pay $200 to switch - the difference between the $80 promotional price I paid on December 20 and the full price of the Mesmerize. This was, to say the least, a shock. This was clearly not the &ldquo;difference in price&rdquo; between the two phones. The difference in the posted price between the Mesmerize and the Desire continues to be $50. While I went ahead and paid to get the phone today, I firmly believe that the upgrade price should have been only $50, not $200.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
At $200 to upgrade, my wife, who was quite looking forward to switching to the Mesmerize, will not be able to afford the upgrade of her phone, and we are both left quite disappointed with US Cellular while not even into our first month of service. To set things right with our account, I am asking that you credit my account $150 (the difference between the $200 I paid and the $50 I should have paid) and then allow my wife to switch to the Mesmerize for that same $50. Those actions would fulfill the understanding that we were given when we originally signed our contract, and would restore some confidence in US Cellular&rsquo;s reputation.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Kind regards, Chris Hubbs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not seeing a lot of other options, I sent the note off to USC via their online form, and sat, less than hopeful, for a response.</p>
<p>Within 30 minutes, I had an email from <a href="http://twitter.com/SharifRenno">Sharif Renno</a>, who is a US Ceullar store manager in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. He had no connection with my form submittal, but he had seen my complaint on Twitter, had followed my Twitter account back to my blog, found my email address, and contacted me directly to see if he could help. I sent him a copy of my complaint email and expressed my appreciation for his help. Then I headed off to play rec league basketball and missed a voice mail from him just a couple of hours later. He told me that he thought he had a solution worked out, but that he was working with a manager somewhere in Iowa, and that the other manager would contact me in the morning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kudos to to US Cellular manager @<a href="http://twitter.com/SharifRenno">SharifRenno</a> who saw my tweet and took the initiative to pass my contact info along to someone who can help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That next morning I got a call from Matt Murray, who manages a USC store in Marshalltown, Iowa - still 90 minutes' drive from my house. Matt outlined a solution that would end up with me getting exactly what I asked for - the two Mesmerize upgrades for $50 each, per my original expectation. He apologized for the confusion and made it clear that he wanted to do whatever was necessary to ensure I was happy with US Cellular. The solution was easy enough; I would go to a local store and upgrade the other phone (paying the $200), then he would log in and credit my account to make it come out right.</p>
<p>One trip to a USC store, one email back to Matt, and 24 hours later, he had done just as he promised. My account had been credited, we had the phones we wanted, and our initial impression of US Cellular had gone from lousy to excellent. I asked both Matt and Sharif for their supervisors' contact info, and immediately sent glowing notes of commendation for each of them. I hope their supervisors pay attention. These are clearly guys who take customer service seriously.</p>
<p>So, chalk this one up as a win for social media. Not that US Cellular corporate handles it very well. (I finally got an email response back from my web form submittal about a week later: &ldquo;It looks like this situation has already been handled&hellip;&quot;) It&rsquo;s sad that they totally miss that social media path. Big kudos go to Sharif and others like him who take it upon themselves to keep an eye on Twitter for mentions of their company, and who then take the initiative to serve customers whether those customers live near them or not.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When our oldest daughter turned 6 and we finally <em>had</em> to make a decision about school, we decided we&rsquo;d try our hand at homeschooling. She was already ahead of the game in many academic areas, our local elementary school is, sadly, near the bottom of the heap for Iowa elementary schools, and, frankly, I didn&rsquo;t see a lot of value that could come from sending her off to school for seven hours a day every day, so it was a fairly easy decision. (I should say it seemed easy for me - my wife may have wrestled with it more, though to my perspective it was more trepidation on her part than resistance.)</p>
<p>I have a bit of a history with homeschooling; I attended a public kindergarten (well, two of them, actually, since we moved mid-year), but after that I was homeschooled from first grade through twelfth. Homeschooling was not exactly legal in Nebraska when we started back in the early 80&rsquo;s; there was <a href="http://www.nchea.org/Historical">much legislative wrangling and several parents were in jail</a>. Even after the laws were changed, there was a strong defensive mindset that was pervasive in the homeschool community, and probably rightfully so. My memory of it now, 25 years later, is that we were afraid. Afraid of the school truant officer who might show up at our door. Afraid that having a kid running around in the backyard during the school day would prompt an anonymous tip from a neighbor to social services. Afraid that something, somewhere, would go wrong, and that we&rsquo;d be in legal limbo, with parents in trouble and kids in protective custody.</p>
<p>That feeling of fear was encouraged to an extent by those well-meaning organizations who were out there to help protect us. Organizations like the Home School Legal Defense Association did good, useful legal work; their newsletters, though, were full of horror stories of parents who&rsquo;d run into legal trouble with homeschooling, and it seemed that only the families that were HSLDA members had happy endings to their stories. There were pages of helpful tips on protecting your family (&ldquo;don&rsquo;t open the door if they knock! Only talk through the locked screen door or step out onto the porch!&quot;), and while they may have been useful to certain people in certain cases, to me they only seemed to add to the fear and to, of course, prompt us to renew our yearly membership in the protection plan.</p>
<p>Homeschoolers in those days, even through the late 80&rsquo;s - early 90&rsquo;s when I was a teenager, remained largely a fringe element. For every &ldquo;normal&rdquo; family who homeschooled, there were a half-dozen &ldquo;weird&rdquo; homeschoolers. Some parents were motivated to homeschool because they believed it was their God-given responsibility, and that they could do a better job than the public schools; some others, I&rsquo;m sure, just used the freedom to homeschool as an excuse to keep their kids under their thumb in whatever twisted home life they had. (I remember one homeschool family who kept their kitchen cabinets locked&hellip; to keep their teenaged children out of them. Yikes.) My family teetered on the edge of &ldquo;weird-homeschooler-ness&rdquo; from time to time; in retrospect I believe that dalliance was driven not by an attraction to the weirdness but simply by the desire to have fellowship with people who shared some key beliefs about family.</p>
<p>Since starting homeschooling this year we have been very pleasantly surprised at the amount of support we get from all directions. Neighbors and people we meet around town don&rsquo;t even blink when we say we&rsquo;re homeschooling. The homeschooling oversight (required by law in Iowa) is provided by a homeschool assistance program that is funded by state tax dollars and run out of the basement of a local elementary school. (That sentence right there is probably enough to make any 1980&rsquo;s homeschooling parent&rsquo;s head explode.) The teachers who provide the oversight are full-time dedicated to helping homeschooling parents succeed in educating their children. Our daughter &ldquo;goes to school&rdquo; for 5 hours, one day a week, to do science and art and music and be with friends. It&rsquo;s a really excellent arrangement all the way around.</p>
<p>The other pleasant homeschooling surprise has come as we&rsquo;ve been at our church for two years now. Come in on a Sunday and you likely won&rsquo;t see any families that stick out as obvious homeschoolers. But start visiting with folks and getting to know people and it seems like every time I turn around I find out that some other family is homeschooling. Sure, I knew about the one family, because their daughter goes to school on Mondays with our daughter. But that elder&rsquo;s family, with the high-school-aged kid who&rsquo;s always helping out somewhere? Yep, homeschoolers. The pastor with a couple of young kids? Homeschoolers. The family who keeps the kids' club organized on Wednesday nights? Yep, homeschoolers again.</p>
<p>And they all seem so <em>normal</em>. I don&rsquo;t want to go overboard on the value of &ldquo;seeming normal&rdquo;, because if it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we seem normal or not - we need to do it. But in this case it&rsquo;s such a blessing to have progressed over the past twenty-five years to the point where homeschooling your children is an accepted, normal, even encouraged thing to do. I can only pray that it remains so.</p>
<p>What we all, as homeschooling parents in 2010, should recognize, though, is the debt that we owe to my parents and the thousands like them from the previous generation who blazed the trails for us. It was their civil disobedience, their prayers, their legislative lobbying, and their steadfastness in homeschooling when it was definitely <strong>not</strong> normal that has enabled us to come to our current state of normalcy. Thank you, Dad and Mom.</p>
<p>Now, friends of my generation: let&rsquo;s take advantage of the opportunities we&rsquo;ve been given, and not mess this up.</p>

			 <p>A couple of nights ago I had the classic Veggie Tales' Silly Song <em>Dance of the Cucumber</em> pop into my head. (Don&rsquo;t even bother asking why.)</p>
<p>And after reciting a few lines, I had a wild idea pop into my head. Imagine if <em>Dance of the Cucumber</em>, instead of being interpreted by Bob the Tomato, were interpreted by&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; William Shatner.</p>
<p>Imagine his trademark delivery of the classic lines:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch the cucumber&hellip; oh, how smooth his motion&hellip; like butter&hellip; on a bald&hellip; &hellip;monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the cucumber&hellip; hear his strong voice&hellip; like a lion.. &hellip;about to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the closing line of the verses: &ldquo;dancing cucumber&hellip; dancing cucumber&hellip; dancing cucumber&hellip; dance, dance&hellip; YEAH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;d be awesome. The more I think about it, I wonder if Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki didn&rsquo;t have Shatner in mind when they did the song&hellip; but I may just be humoring myself with that thought.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Back in August <a href="/10/08/the-perils-of-hipster-christianity/">I linked to a piece by Brett McCracken</a> wherein he decried what he sees as the evangelical temptation to &ldquo;be cool&rdquo; at the expense of real, genuine faith. My initial read resonated with the column, and I was a bit surprised when some folks I quite respect took issue with McCracken&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I haven&rsquo;t read the book, and absent a copy finding its way into my hands for free, I probably won&rsquo;t. However, I came upon an insightful review today that puts McCracken&rsquo;s book in a different (and much less favorable) light.</p>
<p>James K. A. Smith, <a href="http://www.theotherjournal.com/article.php?id=1034&amp;header=perspective">posting on TheOtherJournal.com</a>, says that McCracken needs to add the word &ldquo;poser&rdquo; to his lexicon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCracken’s analysis ends up being reductionistic: he thinks anyone who looks like a “hipster” is really just trying to be “cool.” This, I think, tells us more about Mr. McCracken than it does about so-called hipster Christianity&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
McCracken sets his sights on his own generation: hip millennials who are taken with incense, hemp clothing, Wendell Berry, and Amnesty International. McCracken is worried that this is just the next generation of cultural assimilation in the name of relevance.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But his analysis only works if, in fact, all hipsters are really just posers. That is, McCracken effectively reduces all hipsters to posers precisely because he can only imagine someone adopting such a lifestyle <em>in order to be cool</em>. Let me say it again: this tells us more about McCracken than it does about those young Christians who are spurning conservative, bourgeois values. [Emphasis in the original.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith acknowledges that there are, indeed, Christians who are trying to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;hipster&rdquo; simply for the sake of being cool, but he asserts that they are the &ldquo;posers&rdquo; and are not representative of the &ldquo;Christian hipsters&rdquo; he knows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In short, the lives of the Christian hipsters I know are a gazillion miles away from being worried about image or trendiness; they live the way they do because they are pursuing the good life characterized by well-ordered culture-making that is just and conducive to flourishing—and this requires resisting the mass-produced, mass-marketed, and mass-consumed banalities of the corporate ladder, the suburban veneer of so-called success, as well as the irresponsibility of perpetual adolescence that characterizes so many twentysomethings who imagine life as one big frat house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very much appreciate Smith&rsquo;s review and analysis and recommend it as worthwhile reading.</p>

<p>This was my introduction to big band. At the time I was a teenager who loved playing the piano, and here was a twenty-something artist who was ripping up the jazz piano and putting together some awesome big band arrangements. I fell in love with it, and I can sing all of the arrangements to this day.</p>
<p>2. Rich Mullins, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BJIFUQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001BJIFUQ">A Liturgy, A Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band</a></em></p>
<p>I had been a Rich Mullins fan before this record came out, but this is a classic, a nearly perfect record from beginning to end. Rich taught me that Christian music doesn&rsquo;t have to be low-quality, uninspired drivel, and my piano-playing style has been more influenced by his than by anyone else.</p>
<p>3. Jennifer Knapp, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C3N0BU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001C3N0BU">Kansas</a></em></p>
<p>Jen continued the &ldquo;Christian music doesn&rsquo;t have to suck&rdquo; campaign with her signature record. This one pushed me to pick up a guitar and sing. I&rsquo;ll never forget the morning that three of us from my worship team in college did &ldquo;Martyrs &amp; Thieves&rdquo; as a special&hellip; it was <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>4. USSR Ministry of Culture Chamber Choir, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001HC5?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000001HC5">Rachmaninoff: Vespers</a></em></p>
<p>I remember first hearing bits of <em>Vespers</em> on NPR as a pre-teen. As I recall, the program was comparing two recordings of this <em>a capella</em> choral work, one by the Robert Shaw Chorale and one by a Russian choir. The Robert Shaw group was technically perfect, but the Russian choir was so much more <em>alive</em>. When I finally bought a recording, I made sure to get a Russian choir. I own three recordings of <em>Vespers</em>, but this one is the best of the three.</p>
<p>5. Sergei Rachmaninoff, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000041WS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000041WS">The Ampico Piano Recordings</a></em></p>
<p>I first heard this in high school, and I was amazed both from the technical and musical perspectives. Rachmaninoff himself made these piano roll-type recordings back in the 1920&rsquo;s. Then in 1990 some engineers resurrected the rolls and the piano mechanism and made a modern recording on a good piano. The result is a clean, crisp recording of a master playing his own works. The highlight for me is the final track: Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s own arrangement of Fritz Kreisler&rsquo;s <em>Liebesfreud</em>.</p>
<p>6. Caedmon&rsquo;s Call, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00138H8Q2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00138H8Q2">Long Line of Leavers</a></em></p>
<p>My brother Ryan had been into Caedmon&rsquo;s for a long time but they never made sense to me. Then I popped this CD in at a Christian bookstore and was hooked within the first 10 seconds. Yeah, it&rsquo;s those horns on the first track that all true Caedmon&rsquo;s fans hate with a passion. But I loved them. From there on out I filled out my Caedmon&rsquo;s catalog. More significantly, I joined an online community of Caedmon&rsquo;s fans, which has over the past 6 years joined me up with some people who have become dear friends.</p>
<p>7. Coldplay, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S58428?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000S58428">A Rush of Blood to the Head</a></em></p>
<p>Ryan tried again with this one. It took a couple of years before it finally made sense, but once it clicked, it was amazing. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d count it as my favorite Coldplay record, and not sure that it contains my favorite Coldplay song, but it&rsquo;s a classic from beginning to end, and was my first Coldplay record.</p>
<p>8. Andrew Osenga, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZNS8UG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000ZNS8UG">The Morning</a></em></p>
<p>I found Andy&rsquo;s stuff after he joined up with Caedmon&rsquo;s. When he recorded <em>The Morning</em> I found a record with which I resonated in a way I never had before. Here was the heart of a man my own age, wrestling with the same life situations I was, pouring his heart out in a way I never could. Also: fantastic production, and a great concept from beginning to end.</p>
<p>9. Miles Davis, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136JQMI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00136JQMI">Kind of Blue</a></em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been into big band since high school, but had never made the progression further on into jazz until I found this record at the library. From the opening of &ldquo;So What&rdquo; I was hooked. Bebop is pretty much my sweet spot for jazz. Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane&hellip; they are where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>10. Jamie Cullum, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R94P4K?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001R94P4K">twentysomething</a></em></p>
<p>Along with the jazz kick, here is a young guy who could rip up the jazz piano, swing over to piano-based pop for a song or two, and then come back to the jazz trio without missing a beat. And he does a jazz cover of Radiohead&rsquo;s &ldquo;High and Dry&rdquo; that kicks some serious butt.</p>
<p>11. Andrew Peterson, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZB0VLU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZB0VLU">Behold the Lamb of God</a></em></p>
<p>If there is another perfect record to go alongside Rich Mullins' <em>Liturgy, Legacy</em>, this is it. Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s &lsquo;true tall tale of the coming of Christ&rsquo; is an amazing concept, filled with beautiful music and tight lyrics, brought into being by an amazing community of musicians. This is the &lsquo;Christmas album&rsquo; that I could listen to year round.</p>
<p>12. Glen Hansard &amp; Marketa Irglova, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136S0NE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00136S0NE">Once: Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack</a></em></p>
<p>It took me a while to get to this little Irish indie movie, but once I did, I bought the soundtrack that same day. Intense, emotional, personal stuff, and the only song I&rsquo;ve heard that actually works in a 5/4 tempo.</p>
<p>13. Iron &amp; Wine, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YN1SF4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000YN1SF4">The Shepherd&rsquo;s Dog</a></em></p>
<p>This low-fi, folky thing is a beautiful piece of work. I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say about it, but it keeps coming back into my listening rotation. That consistency means something.</p>
<p>14. The Khrusty Brothers, <em>Jonas Is Back</em></p>
<p>This one is the oddball. This brainchild of Don Chaffer (who usually headlines Waterdeep) is essentially a collection of songs that he probably couldn&rsquo;t have gotten away with recording under his own name. Good lyrics, sticky melodies, and a killer track called &ldquo;Sympathy for Jesus&rdquo;. Not linked because I don&rsquo;t know where you can get it anymore. Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Khrusty-Brothers/17555705599">their Facebook page</a>, though.</p>
<p>15. Radiohead, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011TQLA2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0011TQLA2">In Rainbows</a></em></p>
<p>For the longest time Radiohead didn&rsquo;t make sense to me. I downloaded <em>In Rainbows</em> when it first came out (for free!), listened to it once, shook my head in confusion, and turned it off. But then a year or two later I turned it back on, heard it with fresh ears, and was transfixed. Then I proceeded to work back through the Radiohead catalog and find records like <em>Kid A</em>, <em>The Bends</em>, and <em>OK Computer</em>. While &ldquo;Fake Plastic Trees&rdquo; from <em>The Bends</em> has to be my favorite Radiohead song of all time, <em>In Rainbows</em> tops my list as a beginning-to-end record.</p>

			 <p>Responses from right-wingers and evangelical Christians to the so-called &ldquo;Ground Zero mosque&rdquo; have been spread broadly throughout the cable news media and online news and opinion sites over the past few weeks. Initial responses were typical God-and-country red meat, <a href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/08/14/sarah-palin-questions-obamas-support-for-ground-zero-mosque/">proclaiming Ground Zero to be &ldquo;hallowed ground&rdquo;</a>, and declaring that allowing Muslims to build a mosque on that site would be, (to borrow a tired phrase,) to let the terrorists win.</p>
<p>This response, despite the patriotic fervor with which it was proclaimed, has now finally widely been debunked (including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/opinion/22rich.html?_r=1&amp;ref=frankrich">a great bit by Frank Rich today</a> in the <em>New York Times</em>). First off, the proposed building isn&rsquo;t a mosque, but a cultural center. And it isn&rsquo;t planned for the &ldquo;Ground Zero&rdquo; World Trade Center site; it&rsquo;s actually two blocks away. And <a href="http://daryllang.com/blog/4421">similar &ldquo;hallowed ground&rdquo; within a two-block radius</a> of Ground Zero houses an off-track betting establishment, a strip club, multiple fast-food restaurants, and several souvenir shops (just to name a few), so it&rsquo;s not like the whole area has been somehow &lsquo;set apart&rsquo;. And finally, what does it say about our belief in religious freedom if, after due process has been followed, we then want then government to prohibit the building of a religious center based strictly on the particular religion in question?</p>
<p>Those points may not yet have gained full acceptance, especially among Republicans looking for an election-year issue, but in general I&rsquo;ve seen them make inroads in he past few weeks.</p>
<p>But yesterday on the Christian group blog Evangel, <a href="http://firstthings.com/blogs/evangel/2010/08/islam-in-america-are-we-ready/">a post by Tom Gilson</a> (a strategist with Campus Crusade for Christ) brings up what I believe will be the next round of argument against the project: saying that if we look at this strictly as a religious liberty issue, we are making the mistake of believing that Islam is simply another religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A friend] views Islam as a religion that deserves the same rights and privileges as any other. That’s questionable, to say the least&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
If you think the Ground Zero mosque comes down to a simple matter of symbolism, or of religious freedom, then you don’t understand the issues deeply enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, the author proclaims, Islam is a way of belief whose ultimate goal is domination, and that if we don&rsquo;t watch out, America will simply be Islam&rsquo;s next conquest.</p>
<p>On this topic I have heard and seen much from both sides. I have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743289692?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743289692">Ayaan Hirsi Ali&rsquo;s chilling account of growing up in Somalia</a> and her passionate assertion that Islam, as a religion, denigrates women. I have also heard first-hand from a Zimbabwean Christian pastor who warned that the Islam he encountered in Africa was intent on conquest. But by the same token I have worked for many years alongside Muslims who are gentle, family men, who had no aspirations but to provide for their families and to live here peaceably as neighbors and friends. (And, let&rsquo;s face it, I can no more fairly hold all Muslims responsible for 9/11 than they can fairly hold all Christians responsible for Timothy McVeigh, Aryan separatists, and, oh, the Crusades.)</p>
<p>The more I think on this subject, the more I am convinced that once again right-wing Christians like Mr. Gilson have mixed up their politics with their religion and gotten it wrong. Nowhere does the Bible instruct us to protect our turf, to repel the unbelieving alien, and to presciently foil those who might intend to persecute us. But it does instruct us, often, to love our neighbors. To turn the other cheek when wronged. It reminds us over and over that our battles are spiritual battles, not physical ones. That Jesus already is Lord, and that we need not fear what mortal men can do to us.</p>
<p>We should stop fighting new mosques at every opportunity, and stop making enemies of dear people for whom Christ died. Instead, we should follow Christ&rsquo;s command and love them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to apply <a href="http://esv.to/Mt5.38-42">Jesus' teaching about giving both coat and cloak</a>. If someone comes and says &lsquo;give us land to build a mosque&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t just give the land; also bring cold water (in the name of Jesus) to those who are laboring to build it.</p>

Whether it&rsquo;s the obsession with being culturally savvy, or with being technologically cutting-edge, or with using shock tactics (&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve never heard your pastor talk about *this* before&rsquo;), McCracken argues that they are simply gimmicks that may bring people in the door; &ldquo;But&rdquo;, he asks &ldquo;what sort of Christianity are they being converted to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quoting David Wells, he further adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the further irony is that the younger generations who are less impressed by whiz-bang technology, who often see through what is slick and glitzy, and who have been on the receiving end of enough marketing to nauseate them, are as likely to walk away from these oh-so-relevant churches as to walk into them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McCracken concludes that &ldquo;cool Christianity&rdquo; is not a &ldquo;sustainable path forward&rdquo;, and that, &ldquo;when it comes to church, [twentysomethings] don&rsquo;t want cool as much as we want real&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading the whole post. I, for one, give him a hearty Amen.</p>

			 <p>Today we had the chance to enjoy what is an increasingly rare occurrence: all four of my siblings and my parents were here in Hiawatha to visit, giving us the whole family in one place at one time. (Well, almost the whole family: Andrew&rsquo;s wife Heather had to stay back in Washington and work. We missed her.)</p>
<p>I have such a great bunch of siblings. Three brothers who are godly men, working hard and making their way on both ends of the country and in the middle. (Andrew &amp; Heather are in Washington; Ryan is in Brooklyn, NY; Aaron and Emily are in Wisconsin.) One little sister who is just a shade (OK, maybe a little more than a shade) spoiled by her big brothers but who can keep up with all of us, anytime, anywhere. Mom and Dad came down from Wisconsin for the day, too, so we had lots of fun and frivolity and food. Much Mario Kart was played, many hot dogs were consumed, and much shrieking was heard from the girls as they ran between parents, grandparents, uncles, and aunt.</p>
<p>Clever and cheesy wordplay seems to be a hallmark of our family gatherings. We have a predisposition for puns and a love of mangling phrases. One such highlight from the visit is worth repeating, if only as an illustration.</p>
<p>Andrew, talking to Ryan, mentioned something about a &ldquo;love cube&rdquo;. I have no idea what that meant. However, it immediately made me think of the song &ldquo;Love Shack&rdquo;, so I started singing a twisted version:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The love cube is a polygon where&hellip; we can get together&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>OK, yeah, cheesy. They indulged me with a chuckle. But then Ryan, per usual, came up with a retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if you were involved in that love cube polygon thing, would you be&hellip; a&hellip; &lsquo;polygonist&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groan.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was a great blessing to have everybody under one roof, if only for a day. God is good.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to see how a new word evolves, especially in the case where a word is introduced not via written text, but rather via audible means. Twenty-one years ago Homer Simpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rsquo;oh!&rdquo; appeared on the cultural scene, and quickly became a part of the American lexicon. Its addition to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2000 officially marked its transition from a cartoon interjection to an accepted part of the ever-evolving English language.</p>
<p>With &ldquo;D&rsquo;oh!&rdquo;, a standard written form of the word was quickly propagated by means of episode titles of The Simpsons. The past few years, though, have introduced a new interjection with much less apparent standardization. I&rsquo;m talking, of course, about Tina Fey&rsquo;s portrayal of the character Liz Lemon on the popular NBC sitcom <em>30 Rock</em>, and her exclamation of disgust that Wikipedia appears to have settled on spelling &ldquo;blerg&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Anyone surfing the web in the past couple of years will have encountered any number of variant spellings, all apparently based around the various authors' ideas of how it should be spelled. Google is of great help in honing in on the popular options.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Blergh&rsquo; - about 94,700 results.</strong></p>
<p>Adding an &lsquo;h&rsquo; to the end is a popular way to go - Blergh is quickly found on <a href="http://www.wisebread.com/blergh-could-you-eat-these-strange-canned-foods">this budgeting website</a> and as the name of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/BLERGH/82516992007">the self-proclaimed &ldquo;official boy band of the 21st century&rdquo;</a>, an Aussie group whose Facebook page, as of today, boasts 17 fans.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Blerg&rsquo; - about 47,500 results.</strong></p>
<p>This comes as a bit of a surprise, given that this is the spelling that Wikipedia has settled on. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Lemon">Liz Lemon page on Wikipedia</a> provides some insight into usage: &ldquo;Liz also has a tendency to say the words &ldquo;blerg&rdquo; and &ldquo;nerds&rdquo; as a replacement for swear words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Blurg&rsquo; - about 170,000 results</strong></p>
<p>It is apparent that the English-speaking world thinks that the /ur/ spelling is more intuitive than the /er/. Additional popularity for this spelling is evidenced by blogs named with this spelling, for instance <a href="http://blurg.wordpress.com">blurg.tumblr.com</a> and <a href="http://blurg.wordpress.com">blurg.wordpress.com</a>, and the fact that my wife uses it in all of her instant message sessions. (No major blog links showed up for the first two spellings. Grab &lsquo;em while you can!)</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;Blurgh&rsquo; - about 214,000 results</strong></p>
<p>What is it with the added &lsquo;h&rsquo;? This hefty spelling appears to be the most popular, and has the added weight of being the spelling used by Tina Fey when <a href="http://blog.nbc.com/30rock/2007/04/blurgh.php">she wrote about it on the 30 Rock blog</a>.</p>
<p>A hint as to the fictional origin of the word can be seen in a shot from the Pilot episode of <em>30 Rock</em> where this pile of unassembled Ikea-esque furniture is shown in Liz Lemon&rsquo;s apartment:</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/1d6d56ea21.jpg" alt="blerg"></p>
<p>Come to think of it, I might use the name of pesky assemble-it-yourself furniture as a swear word, too, if I were coining words. Using the <strong>ë</strong>, though, makes it a little bit tough to type. As for me, I&rsquo;ll stick with &lsquo;blerg&rsquo;.</p>

			 <p><a href="/10/05/church-shopping-and-cultural-polarization/">Yesterday&rsquo;s post on church shopping and cultural polarization</a> reminded me of a question I&rsquo;ve been cogitating on for the past week or two.</p>
<p><strong>What would it look like if we were forced to go back to attending local community churches? How would it affect our view of what was necessary in a church and what things were &ldquo;essentials&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>Say gas prices spiked to the point where we couldn&rsquo;t afford to drive the 10 miles each way to our church of choice. Our choices are now walking or riding bicycles on Sunday morning. In my neighborhood, that would limit my choices to four churches, one Catholic, one United Church of Christ, one &ldquo;Community of Christ&rdquo; (which I know very little about) and one Lutheran Church Missouri Synod.</p>
<p>In our 2008 church search (not limited by driving distance) we didn&rsquo;t really consider any Lutheran churches; would a walking-distance limit change my mind? Probably, given my options. Another possibility: would we canvas the neighborhood to see if there were other like-minded evangelicals who wanted to meet in a house church with us? Seems like an option, but it also seems somewhat fractured and silly given that there&rsquo;s a LCMS church in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>See how quick the criteria changes? All of a sudden I&rsquo;m thinking about what might be &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; rather than finding the church that&rsquo;s exactly what I want. So what I&rsquo;ve proved (to myself, at least) here is that in my non-distance-limited church choosing I&rsquo;ve unconsciously made a tradeoff, choosing a church that more closely aligns with my doctrinal and worship style comfort zone above a local church that would have me going to worship with my neighbors.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an unusual trade-off; it&rsquo;s one that our suburban culture has widely adopted. Gas is (relatively) cheap, driving everywhere is natural, and so we spend time in the car to associate, or shop, or worship, with those of our choosing rather than those of our neighborhood. And this post isn&rsquo;t really all that different from a slew of other blog posts and books wrestling with the suburban culture and longing for a true local community.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a challenging exercise to think through. What churches would you have as options? What would you do?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>CNN.com has a blog post today exploring &ldquo;<a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/24/how-church-shopping-is-polarizing-the-country/">How Church Shopping is Polarizing the Country</a>&rdquo;. Written by law professors Naomi Cahn (George Washington University) and June Carbone (University of Missouri Kansas City) who have recently co-authored a book on cultural polarization, the particular focus on church shopping intrigued me. Heck, I was church shopping not all that long ago. I&rsquo;m helping cause cultural polarization? I must know more.</p>
<p>Fascinating (and saddening) are their definitions of the two polarized camps: <strong>traditionalists</strong>, who &ldquo;&hellip;believe in an eternal and transcendent authority that tells us what is good, what is true, how we should live, and who we are&rdquo;, and <strong>modernists</strong>, who &ldquo;&hellip;would redefine historic faiths according to the prevailing assumptions of contemporary life&rdquo;. Modernists, they note, &ldquo;&hellip;have become less likely to attend church at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In previous generations, they say, both modernists and traditionalists tended to attend the same churches, typically right in their community. Today, though, the ability to church-shop has the traditionalists seeking out churches that affirm their &ldquo;personal values&rdquo;, and has modernists staying home.</p>
<p>The authors lament the decline of the mainline Protestant denominations that in previous generations housed both camps, and complain that today&rsquo;s evangelical churches (full of like-minded traditionalists) are self-reinforcing in belief, and that evangelicalism&rsquo;s close ties to the Republican Party serve to marginalize those who might be in agreement politically but not religiously (or <em>vice versa</em>). In the end, they say, traditionalists group together and talk only to themselves, and modernists leave church altogether, resulting in an increasingly polarized society.</p>
<p>There are certainly places where I disagree with the authors' views on the topic. I think that Protestants seeking churches where their beliefs are shared and reinforced is a <strong>good</strong> thing. And drawing rosy pictures of a post-WWII generation where everyone attended the same community church <em>regardless</em> of what they believed only serves to hide the fact that those weak, any-belief-is-OK churches in large part <em>helped cause</em> the modernist/traditionalist divide we see today, by valuing the form-over-substance mindset that was eventually cynically discarded by Generation X.</p>
<p>However, within the microcosm that is the evangelical church, there are good lessons to be learned here. We need to be vigilant to ensure that we limit our &ldquo;distinctives&rdquo; to the fundamental Gospel truths. As soon as our teaching, or even our church culture, becomes, even by way of unspoken assumptions, &lsquo;the gospel plus conservative politics&rsquo; or &lsquo;the gospel plus homeschooling&rsquo; or &lsquo;the gospel plus pre-millennial dispensationalism&rsquo;, etc., we will alienate those who either desperately need to hear the Gospel or who could be vibrant, participating members of our local body.</p>
<p>The good news that Jesus Christ is Lord of all is polarizing. We should not be surprised when law professors find it so. But there is still a lesson for us here: let the Gospel be polarizing, not the cultural things we are so apt to add on to it.</p>

			 <p>Some weeks at work are calm, with just a few meetings and only one or two things to keep track of. Then there are weeks like this week, when the meetings are numerous, the to-dos are flying left and right, and the number of things to keep track of increases exponentially. It&rsquo;s about at this point that I start to despair that I will ever actually keep track of it all. I&rsquo;ve had a hodge-podge of tools that I&rsquo;ve tried to use in the past, with only middling success. I&rsquo;d love to find the right tool (or toolset) to meet my needs, so I&rsquo;m throwing it out here to help organize my thoughts, and to open it up for any input my multitude of geeky and resourceful friends might have.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need (or at least really want)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar to keep track of meetings</li>
<li>Ability to attach notes to meetings - would allow me to keep track of my thoughts in preparation for the meeting.</li>
<li>Task manager to organize and prioritize tasks. Tagging/filtering for work/personal/etc would be a bonus.</li>
<li>Ability to take notes/record meeting minutes. Once they are in the past I don&rsquo;t necessarily need to tie the meeting notes to the calendar item - rather, I&rsquo;d like to just be able to tag and search the notes when necessary.</li>
<li>Ability to reasonably input data from my work computer when I&rsquo;m at my desk. (If I have a mobile device, if at all possible I don&rsquo;t want to have to step away from my computer to enter the data into another device.) I guess this implies syncing w/ my work PC.</li>
<li>Ability to sync w/ my work calendar would be a bonus, but seems like a low-probability item given that IT restricts syncing w/ the company network to company-issued devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I&rsquo;ve tried in the past:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a> - this syncs fairly well with my iPod Touch. However, this is limited by the fact that I can only sync it at home during the evening (no Wifi access at work). It also doesn&rsquo;t provide much useful ability to attach notes to meetings.</li>
<li><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/">Tasks</a> - This nifty web-based tool from Alex King is serviceable for recording to-dos, including recurring items, etc. Works great any place I&rsquo;m actually at a computer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> - tried it for a little while, but it didn&rsquo;t seem exceptionally usable. There is an iPod Touch version but again I run into the syncing issue. I need to be able to sync more often than once per day.</li>
<li>Notebook - this retro analog device works well with a #2 pencil or black ink pen. It&rsquo;s great for recording notes but quickly it gets messy and disorganized. It works best when I bring it back to my desk and then copy to-dos into Tasks or onto a paper task list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A little analysis</strong></p>
<p>OK, so let&rsquo;s face it: my desire for something that stays synced up on a regular basis is a limiting factor. Given that syncing with my work network is unlikely impossible, I&rsquo;m pushing myself toward a personal device w/ some sort of over-the-air network connection.</p>
<p>When I <a href="http://twitter.com/cjhubbs/status/12104844648">posted my first lament on twitter</a> this morning, <a href="http://www.thesimoneaus.com">Mark Simoneau</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/marksim/statuses/12110036794">recommended</a> Cultured Code&rsquo;s <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>. And I&rsquo;ll admit, it does look pretty sweet. It doesn&rsquo;t specifically do calendar integration, but it does very nice, slick task management, including tagging, categorizing, grouping into projects, etc. There is an iPhone/iTouch version available, which will sync with the desktop. The only big hangup for me is that it only runs on a Mac. Which makes this Windows-office user a sad panda.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tempted at times to just go to using a paper daily planner. Advantages: it allows me to take notes, add agenda notes to calendar entries, input method is relatively quick. Disadvantages: no syncing, sorting, or searching.</p>
<p>So any thoughts from you all out there? I&rsquo;d love to just go with a solution like Things on a 3G-enabled iPad, but that&rsquo;s $700 I can&rsquo;t afford right now.</p>

			 <p>Just found a link to a great thought that <a href="http://gospeldrivenchurch.blogspot.com/2010/01/gospel-frees-you-from-tyranny-of-hyper.html">Jared Wilson posted back in January</a>. Given that it&rsquo;s only a paragraph, and it&rsquo;s a good one, I&rsquo;ll quote it in its entirety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, people watch too much TV and play too many video games and spend too much time on the Internet and what-have-you. But the proper response to our media over-saturation is not a rigorous attention to the explicitly &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; in every margin of life. Be a Christian, not an ascetic. Don&rsquo;t be lazy, but realize that Jesus Christ did not die and rise for you so that you would stress out about whether you&rsquo;re being spiritual enough. So take a nap. Watch some television. The gospel frees you to chill the heck out.</p>

			 <p>I have learned much over the past several years from brothers and sisters of the Reformed theological persuasion. I love and respect them deeply. But the good Dr. Daniel J. R. Kirk <a href="http://www.jrdkirk.com/?p=375">today puts his finger on</a> a point which has provided me some unease in my conversations with my Reformed brethren, saying it, as usual, more succinctly than I could.</p>
<p>Quoth Daniel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doctrine Good. Stories Bad. That’s the mini-theme of this month’s Christianity Today.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I begin with the most egregious offense. There’s a short inset on p. 26, snipped from a book by J. I. Packer and Gary A. Parrett (Grounded in the Gospel; Baker, 2010) entitled, “The Lost Art of Catechesis.” The point? Back in the old days, folks used to have to learn their theology. That waned for a bit, but was revived in all its glory in the Reformation. Doctrine. The church has to learn its doctrine.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When did this all go astray between then and now? When Sunday Schools entrusted instruction to lay people and rather than teaching people theology substituted “instilling of familiarity (or shall we say, perhaps, over-familiarity) with Bible stories” (26).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel, though, strongly disagrees, and he hammers it home here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the classic inversion of sola scriptura: no longer do we really want you to do what the Reformers did (read your Bible), we want you instead to read and memorize what they said after they had read their Bibles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <em>that</em> is the unease I&rsquo;ve always had w/ the Reformed types. So often when asked a question, they don&rsquo;t respond w/ Scripture, but rather with a quote from one of the Confessions or with a paragraph from Calvin or Edwards or Spurgeon or Packer.</p>
<p>I know, I know, those Confessions are a distillation of the church&rsquo;s understanding of the whole Scripture over the years, and useful as a doctrinal reference and as a safeguard against taking any single Scripture passage wildly out of context. But Dr. Kirk makes a great point here: our first priority and focus should be to the Scripture, and the Confessions and Institutes need to come later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from some of my Reformed buddies on this one. And yeah, I&rsquo;m afraid what I might be in for when they pile on. :-)</p>

<li>We have high temperatures in the 50&rsquo;s forecast for this week. Incredibly thankful for spring to be making an appearance.</li>
<li>Stayed up too late watching the Oscars last night. Have watched only two of the films nominated across all categories: <em>District 9</em> and <em>Star Trek</em>. One of these days I&rsquo;ll catch up on some of the others. Very little time for watching movies these days.</li>
<li><em>Star Trek</em> is the last movie I&rsquo;ve watched in a theater. Before that I think it was <em>The Dark Knight</em> the year before. At least that gives us lots of choices to watch on DVD.</li>
<li>Three day work week for me this week. Then on Thursday we road trip to Indiana. Becky and the girls will drop me off in Indianapolis where I&rsquo;ll hang out/ride along with <a href="http://www.ilikeandy.com">Andy Osenga</a> for a couple days while he plays some house shows.</li>
<li>Becky and the girls will head up an hour north of Indy to visit some friends who moved there from CR last year. Everyone is pretty darn excited about it.</li>
<li>Have the details lined up for Andy O to play a &ldquo;house show&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.brewedcr.com">Brewed Awakenings</a> in CR on Monday, April 19th. Hope to get the &ldquo;official&rdquo; confirmation from Andy this week so I can start publicity in earnest.</li>

			 <p>A follow-on to <a href="/10/03/on-the-superiority-of-the-canadian-national-anthem/">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a> about the superiority of &lsquo;O Canada&rsquo;:</p>
<p>I was not surprised to read that there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada">official lyrics in both English and French</a> for the anthem. I was surprised a bit, though, at the stark difference in the message of the two versions.</p>
<p>First, the familiar English version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Canada! Our home and native land!<br>
True patriot love in all thy sons command.<br>
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,<br>
The True North strong and free!<br>
From far and wide, O Canada,<br>
We stand on guard for thee.<br>
God keep our land glorious and free!<br>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But compare that with this English translation of the French lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Canada! Land of our ancestors,<br>
Thy brow is wreathed with a glorious garland of flowers.<br>
As is thy arm ready to wield the sword,<br>
So also is it ready to carry the cross.<br>
Thy history is an epic Of the most brilliant exploits.<br>
Thy valour steeped in faith<br>
Will protect our homes and our rights<br>
Will protect our homes and our rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very different flavor to those, eh? An &ldquo;arm ready to wield the sword&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;ready to carry the cross&rdquo;. And rather than the English version standing on guard for the country, the French version stands in protection of &ldquo;our homes and our rights&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fascinating how they&rsquo;ve chosen to keep the tune and meter the same between both versions, and accepted the inevitable difference in lyrical content.</p>

			 <p>Watching the winter Olympics over the past two weeks, I caught at least a few of the medal ceremonies, including at least a couple (including the one after the amazing hockey game yesterday) where the Canadian anthem was played. Each time I was struck with the same thought, which I finally voiced on Twitter yesterday: that the Canadian national anthem is highly superior to ours. One friend expressed the same thought, but another quickly disagreed. So, let me offer a few thoughts in defense of my assertion.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons that &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Canada">O Canada</a>&rsquo; is superior to &lsquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Spangled_Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>'</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Singability.</strong> The purpose of a national anthem is to be <em>sung</em>, right? &lsquo;O Canada&rsquo; has a nice, singable melody, and a total range of just one octave, suitable to most voices. &lsquo;The Star-Spangled Banner&rsquo;, on the other hand, has a range of an octave and a fifth, which is a range typically only well-handled by professional singers. Live performances should be opportunities for national pride, however, when the US anthem is involved, they are more often adventures in vocal torture.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiring Language.</strong> &lsquo;The True North strong and free.&rsquo; What a marvelous turn of phrase. And who can fail to be moved when singing &ldquo;God keep our land glorious and free&rdquo;? The Star Spangled Banner is just about a flag, with the bit about the country being sort of tacked on at the end.</li>
<li><strong>Using words that people actually are familiar with.</strong> With exception, perhaps, of the old English &ldquo;thy&rdquo; and &ldquo;thee&rdquo;, &ldquo;O Canada&rdquo; is composed entirely of words that one might use in everyday writing or conversation. &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo;, by comparison? <em>Spangled. Perilous. Ramparts. Gallantly.</em> Ugh.</li>
<li><strong>Actually mentioning the name of the country</strong>. &ldquo;O Canada&rdquo;: 4 mentions, not counting the title. &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner&rdquo;: 0.</li>
<li><strong>Not beginning and ending with a question</strong>. Questions typically belong in plaintive, whiny songs, not broad anthems. Starting off &ldquo;O say can you see?&rdquo; and ending with &ldquo;O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave?&rdquo;, while presumably intended as rhetorical flourishes, doesn&rsquo;t impart the same sort of solidarity as &ldquo;O Canada, we stand on guard for Thee&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, any attempt to change the US anthem at this point would only result in choosing something worse. &ldquo;God Bless America&rdquo; is too overtly theistic to get official sanction; &ldquo;America the Beautiful&rdquo; has many of the same issues as the current anthem (hard to sing, odd words). There are occasional odd choices proposed, too, similarly troublesome. For instance, Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Land Is Your Land&rdquo;: written by a communist sympathizer. And who wants to hear a folksy protest song played at the beginning of every sporting event and solemn political occasion?</p>
<p>Being a loyal American I will continue to honor my country by standing when the national anthem is played. But I will at the same time regret that our inferior anthem ensures that we will never have a scene like the one that played out in the Canadian hockey arena yesterday, with 18,000 victorious fans singing the anthem at the top of their lungs.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I traveled with five coworkers from Cedar Rapids, IA to Wichita, KS, to participate in our quarterly update meeting with the FAA.</p>
<p>Normally, commercial travel to Wichita from CR means taking a flight connecting through either Chicago O&rsquo;Hare or Dallas-Fort Worth. For a Wednesday morning meeting you&rsquo;d need to leave CR early afternoon on Tuesday, spend hours in airports, 3 - 4 hours actually flying, spend the night overnight in Wichita, then reverse the procedure on Wednesday afternoon to fly home, possibly making it home in early evening&hellip; assuming the weather is decent and all the flight connections happen.</p>
<p>To counter this massive hassle and resulting lack of productivity for several engineers, enter this fine little piece of hardware: the company <a href="http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/hawker_800xp/">Hawker 800 XP</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/38040645c0.jpg" alt="Hawker 800 XP"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fitted out nicely on the inside, too, similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7393ff6d5e.jpg" alt="Hawker interior"></p>
<p>Being able to fly on our company jet made our itinerary for the trip to Wichita run something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>0715: Arrive at company facility at CR airport</li>
<li>0716: Announce myself and get name checked off on the manifest</li>
<li>0725: Walk out onto the tarmac and board the plane</li>
<li>0730: One of the pilots points out the emergency exits to me, the first-timer</li>
<li>0735: We take off. Once we climb out, we cruise at 36,000 feet and nearly 600 MPH</li>
<li>0840: Land in Wichita. Climb off the plane and walk across the street to the FAA office.</li>
<li>0900 - 1230: Meet with the FAA</li>
<li>1230: Walk back across the street to the airport</li>
<li>1245: Board the aircraft and take off again</li>
<li>1300: Eat a box lunch after we&rsquo;re back up at 36,000 feet</li>
<li>1405: Land back in CR</li>
<li>1415: Get off the plane after being towed into the hangar</li>
<li>1435: Arrive back home</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s still stunning to me - we went down to Wichita, had a half-day meeting, came home, and didn&rsquo;t even use the full workday.</p>
<p>I am now spoiled to commercial air travel forever.</p>

			 <p>Last night Becky and I sat down to watch the second episode ( titled <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/121425/human-target-rewind">&ldquo;Rewind&rdquo;</a>) of the Fox show <em>Human Target</em>. The first episode was fun in a cheesy action-thriller sort of way, so we decided to give it a continued try.</p>
<p>Back in high school, I had some friends whose dad was a submarine officer in the US Navy. They said it was unbearable to watch <em>The Hunt for Red October</em> around him because he spent the whole moving groaning at the inaccuracies it portrayed in the submarine. After watching this episode of Human Target, I think I now know how he felt. As an avionics systems engineer, the details of this in-air plot just drove me batty. Allow me to elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> the plane is going down for no apparent reason. Yes, there&rsquo;s a fire down in the fuselage, but that shouldn&rsquo;t cause complete loss of control.</p>
<p><strong>Second,</strong> they&rsquo;ve gotta put the fire out, and apparently there is more wind flow over the top of the aircraft than the bottom (???? Totally bogus) so the solution is to <em>fly upside down</em> until the increased airflow puts the fire out. Are you kidding me?!? We&rsquo;re not talking a fighter jet here, we&rsquo;re talking a large airliner. While there is this rather famous video of Boeing test pilot Tex Johnston doing a barrel roll in a 707, look at how much altitude he loses just turning the thing over! There&rsquo;s no way the airplane could stay airborne and upside down for long, much less the <strong><em>fifteen minutes or so</em></strong> that it does in this episode.</p>
<p><strong>Third,</strong> while they&rsquo;re flying along upside down, suddenly they can&rsquo;t flip it back around to right-side-up because the on-board computer locked up. We&rsquo;ll ignore the detail that they say the &ldquo;flight management&rdquo; computer locked up when, in reality, it&rsquo;s the flight <em>control</em> computer that would help them fly the plane. Once the pilot diagnoses that it&rsquo;s locked up, somebody asks if they can&rsquo;t just reboot it. And of course the answer is no, they can&rsquo;t. By this point I&rsquo;m yelling at the tv screen. &ldquo;OF COURSE YOU CAN REBOOT IT YOU IDIOTS! POP THE FREAKING BREAKER AND RESET IT AND YOU&rsquo;LL REBOOT IN JUST A FEW SECONDS!!!&rdquo; (Becky is not appreciating me too much at this point.) But apparently NONE OF THEM REALIZE THAT, since they then have to go on to&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Fourth,</strong> the amazing computer hacker on board decides she can somehow download the flight management software onto her laptop, patch the laptop into the aircraft system, and use it to control the plane. About the only thing that whole sequence gets right is that there are ethernet-based networks on modern aircraft. But it would be next thing to impossible to hack into the system to download the software, and COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to then patch that laptop into the system. And why was she able to download the software right there in the (upside-down) cabin, but to patch it into the aircraft system, they had to go down to the avionics bay?</p>
<p><strong>Fifth,</strong> once they got down to the amazingly-spacious avionics bay, they apparently were able to just unplug a standard RJ45 ethernet jack (and normal-looking ethernet cable) from the aircraft wiring and plug it into the laptop, and SHAZAM! it worked! What they ignore is that standard ethernet wiring and a plastic RJ45 jack would never pass aircraft environmental and vibration testing. All ethernet connections in an avionics system are routed through stout metal screw-on connectors, not secured with wimpy plastic clips.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s the world of TV, which means that yes, everything worked out fine inside of an hour, the bad guys were caught, the good guys survived to fight another day, and the hero got in his wisecracks just before the credits rolled. (Oh, and fun side-note: two episodes of Human Target, two appearances by actors who had major roles in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. For whatever that&rsquo;s worth in your geek scoring system.) Next time, I hope they just stay off the airplanes so I don&rsquo;t have to deal with knowing too much about reality for my hour of entertainment.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.holidayatthesea.com/?p=2177">Brent Thomas posted yesterday</a> on the question of &ldquo;fencing the table&rdquo; at communion, and while the comment thread on his post has gone down the path of fencing based on doctrinal fidelity (ah, those Calvinists!), I&rsquo;ve been more thinking about it from my evangelical perspective, and the idea of partaking &ldquo;in an unworthy manner&rdquo;. (Thanks to my brother Andrew for batting around some thoughts with me.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+11&amp;version=NIV">1 Corinthians 11</a> is the relevant passage here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God&rsquo;s approval. When you come together, it is not the Lord&rsquo;s Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. Don&rsquo;t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, &ldquo;This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.&rdquo; In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.&rdquo; For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until he comes.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 32When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, in the churches I&rsquo;ve been in, the pastor typically instructs the congregation something along these lines before communion is served: &ldquo;take a minute quietly, examine your heart, ask God to reveal sin to you that needs confessed, then confess and partake. Don&rsquo;t take it unworthily.&rdquo; And while these are good instructions, <em>I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re actually the point of the passage</em>.</p>
<p>The problem Paul is addressing with the Corinthians isn&rsquo;t that there are a bunch of unrepentant sinners partaking of communion (which undoubtedly there were), but rather that people are coming and gobbling up the food in a haphazard, flippant, gluttonous fashion, not recognizing, as Paul says, that this is the body of the Lord. They&rsquo;re not taking it as a serious remembrance. Paul&rsquo;s corrective summary in verse 33 doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;repent of your sins before you partake!&rdquo; - rather, it says &ldquo;wait for each other&rdquo;. Paul is emphasizing the corporate nature of this sacrament, something that the Corinthians seem to have forgotten.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to discount the need for examining our hearts as we come before God in worship - in Matthew 5:23-24 Jesus says to go make things right with your brother before you come to the altar to sacrifice to God. But I&rsquo;ve talked to people who told me &ldquo;you know, I thought about it, and I remembered something I needed to settle with another person, so I let the elements go by and didn&rsquo;t partake&rdquo;, and this, to me, seems to be entirely missing the point.</p>
<p>Partaking of the bread and the cup in communion is a reminder of the sacrifice that gave us salvation. In giving us salvation, God calls us to repent and believe, even knowing full well that perfect repentance won&rsquo;t ever happen for us this side of eternity. In communion, God calls us to remember the death of His Son, with the same heart of brokenness and repentance that is working in our salvation, even as He knows that each of us will go back out and willfully commit sin.</p>
<p>To put it another way: communion isn&rsquo;t intended to be for Christians who&rsquo;ve somehow managed to get everything cleaned up. In examining ourselves, we should quickly recognize that we wretched, miserable sinners desperately need Jesus' blood to cleanse us every day. And in partaking, we should not fear that we&rsquo;ve somehow forgotten a sin and so God is going to smack us, but rather should be humbly thankful for the awesome gift we have been given.</p>

			 <p>Time to start something new around here - from time to time I&rsquo;ll highlight a record that I&rsquo;ve been playing. I&rsquo;ll start with a rather obscure one this afternoon: Brian Eno&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Music-Airports-Brian-Eno/dp/B0002PZVH0%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002PZVH0"><em>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ambient-Music-Airports-Brian-Eno/dp/B0002PZVH0%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIPY5W5ZYJHYH2ALQ%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0002PZVH0"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0f99feec83.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_eno">Brian Eno</a> is pretty much the king of ambient music, and Ambient 1 is one of his earlier works, dating back to 1978. This isn&rsquo;t something that you&rsquo;re going to want to sit down and just focus on for the entire 45 minute playtime, but it makes a beautiful backdrop to an hour, almost fading out here and there but never quite leaving the edges of your consciousness. Even if you&rsquo;re not typically a listener of ambient music, it&rsquo;s worth a try.</p>
<p>No promises about the video content on this one, but the music is worth a listen.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2010/01/05/offering-right-sacrifices.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2010-01-05 09:15:18 -0500">Jan 5, 2010</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In 2010 I&rsquo;m undertaking the <a href="http://journeyon.net/engage/scripture/reading">Bible reading plan</a> put out by <a href="http://journeyon.net">The Journey</a>, and this morning&rsquo;s reading hit an interesting combination of passages - Genesis 4, Psalm 4, and Matthew 4. The theme that links them all: offering right sacrifices to God.</p>
<p>Genesis 4 gives us the familiar story of Cain and Abel. Abel gives the right sort of sacrifice. Cain doesn&rsquo;t. Jealousy and murder ensues. Such a tragic story.</p>
<p>Psalm 4:4 - 8 follows up that sobering story with these verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
5 Offer right sacrifices and trust in the LORD.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
6 Many are asking, &ldquo;Who can show us any good?&rdquo; Let the light of your face shine upon us, O LORD.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
7 You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
8 I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David gets in several zingers here that speak directly to me in my daily situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re angry with what you see happening, don&rsquo;t sin, but rather shut your mouth and search your heart.</li>
<li>Offer right sacrifices and trust the Lord.</li>
<li>The light of God&rsquo;s face on us will bring joy greater than any material possession.</li>
<li>I can sleep in peace knowing that God alone is my security.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are these &ldquo;right sacrifices&rdquo; that God wants from me? A couple of texts quickly come to mind:</p>
<p>1 Samuel 15 - King Saul attempts half-hearted, doing-what-seems-right sacrifices, and is corrected by Samuel: God desires obedience rather than those sacrifices.</p>
<p>Romans 12 - reaffirms the command in 1 Samuel by telling us that we should present our bodies as living sacrifices.</p>
<p>So there it is, loud and clear: the right sacrifice that God desires is our <em>obedience</em>. If I&rsquo;m wearing myself out doing lots of &lsquo;good things&rsquo; thinking that God will be happy with me, while at the same time I&rsquo;m ignoring areas in my life where I&rsquo;m choosing to not be obedient to God, I&rsquo;m doing it wrong. God has already justified me apart from any right living on my part. My obedience to him is an offering to show my love to Him for what He has already done. And, as the Psalmist says, I will find greater joy and peace in that life of obedience than in any striving for material things.</p>
<p>The final passage in today&rsquo;s reading (Matthew 4) fits in nicely with this lesson as well. Jesus goes to the desert and is tempted by Satan with some &lsquo;good&rsquo; things. Jesus, though, sets the example for us by choosing obedience. I would do well to follow.</p>

</ul>
<p>At least I didn&rsquo;t try to go in. First time work has sent people home for snow in the 10 years I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
<p>I think we&rsquo;ve gotten about 8 inches here so far, heavier and wetter than I had anticipated. Now it&rsquo;s time for the temps to drop and the wind to start blowing really hard. Guess I&rsquo;ve gotta hand it to meteorologist Joe Winters, he was right this time. I feel like I should seek him out and do my meekest <a href="http://mediacenter.fedex.designcdt.com/node/271">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Dick Butkus&rdquo;</a> impression.</p>

			 <p>There is a more substantive post or two in here, I promise. But for now - bullet points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sewer pipe was replaced, all the pipes are now flowing smoothly. Thankful for drains that drain and that it all got done before the snow started.</li>
<li>We got our Christmas tree yesterday and amazingly enough Katie hasn&rsquo;t tried to pull it down yet.</li>
<li>In the &ldquo;for the first time in over eight months&rdquo; file: all three girls slept through the night last night. AWESOME.</li>
<li>I was invited to fill the pulpit at our old church plant for the Sunday after Christmas. (The new pastor will be on vacation.) I&rsquo;m honored to be asked. Text will be 1 Peter 1.</li>
<li>Oh yeah, did I say snow? We got just a bit overnight, but the forecasters are calling for the SNOWPOCALYPSE on Tuesday night and Wednesday - or at least 6 - 12 inches of the white stuff, along with 40 - 50 mph winds.</li>
<li>Matt Chandler is the real deal. Continuing to pray for his recovery from brain surgery. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VC5wP2gDrY">pre-surgery video</a> is awesome.</li>
<li>Every time I think I&rsquo;ve gotten to some conclusion on whether we&rsquo;re at the church we should be at long-term, something else comes up that pushes me back the other way. Kinda feels like we&rsquo;re still in a holding pattern. Still praying.</li>
<li>And to finish with the truly trivial, we watched Nebraska do again on Saturday night what they seem to do best - snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory. Nobody deserved to win that Nebraska-Texas game. Texas came away the winner anyway. *sigh*</li>

			 <p>So, those <a href="/09/11/not-exactly-to-plan/">sewer troubles we had last week</a>? They came back. After snaking out the drains on Friday night, by Monday night they were clogged again. Not good. This time I was going to get a better answer, so I called in the professionals. By Wednesday morning we were again cleaned out, but had our answer: we have Orangeburg sewer pipe on our main line, and it was mostly collapsed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sewerhistory.org/articles/compon/orangeburg/orangeburg.htm">&ldquo;Orangeburg&rdquo; pipe</a> is a sewer pipe that was used abundantly in the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s. Manufactured primarily in Orangeburg, New York, it is comprised of wood fibers glued together with a water-resistant adhesive, and then infused with tar. While it was relatively inexpensive, it turns out that it doesn&rsquo;t hold up so well structurally after 30 - 40 years; any shifting in the ground or intrusive tree roots can cause structural collapse. And so it was with our drain line. The guy who came and did a video inspection of our line said he could barely get the 1.5&quot; camera lens through the pipe. Ouch.</p>
<p>We did some quick research on sewer contractors and found a good one who could come fairly quick. In preparation for the job, they graced our front yard with some equipment on Friday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday they will come replace our collapsed glued fiber pipe with some good old-fashioned cast iron, and we should then be set to flush away freely for as long as we live in the house. I suppose it&rsquo;s a good general lesson, too, about engineering using new-fangled technology: sometimes the problems with your solution won&rsquo;t be evident for a while&hellip; it&rsquo;s wise to try to consider the long-term.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What would Jesus want us to think about health care reform?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question that <a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2009/10/28/how-would-jesus-want-us-to-think-about-health-care-legislation/">Justin Taylor proffers at his blog</a>, courtesy of Brad Green, theology professor at Union University.  Professor Green&rsquo;s response to the &ldquo;what would Jesus do&rdquo; question has <a href="http://www.jacksonsun.com/article/20091025/OPINION/910250308/What-is-a-Christian-to-think-about-health-care?">four main points</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conservatives don&rsquo;t think that big new legislation will fix the problems with the system</li>
<li>Conservatives are opposed to the expansion of federal powers as an infringement on liberty</li>
<li>The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t explicitly enumerate power in this area to the Federal government, so Health Care reform would be unconstitutional</li>
<li>Christians have a &ldquo;strong view of human sin and thus are often not inclined to want to grant large amounts of power to any governmental body&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>While I will concur with the final point, in the first three points Professor Green misses the boat in two critical ways.</p>
<p>First, he fails to acknowledge the reality that, regardless of how strictly he&rsquo;d like to interpret the Tenth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court has a long history of allowing the Federal government expanded powers via the Interstate Commerce clause of the Constitution.  Just because he, personally, disagrees with that interpretation doesn&rsquo;t mean that health care reform legislation will be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Second, and far more greviously, Professor Green, by virtue of his first two points, has somehow assumed that Jesus' political views were American Evangelical Conservative.  How else can he leap from &ldquo;What Would Jesus Do?&rdquo; to &ldquo;Conservatives are opposed to this&rdquo;?  If he wants to make the argument that Jesus would&rsquo;ve held those views, he can try to make that argument, but he is foolhardy to think it can just be assumed.</p>
<p>If the evangelical political Right in America wants to oppose increased federal involvement in the health care system, there are reasonable arguments that can be made.  Shoddy reasoning, though, as demonstrated in this article, only makes them look silly.</p>

			 <p>That little announcement made its quarterly reappearance in the church bulletin last Sunday: &ldquo;Times are available for those wishing to become members to meet with the elders.  Call the church office to schedule.&rdquo;  It sits there on the page in eight point font and taunts me.  Church membership.  Am I really ready to join?</p>
<p>Ten years ago when we moved to Iowa we decided on a church relatively quickly, and once there, proceed with similar pace through the membership process.  After eight years there we left to help plant another church.  There was no official &ldquo;membership&rdquo; in the early stages of that church plant, but we were on the core team and I was an elder, so we were quite obviously committed. </p>
<p>When it was clear the Lord was leading us away from the church plant, we finally settled on our current church home, where we&rsquo;ve been attending for a year now.  Not just attending - involved, too.  I&rsquo;m playing on the worship team once a month, Becky is volunteering in the nursery.  We attended the &ldquo;welcome to the family&rdquo; class several months ago.  It was a helpful introduction to the church&rsquo;s history, doctrine, and philosophy of ministry.  At the time, we weren&rsquo;t ready yet to join.  And now, as the announcement comes around again every three months, I wonder again, is it time?</p>
<p>My hesitancy isn&rsquo;t a fear of responsibility or accountability - in fact, I&rsquo;d much prefer being under the authority of a local church body to being some sort of Lone Ranger.  Three months in, I wasn&rsquo;t ready to join mostly because joining felt like dating someone on the rebound - it was just too soon.  We&rsquo;d been with our previous church family for nearly ten years, I wasn&rsquo;t just gonna dive back in.   But now it&rsquo;s been a year.  I don&rsquo;t have any big doctrinal issues that would keep me from joining.  I guess it&rsquo;s just mostly cold feet.  What if this ends up not being the place for us long-term?  On the other hand, how long do we stay in this holding pattern before we should just give up and admit that our current church has become our <em>de facto</em> home church and we should just go ahead and join?</p>
<p>Much to ponder.  Your thoughts are always appreciated.</p>

			 <p>My internet friend Bryan Allain <a href="http://bryanallain.com/archives/2009/10/15/the-defining-moment-of-catalyst-2009/">posted a video on his blog</a> this morning of a moment that happened at the recent Catalyst conference in Atlanta. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll summarize for those of you who don&rsquo;t have 10 minutes to watch the video: it&rsquo;s an amazingly touching story.  A young man from Africa is there live, on stage in front of 12,000 people, telling about his childhood growing up in severe poverty, of a sister who died as an infant from malnutrition, and how then in early childhood he was given a place as part of a <a href="http://www.compassion.com">Compassion International</a> school and was sponsored for over a decade by a man from Canada. The young man is now a student at Moody Bible Institute and sponsoring his own Compassion child.  An amazing story that makes me want to go out and sponsor a Compassion kid <em>right now</em>. </p>
<p>But then, in an Oprah-esque moment, the conference emcee asked &ldquo;have you ever met your sponsor?&quot;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;, the young man replied. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they brought out the Canadian man who had sponsored him for all these years.  And in an incredibly moving scene, the young African man just completely (and understandably) broke down.  After a long embrace this young man could do nothing but sit on the floor and sob, completely overcome with emotion and gratitude for this man who had caused such a change in his life.</p>
<p>I was very torn, watching the video at that moment, between on one hand appreciating the emotions of the situation and on the other hand being disgusted by the planned exploitation of this young man&rsquo;s emotions for the sake of a &ldquo;moment&rdquo; at a conference.  The emcee, himself choking up a minute later, said &ldquo;we script this for <em>me</em> breaking down&hellip;&rdquo; which, of course, means that they <em>did</em> script it expecting that the other two would break down.</p>
<p>So what do you think?  Am I being hard-hearted here?  Or were the producers of the Catalyst conference so sucked into the current reality TV culture that they crossed the line of intentionally manipulating people&rsquo;s emotions just to create a &ldquo;moment&rdquo;?</p>

			 <p>Most of what I remember from Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle is cheesy puns (which are AWESOME, by the way), but there is one phrase that has stuck in my vocabulary: &ldquo;antihistamine money&rdquo;.  An example of usage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, $100?  That&rsquo;s antihistamine money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antihistamine money?&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I keep a notebook at work for scribbling to-dos and other things I need to remember.  I don&rsquo;t go through notebooks very quickly - my short-term memory is pretty good and I use sticky notes and scrap paper when I&rsquo;m at my desk, but a notebook is handy for carrying around to meetings. </p>
<p>Back in February my notebook (a Mead brand 80-sheet 4/5-per-inch &ldquo;quadrille&rdquo;) was starting to fill up (read: it was maybe 2/3 full) so when I noticed a spiffy new National brand Computation Notebook was available in the supply cabinet, I grabbed it. </p>
<p>About that same time I was applying for a new position here at work - a position in line with my long-term career goals, one that I&rsquo;d been hoping to get for a long time.  I knew the manager of that new group wanted to hire me (I was offered the job!), and I was just hoping the process would work out and I could transfer.  So I set the notebook aside and decided that I would symbolically keep it in reserve until I got the transfer to the new position.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, senior management decided I was too critical in my present role to be allowed to transfer.  Both my boss and the manager trying to hire me assured me that they&rsquo;d try to make it work out later on, but in March someone else took that position and I stayed where I was.  I was initially neither very patient or very happy about the situation, but what else was there to do?  So I waited.</p>
<p>Patience is one of those things you probably don&rsquo;t really want to pray for.  The process of learning it isn&rsquo;t fun. But it&rsquo;s a valuable lesson to learn. My old Mead notebook got thinner and thinner through the summer, but I stubbornly left the new notebook on the shelf.  Finally at the end of August I had a moment of weakness and carried the new notebook to a meeting, but didn&rsquo;t need to take any notes.  After the meeting I gathered my resolve and put it back on the shelf.</p>
<p>September 1st rolled around and I got a phone call.  Another job req was opening in that department.  I was welcome to apply again.  I applied.  I re-interviewed.  I waited.  It took nearly the entire month of September to get through the process and see if I would be allowed to transfer this time.  The notebook waited patiently.  Me, not so patiently.  Finally, last Friday, I got the official word: the transfer would be allowed.  And today I got the official phone call confirming that I would take the position, with the transfer effective in two weeks' time.</p>
<p>When my transfer is complete and I start the new position, the old Mead notebook will find its way to a recycle bin, and the patient National notebook will finally take up the role it&rsquo;s been waiting for since last spring.  It will be a happy day for both of us.</p>

<li>Blog posting has been a bit slow lately since I typically post during breaks at work and my blog has mysteriously become inaccessible from work.  IT was no help in fixing it.  I&rsquo;m using Posterous as a sort of go-between - a solution that works but that I&rsquo;m not fond of.</li>
<li>Had a good, full weekend. </li>
<li>Marriage conference Friday night and Saturday morning at church.  Very good.</li>
<li>Watched a fun Hawkeye game Saturday night.  They whooped Penn State good.</li>
<li>Played on the worship team Sunday morning, lots of fun.</li>
<li>Finally got the fascia and soffet on the garage painted.  That&rsquo;s been on my to-do list since last fall.  It looks a lot better.</li>
<li>Found out Friday afternoon that the job transfer I&rsquo;ve been trying to get for the past 6 months will be approved.  Will post something more officially on it once I go through all the official steps.</li>
<li>The upcoming two weeks before the transfer will happen have the potential to drag a good bit.</li>
<li>I have two book reviews that I need to get posted here before the publishers demand their books back.  Problem is, I&rsquo;ve only gotten one of them read so far.  Posting one would be a start, I guess.</li>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2009/09/22/the-left-behind.html">The &#34;Left Behind&#34; influence on the Religious Right</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2009/09/22/the-left-behind.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-09-22 12:50:34 -0500">Sep 22, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a common observation over the past several years that one of the practical results of a &ldquo;Left Behind&rdquo;, dispensational view of the end times is a lack of care for the environment in general - heck, if it&rsquo;s all gonna burn anyway, why should I care?  But the other day it struck me that there is another connection that I haven&rsquo;t heard commented on - a connection between the rise of dispensational end times views and the rise of Republicanism within the evangelical church. </p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s be fair to Tim LaHaye - just because his &ldquo;Left Behind&rdquo; books became so popular this past decade doesn&rsquo;t mean that he dreamed the whole &ldquo;left behind&rdquo; scenario up.  Think back to Hal Lindsey&rsquo;s <em>Late, Great Planet Earth</em>, published in 1970, which became the non-fiction bestseller of the 70&rsquo;s.  While we were politically tired out and frustrated by Vietnam, Watergate, and Carter&rsquo;s &ldquo;malaise&rdquo;, Lindsey also got us thinking about premillenial, dispensational end times.  And a primary component of that movement, even though it&rsquo;s not often stated that way: fear.</p>
<p>Fear was, and still is, a huge motivator in that paradigm.  Fear of the coming one-world government.  Fear of The Antichrist.  Fear of &ldquo;the mark&rdquo;.  Fear that somehow we won&rsquo;t make God&rsquo;s &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and that we&rsquo;ll be left behind. Fear of the beheadings. Come on, folks, remember <em>A Thief In The Night</em>?  What other bad 1970&rsquo;s zombie film would ever get shown in high school church youth groups?</p>
<p>Then came 1980 and Ronald Reagan proclaimed that government was the problem, not the solution.  And the <em>Late, Great</em> adherents heard that and figured that any political movement that took us further away from that scary impending one-world government was a good thing.  And now for the past 30 years the Republican party, and, indeed, the entire Republican platform, has been considered the default &ldquo;right&rdquo; position for evangelical Christians in America.</p>
<p>Now, this is no sort of comprehensive analysis, but it&rsquo;s an interesting topic to think through. </p>
<p>Finally, a set of disclaimers so that I don&rsquo;t get kicked out of every group I&rsquo;ve ever belonged to:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like and admire a whole lot of what I know about and experienced of President Reagan.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure where I stand on the whole end-times thing.  I used to buy into the whole &ldquo;Left Behind&rdquo; scenario - let&rsquo;s face it, that&rsquo;s what I grew up in.  Today I&rsquo;m not so sure. Left Behind doesn&rsquo;t seem plausible, but I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced by the amillenial position, either. </li>
<li>Obviously not everyone that holds to the premillenial view hates the environment and/or is primarily motivated by fear</li>
<li>Obviously the Republican party holds some views that are good.  The Democrat party does, too.</li>
<li>I have some non-dispensational libertarian friends who are gonna tell me I&rsquo;m completely off base on this one.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>&hellip;but right now isn&rsquo;t it. After getting, by Becky&rsquo;s measurement, 11 inches of rain in the past 48 hours, our basement once again began taking on water. Looks like I should&rsquo;ve bumped that sump pump higher up the priority list. Once again I am thankful for neighbors on both sides who are willing to loan out their Shop Vacs. I am happy this year to have one shop vac that has a garden hose attachment so I don&rsquo;t have to carry it out to dump it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently 1:45 on Friday morning or so, and the Shop Vacs have been running continuously since around 4:20 Thursday afternoon. The water is slowing down some now, I&rsquo;m only having to go down and do some sopping up of puddles about every thirty minutes. The rest of the time I can just sit here and listen to the shop vacs run. You are never so ready for silence as you are after listening to three shop vacs run continuously for nine hours. Except for maybe after ten or eleven hours. :-)</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;ve listened to a couple of podcasts, watched two episodes of Arrested Development on Hulu, started a book, and annoyed anyone who was on Twitter to listen to my posts. If the water gets down to where I only need to check on it every hour, I&rsquo;m going to try to take some naps. Until then I guess I&rsquo;ll just hang out and drink another Diet Pepsi. I had already planned to take Friday off of work; I didn&rsquo;t plan to spend it this way, though. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of cleanup to do tomorrow.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So a couple of weeks ago <a href="/09/08/getting-rid-of-the-dish-the-nerd-post/">I talked about the nerd side of getting rid of the dish</a>. I&rsquo;m still playing around with the configuration some, but I think I&rsquo;m getting close to having a good usable solution. Becky keeps telling me &ldquo;just teach me how to use it once it&rsquo;s all working&rdquo;, so I guess I should try to get to that point sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>But the other side of this is the why - why get rid of the Dish? Was it really just the $60/month we were spending? (We bought enough new hardware it&rsquo;ll take us several months to break even.) Or is there more to it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit I didn&rsquo;t come to it in quite this direction; my push to switch things up was driven a lot by the desire to have an HD DVR option. But as I sat with my Dish remote in hand and flipped through the channels, I came to the realization that out of the 150 channels available for our viewing, we&rsquo;d never watched most of them. Most of them had programming that we couldn&rsquo;t care about in the least. For the most part we spent our tv-watching time tuned to one of our local network stations. The exceptions: ESPN for sports, Nick and Disney for some kids programming. Oh, and a backlog of Food Channel shows on the DVR that never really went away. So we talked about it, and we agreed there were other ways we could access the sorts of programming we really wanted to watch, and that we&rsquo;d be OK with missing the rest of it. So we cut the cord.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit there are things I&rsquo;m gonna miss. Monday Night Football on ESPN, for example. And the Cubs games on WGN. (OK, maybe it&rsquo;s good for my mental health to miss those&hellip;) But on the whole it&rsquo;s been a positive thing. What we&rsquo;ve eliminated is the mindless noise at night. We had a bad habit of just turning the TV on as we headed towards bed, watching the Cubs if they were on, but often just pulling up Sportscenter on ESPN and ignoring it while we read books and such before going to sleep. Without ESPN available, we&rsquo;ve either had to decide to watch something we specifically wanted to enjoy (we&rsquo;re catching up on 30 Rock) - or we just leave it off. And that&rsquo;s been a very good thing.</p>
<p>Back before we first got a Tivo, I wondered (a lot) whether the Tivo would be a good thing, or whether it would just cause us to watch <em>more</em> TV. It ended up being the former; the Tivo allowed us to watch the shows we wanted, <em>when</em> we wanted, without having to schedule our lives around the start times. (Oh, and we got 20% of our TV-watching lives back in skipped commercials.)</p>
<p>Before we got rid of the Dish, I wondered if we&rsquo;d just hate it and miss the programming. But I&rsquo;m pretty much believing now that we will make do just fine, and it will be an improvement overall in how we spend our time and allow ourselves to be entertained distracted.</p>
<p>Now, believe me, there are a couple of internet-based options that I&rsquo;ll definitely be keeping an eye on. If MLB.tv can ever get rid of their silly blackout restrictions (there are six teams that Iowans can&rsquo;t watch. most blacked-out state in the country!), I&rsquo;d subscribe in a heartbeat, and that&rsquo;d let me watch Cubs games again. And I&rsquo;d really love to get ESPN360.com, but that&rsquo;d require me to switch internet service providers&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not real keen on that idea, either. Ah well. I should just take the sage advice given by Bob the Tomato after he catches Larry the Cucumber overly engrossed in a TV show: &ldquo;maybe you should read a book.&rdquo; Yeah.</p>

			 <p>Kevin DeYoung just nails it in a post today. Titled <a href="http://www.revkevindeyoung.com/2009/08/on-mission-changing-world-and-not-being.html">&ldquo;On Mission, Changing the World, and Not Being Able to Do It All&rdquo;</a>, DeYoung challenges and encourages those of us who have the inclination to try to do it all, and who end up finding themselves age 30, cynical, and burned out. A few highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand there are lazy people out there (and believe me I can be lazy too sometimes). I understand there are lots of Christians in our churches sitting around doing nothing and they need to be challenged not to waste their life (seriously, I love that book and think Piper motivates for radical Christianity in the right way)&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&hellip;We need to be challenged, but in ways we can actually obey, not pummeled into law-induced submission until we finally feel completely rotten about most everything in life and admit we aren’t doing enough for the poor, the lost, the children, the elderly, the least of these, the&hellip;you fill in the blank. Is the goal of Christianity really to leave everyone feeling like terrible a parent, spouse, friend, or neighbor all the time?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I believe there will always be more indwelling sin in my life and I believe that I will never do a good deed perfectly. But I don’t believe God gives us impossible demands in which we should always feel like failures&hellip;.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When the pastor preaches on generosity the goal should not be to make every last person feel like a miserable, miserly wretch. Because unless you live in some Godforsaken locale, there are probably people in your church who practice generosity&hellip;. Sometimes, by God grace, we do get it right. The problem with “do more” Christianity is that no one is ever allowed to get it right. And the problem, ironically enough, with never allowing anyone to get it right, is that fewer people feel like getting it right really matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No doubt some Christians need to be shaken out of their lethargy. I try to do that every Sunday morning and evening. But there are also a whole bunch of Christians who need to be set free from their performance-minded, law-keeping, world-changing, participate-with-God-in-recreating-the-cosmos shackles. I promise you, some of the best people in your churches are getting tired. They don’t need another rah-rah pep talk. They don’t need to hear more statistics and more stories Sunday after Sunday about how bad everything is in the world. They need to hear about Christ’s death and resurrection. They need to hear how we are justified by faith apart from works of the law. They need to hear the old, old story once more. Because the secret of the gospel is that we actually do more when we hear less about all we need to do for God and hear more about all that God has already done for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="http://www.revkevindeyoung.com/2009/08/on-mission-changing-world-and-not-being.html">read the whole thing</a>. It&rsquo;s worth it. Really.</p>

			 <p>Nearly a week ago <a href="/09/08/taking-worship-seriously/">I wrote a piece here</a> wrestling with some concerns I&rsquo;ve had about Sunday morning worship. That post went past with relatively few comments, but this morning I had a conversation with a brother from Stonebridge who, without regard to the content of my concerns, asked why I hadn&rsquo;t just come to folks at church directly with my thoughts before publishing them on my blog. Furthermore, he let me know that there were feelings hurt by what I wrote.</p>
<p>We had a good conversation, one with which I&rsquo;ve been wrestling for the rest of the day. And while I don&rsquo;t feel like this was a situation where someone had wronged me and I should&rsquo;ve been following Matthew 18, in hindsight (don&rsquo;t you hate that word, hindsight? just its presence indicates that something was screwed up) I can understand that there could be folks who were hurt by what came across, despite my best intentions, as public criticism of them and their service at church.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I want to say just a few more things, and hope that they can settle the topic for now.</p>
<p>First: if my earlier post caused you hurt in any way, I apologize and ask for your forgiveness.</p>
<p>Second: I tried to say it in my earlier post, and I&rsquo;ll try to say it again here and hope that it comes through clearly: none of the criticism I was bringing was directed <em>at</em> any person. I certainly have enough experiences doing unprofitable things in church on which I can look back regretfully. I am fortunate that I have had people who noted those, corrected me in a spirit of love, and then encouraged me to get out there again. I want the same for Stonebridge, but I obviously handled the lines of communication poorly.</p>
<p>Finally: I&rsquo;ve only been at Stonebridge for less than a year, and have had precious little opportunity to get to know any of you, so I&rsquo;ll say something that in better circumstances hopefully wouldn&rsquo;t need said: the last thing I desire is to cause disunity within the Body. My only desire is that God be more glorified in each one of us, individually, and in all of us, corporately, with each passing day.</p>
<p>I earnestly yearn to chew on these topics with you in the days to come.</p>

Now, we&rsquo;re not giving up television altogether; we&rsquo;re just switching to a setup that will let us record and playback over-the-air TV, and giving up the paid stuff. There are a couple of sides to this, so I&rsquo;ll make it a couple of posts. This is the nerd post. You have been forewarned.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong> The Dish DVR we are replacing allowed us to record shows and watch them on either of our two TV locations, one downstairs in the family room, the other our little 13&quot; standard-def TV in our bedroom. We don&rsquo;t watch the upstairs one <em>that</em> much, but it is very handy to keep around for times when the girls want to watch a show, and for in the mornings when they&rsquo;re awake but we want to sleep in some. :-) We didn&rsquo;t have HD through Dish Network; I really wanted HD. Oh, and I&rsquo;d really like to still be able to watch some Cubs games. That&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p><strong>What We Ended Up With: Downstairs</strong></p>
<p>To go with the 42&quot; Vizio LCD TV downstairs we invested in a relatively-inexpensive tower PC. It&rsquo;s got a dual-core Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM (I know, I know, the 32-bit OS won&rsquo;t use all 4, but that was the stock configuration), a 1TB hard drive, and lots of room to expand. It came with Windows Vista Basic (ick); I upgraded it to Windows 7 RC, and have preordered a regular Win 7 license for it. Add a Windows Media Center remote, and it works pretty smoothly. A little noisier than I&rsquo;d like, but tolerable. This machine is our primary recording unit.</p>
<p>For an OTA tuner, I got a <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun">HDHomeRun networked tuner</a>. If there&rsquo;s one piece of this system that I&rsquo;m most happy with, it&rsquo;s the HDHomeRun. It&rsquo;s got dual tuners in it. Basically, you plug in your OTA antenna and your ethernet to the back of the tuner, and you&rsquo;re done. There&rsquo;s a small piece of software to install, but then Windows Media Center (and EyeTV on the Mac) pick it up with no trouble whatsoever. (Supposedly XBMC in Windows will handle the HDHomeRun, too, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to get it to work.)</p>
<p>The final component downstairs is an old tower (I forget the specs) running Ubuntu. I mostly use it as a place to save backups; there is just north of 1TB of disk space in it. I&rsquo;ve also got some recorded TV stored on it which gets served up to the other computers on the network.</p>
<p><strong>What We Ended Up With: Upstairs</strong></p>
<p>Our little friend the Mac Mini moved upstairs. To go with it, I found a Dell 22&quot; 1920x1080 LCD display on sale cheap. While we do have <a href="http://www.elgato.com">EyeTV</a> installed, and could record from upstairs, the limited HDD space on the Mini (100GB) has me recording downstairs instead. (Yeah, I could do some fun AppleScripting to move files to a different machine once they are done recording&hellip; but that&rsquo;s more work than I wanted right now.) The Mini is running XBMC for playback, and in the event we want to watch something live upstairs, we switch over to EyeTV. Not as elegant as I&rsquo;d like, but it works pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>What We Ended Up With: The Headaches</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge in this setup is that I&rsquo;m the idiot who&rsquo;s running three different OSs among my three computers. Oh, and also running a beta OS on the Windows box. So Windows 7 Media Center records OTA TV into a new file format (.wtv). WTV files aren&rsquo;t yet supported by the FFmpeg codec, which means XBMC won&rsquo;t play them. Fortunately, W7 provides a WTV-to-DVRMS converter, and FFmpeg <em>does</em> support DVRMS. So, I&rsquo;ve got a little nightly batch file that runs to convert all of the day&rsquo;s WTV recordings to DVRMS and file them off in appropriate directories in the shared library area.</p>
<p>Sooner or later the available toolset will catch up with the Windows 7 WTV format, at which point things like commercial skipping and direct playback in XBMC will be available, smoothing things out a bit. For now, though, we&rsquo;ve got a workable solution that records the shows we want to watch and lets us watch them in either of our two desired locations, and the ability to get rid of a monthly bill from Dish for a bunch of channels we never watch.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>OK, so it&rsquo;s entirely possible that at the ripe age of 32 I&rsquo;ve just become an old curmudgeon, but in the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve had a couple of experiences at church that cause me to wonder just how seriously we take this thing we call Sunday morning worship.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ll put some caveats at the front. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be talking about Stonebridge. Yes, I expect that there are people from Stonebridge who will read this. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to ask some questions that will sound critical. So up front let me say this isn&rsquo;t about any one person, or any one service, or any one topic, but rather it&rsquo;s about the things I&rsquo;ve seen, and about the mindset I think it reveals.</p>
<p>Experience #1: two weeks ago we ended the service with a great sermon from James, and started it with a good set of worship songs that were full of the Gospel - solid stuff. But the worship team had barely time to get off the stage, and the music had barely faded, before we were treated to one of the church staff dressed up in a superhero costume - complete with mask and cape and theme music! - to give us an announcement about an upcoming event. Hope you didn&rsquo;t want time to reflect on what you&rsquo;d just sung about. You weren&rsquo;t going to get it.</p>
<p>Experience #2: this morning at church was &ldquo;Family Sunday&rdquo;, which means that there was no Sunday School for the kids - the whole family got to sit in church together. Then, after three worship songs, the children&rsquo;s pastor was tasked with giving the message. First came a pseudo-introduction with a scripted &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; to give an announcement about a women&rsquo;s event. Then came the actual sermon from James, and it felt more like a gimmick than a sermon. There was a very distracting, ever-louder ticking clock in the background (for effect!) and at the end of three short points, during what seemed like a conclusion, the ticking finally stopped, and the pastor cut off the sermon mid-sentence and walked off the stage. And just like that, we were done.</p>
<p>Now yes, I know this morning was an attempt to be dramatic and illustrate the sermon point. But I&rsquo;m afraid that what people are left remembering this afternoon isn&rsquo;t the point from James 4, but rather the awkward way everyone sat and looked at each other as the pastor walked off, as my daughter asked &ldquo;is church over?&rdquo;. She was confused, too. And yes, Laura, church was over. We ended up spending more time driving to and from church than we did actually in the service this morning.</p>
<p>I fear that experiences like these reveal that we don&rsquo;t value enough the experience of Sunday worship. Yes, we show value to the Gospel in the songs we sing - but we don&rsquo;t value them enough to give folks time to meditate on the great riches of God&rsquo;s grace after singing. Instead, we distract them with superheroes in tights. Yes, we value and encourage the Sunday morning gathering, but then we allow gimmickry to replace Gospel proclamation, and send people home early, wondering &ldquo;what was that?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I remarked to my wife on the way home that, on a spectrum with stodgy and boring but solid on one end, and flashy, cool, and vapid on the other, our current church home is one or two ticks further toward the flashy end than I&rsquo;m quite comfortable with. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I have great respect for a lot of people there, and have regularly heard the Gospel from the pulpit. But times like these past few weeks leave me wondering if our lip service to the Gospel isn&rsquo;t quite being backed up with the sort of Sunday morning gravity that it deserves.</p>

			 <p>As my Twitter stream revealed over the weekend, it turned out to be a busy weekend, but not quite in the ways we had anticipated.</p>
<p>Becky has been wishing for a new refrigerator for a while now - something newer, bigger, and, well, if it had ice and water in the door, that&rsquo;d be awesome. So Friday afternoon someone at work posted a fridge for sale that seemed to fit the bill. Lightly used, newer, 40% bigger than our current one, and yeah, ice and water in the door. At a good price.</p>
<p>So Saturday morning we drove down to take a look at it. The fridge was in great shape, a good deal, but there was one minor issue: the thing was one inch too tall to fit underneath the cabinet in the kitchen. We thought on it for a while, looked at some other refrigerators at Lowe&rsquo;s and Sears, and realized that anything we ended up getting that was much bigger than our existing fridge would be too tall. So, after looking a bit at the small cabinet over the fridge, we decided to rip it out.</p>
<p>For not being the carpenter/handyman in the family, it came out pretty quickly and easily. I did manage to poke one small hole in the plaster, but it can be patched. I saved all the trim for reuse, and in the end we don&rsquo;t lose much usable storage space. That was step one.</p>
<p>Step two was to figure out how to move the new-to-use fridge up from Swisher to our place in Hiawatha. I put a plea out on Twitter and Facebook and got a response from a friend who could borrow a truck (thanks, Bridget!). It took checking three places before I found a utility dolly to rent, but finally it all came together and Sunday afternoon we moved in our new refrigerator.</p>
<p>Steps three and four can be given a little more time. Step three is to get the water line hooked up. Hopefully I can get that done today. Step four means we need to get the plaster patched, get the trim put back up, and get things painted. I&rsquo;ll post a few pictures when I get a chance.</p>
<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t the way I expected to spend my weekend, but I was able to put some tasks off and it worked out well. Now I just have to get the lawn mowed before we start losing small children in that jungle.</p>

<li>Slow-ish week turns into busy weekend. Lots of family in town, softball tournament, leading worship. Fun, but busy.</li>
<li>Oh, the occasion for all the family visiting: Laura turns 5 on Monday. Hard to believe I&rsquo;ve been a parent for five years now.</li>
<li>No matter how cool the gong is on &ldquo;The Great Gate of Kiev&rdquo;, the solo piano version of <em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em> is far and away superior to the orchestrated version.</li>
<li>Just when I think my homebrew DVR is all working and I&rsquo;m ready to blog about it, something else isn&rsquo;t working quite right. I&rsquo;ll be installing the Windows 7 Release Candidate tonight.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been flexing my web design muscles again a bit this week and it&rsquo;s kinda fun.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m down 7 or so pounds in the #20lbchallenge this month. This weekend&rsquo;s meal plans will be a challenge to that accomplishment. (Two months to go!)</li>

			 <p>Mostly to save my Tweeps from a half-dozen tweets venting my frustration.</p>
<p>I ordered a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010Y414Q/">HDHomeRun networked tuner</a> and a chunk of ethernet cable from Amazon on Friday morning, June 12. The tuner was ordered from Amazon proper; the cable from whichever of their providers had it the cheapest. I opted for Amazon&rsquo;s super-saver free shipping, both to save the $6 and because I didn&rsquo;t have enough $$$ on the gift card I was using to pay for shipping.</p>
<p>Additionally, I ordered a RAM upgrade for my Mac Mini from newegg.com on Tuesday evening, June 16. It came with free shipping.</p>
<p>Now, as to arrival times.</p>
<p>The network cable shipped the same day I ordered it, and arrived in the mail on the 16th. Snappy response, well done to the Amazon retailer.</p>
<p>The RAM shipped from Newegg on Wednesday June 17th, and arrived this morning via USPS. 5 days, including the weekend. Not bad.</p>
<p>Amazon finally got around to announcing that my tuner had shipped on the evening of Tuesday the 16th. So it took them three full business days to even get around to shipping it. And the USPS tracking number they gave me says that yes, they entered the tracking number into the system on the evening of the 16th. However, the arrival scan for the package doesn&rsquo;t show up until <strong>the afternoon of June 19th</strong>. So between the time they boxed it up and the time they actually got it to USPS was <em>another</em> three business days.</p>
<p>Now they&rsquo;re telling me that the anticipated delivery date to my home in Iowa (from, per the tracking info, someplace in Kentucky) is not until Thursday, June 25th - a full two weeks after I ordered it, and <strong>a full nine days after they told me it shipped</strong>. I know the USPS isn&rsquo;t the fastest carrier, but hey, that&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
<p>I have had better shipping service from Amazon in the past - maybe this is just a fluke. Or maybe it&rsquo;s part of a strategy to dissuade customers from actually choosing their free shipping option. Either way, it&rsquo;s pretty awful.</p>
<p>End rant. Carry on.</p>

			 <p>This morning Shaun Inman pushed out (with <a href="http://twitter.com/shauninman/statuses/2278304910">notice via Twitter</a>) version 1.01 of the <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever° feed reader</a>. First of all, major kudos to Shaun for the auto-updater built in to Fever°. (Yes, I&rsquo;ll go ahead and conform to the official naming of this tool, adding the little degree symbol to the end.) Once Shaun pushes the update out, Fever° will auto-update within 24 hours. Or, you can do an instant update from the menu. Very cool, very very simple. (Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://feedafever.com/todone.txt">changelog for V1.01</a>.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what all kicked loose, because it seemed like some feeds started working even before I pulled down the 1.01 update, but since updating Fever° is kicking butt. The scrolling issues I reported in V1.0 are all fixed, and the feeds appear to all be pulling in nicely. I&rsquo;m gonna run it side-by-side with Google Reader for the day to make sure they seem like they&rsquo;re catching the same stuff, and if Fever° passes that test, I&rsquo;ll be saying adios to GR for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Now if I could just get him to set up some sort of referral bonuses&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had a <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a> install up and running for 24 hours now, and I&rsquo;ve gotta compliment Shaun for working through the emailed bug reports - he responded back twice, once to acknowledge my email, and a second to ask if I had any tips on reproducing one of the errors I reported. ( I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce it either.)</p>
<p>Where I am seeing problems, though, is in the feed updates. I thought it seemed kinda slow today activity-wise, so I just went and opened up Google Reader. Sure enough, GR has nearly 1000 unread items, just from the last 24 hours. I&rsquo;ve seen maybe 200 or so in Fever today. I spot-checked a couple of feeds, and yeah, they&rsquo;re missing. For instance, Andrew Sullivan over on <a href="http://theatlantic.com">theatlantic.com</a> has at least a dozen updates since this morning&hellip; but Fever, even though it says it&rsquo;s refreshing every 15 minutes, doesn&rsquo;t have anything newer than 16 hours old.</p>
<p>My one fear with host-it-yourself apps like this is that all of the connectivity issues get thrown back upon the user (and webhost) to resolve - i.e. if there&rsquo;s no other discernible bug, maybe it&rsquo;s just something with your server. In this case, though, I think there&rsquo;s something else going on.</p>
<p>Anybody else have any Fever reports, good or bad?</p>

			 <p>Twitter and the blogs have been abuzz today over <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">Shaun Inman</a>&rsquo;s newest creation, called <a href="http://www.feedafever.com">Fever</a>. Some of you may be familiar with Shaun&rsquo;s previous creation, <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, a really nifty blog stats package that you host yourself. Inman is on familiar ground this time with Fever, creating a spiffy feed reader, full of AJAX-y goodness, suitable for hosting on your own website.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a regular Google Reader user for years now, occasionally trying out other readers&hellip; there was that fling with Feedlounge, before it went under, and occasional dalliances with NewsGator&rsquo;s line of readers&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve always gone back to Google Reader. I took a look at Inman&rsquo;s demo of Fever, though, over on <a href="http://www.feedafever.com">feedafever.com</a>, and knew it was time to give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>Does the world really need another feed reader, anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a new RSS feed reader is no simple task. Taking accepted existing designs and improving on them requires creativity and good ideas about usability. Inman is on the right track here. But aside from the UI design, Inman has created a dual-purpose tool. On one hand, Fever is a traditional feed reader. You subscribe, it updates the feeds, you read. On the other hand, though, Fever is something like your own personal Digg. You can subscribe to all those noisy feeds, those linkdump feeds that occasionally have something interesting in them, and identify them as &ldquo;Sparks&rdquo;. Then Fever will aggregate them, pick out the hot topics, and present them to you in a &ldquo;Hot&rdquo; category, grouping them around a specific topic or link. This, to me, looks like the really slick part of Fever.</p>
<p>After the jump: my experience with installing Fever, importing my feed list, and some thoughts on usability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase and Installation</strong></p>
<p>Like Mint before it, Inman&rsquo;s pricing model is similar to that of off-the-shelf software: pay once, install on your own machine. In this case, your own webhost. $30 buys you a license which is tied to a specific domain name.</p>
<p>Installation is ridiculously easy. You download a little &ldquo;tester&rdquo; zip file, unzip it and upload it to your domain, and visit the one page that it creates. The tester does some cursory checks to ensure that adequate versions/settings of PHP and SQL are present, and then does a database check to ensure your database is set up with adequate permissions. <strong>A word of warning here:</strong> pay attention: the database settings you use to test here will be used to install Fever should you choose to purchase it. This wasn&rsquo;t clear to me when I did the install. Fortunately it didn&rsquo;t become an issue.</p>
<p>Once your server has passed all the tests, you are given a link that will take you back to feedafever.com, where you can drop your $30 via Paypal for the license. Once you pay up, you are given a license key which you can then copy and paste back into Fever. Normally, at this point, you&rsquo;d be expecting to have to download a full install, upload it, do some manual configuration, and so on, right? Not with Fever, though. Once you give it the license key, Fever silently installs the full setup (about 900 KB of files) and you&rsquo;re up and running. Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Importing Feeds</strong></p>
<p>Next I went over to Google Reader and dumped my OPML file. I&rsquo;m a heavy user, probably not quite in the &lsquo;power user&rsquo; category yet, but the OPML had 454 feeds, about 100KB worth of XML. It took about two clicks to suck it into fever, and the import went very smoothly. Compared to the import times when I&rsquo;ve tried using FeedDemon, FeedLounge, or (shudder) Bloglines, Fever screamed through the import.</p>
<p>You have the option of keeping all your categories from the OPML or choosing not to when you import. I did keep my categories, but found a small issue with that choice later on - there is a bug (design choice?) that keeps the category list from scrolling. So, I can only see about half of my lists. Not a fatal issue, but something that needs fixed.</p>
<p>Once the feeds were imported, Fever started kicking off updates of all the feeds. This just takes a little while. If you want to set up a cron job on your server, you can have Fever pull in updates every 15 minutes &lsquo;round the clock. If not, Fever will update every 15 minutes when you have it open in a browser. I have yet to set up the cron job - we&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>General Usage</strong></p>
<p>Fever is set up with the power user in mind. Keyboard shortcuts are built-in and intuitive; they allow you to do navigation, switch between two-pane and three-pane views (shown below), and the space bar lets you jump one article at a time, or, if it&rsquo;s a long article, one page at a time. Slick.</p>
<p>Fever looks great, too. The overall layout feels a lot like Google Reader, even more like its Greasemonkey-enhanced alter ego Helvetireader. Group and feed lists are on the side, and you have the choice of showing or hiding unread counts.</p>
<p>When you go to the Hot category, Fever assigns &ldquo;temperatures&rdquo; to the topics and presents the links in grouped form. For example, in the shot below, &ldquo;Sojurn Community Church&rdquo; is a hot topic among my feeds, and the half-dozen links discussing it are listed below. Clicking on any of them opens the actual blog article in a new tab. The &ldquo;temperatures&rdquo; are the one thing I&rsquo;m actually a little unsure about. While they are a nice way of showing &ldquo;hot&rdquo; topics, having the temperature listed there in a BIG font seems a little big cheesy. We&rsquo;ll have to see how it stands the test of time.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>I have yet to hear from my webhost and friend Geof complaining that the server&rsquo;s taking a beating, so I&rsquo;m hoping Fever has a smart backend that won&rsquo;t tie up the server. Right now the SQL database is taking about 13 MB of space. I&rsquo;m a bit curious to see at what point Fever starts pruning old feed items and how large my database might grow to be.</p>
<p><strong>Bugs and Quirks</strong></p>
<p>I do have a few gripes with Fever that I hope will get ironed out in short order. (Note: Fever automatically checks the server for updates to itself! Awesome!) The first is the feed editing dialog. (Click on the image to see it full-sized.) Maybe it&rsquo;s just because I have a lot of groups defined, but when I bring up the feed editing dialog, the bottom of the box is off-screen, with no way to scroll to it. (This is running 1280x800 resolution with Firefox fully maximized.) Fortunately, if I F11 to full screen view, the whole thing just barely fits on the screen. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be stuck.</p>
<p>The other general gripe is the mechanism for sorting feeds into groups. As I said earlier, I had a <em>lot</em> (50?) of categories defined in my OPML file, so I decided I&rsquo;d consolidate things a bit. Creating a new group is easy; picking the feeds for it is less so. Once you decide to edit a group, you are given a scroll box with your entire list of feeds. It&rsquo;s a multi-select box, which means you better make sure you hold down the Control key while you scroll through and select the ones you want - otherwise you&rsquo;ll be starting over. Ugh. Suggestion for Mr. Inman: use check boxes. Or even better, figure out a way to drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>As a general note, there is an iPhone/iPod Touch interface built in for Fever. To this point, though, it&rsquo;s not liking my Fever login&hellip; not sure why. Gotta keep trying.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>All in all, Fever is a welcome addition to the world of feed readers. For a tool I&rsquo;m gonna use every day, I&rsquo;m willing to spend a few bucks, and I think in this case Fever is $30 well spent. I&rsquo;m looking forward to having a few days to get things organized, and for a few bugs to get sorted out, and I may well have a new favorite feed reader. Time will tell.</p>

			 <p>I think it really hit me when I saw the dirt bike. I hadn&rsquo;t seen that dirt bike in years, but I remembered the story behind it. It had been bought cheap, fixed up in a garage, and when finally complete, was brought to a party at a friends' house in the country. The owner rode it first, then handed the helmet to my wife. She proceeded to take it on a loop of the property, then lost control and ended up riding the thing directly into the corner of a limestone barn. Becky recovered within a couple of weeks from her spill, but when I saw the dirt bike sitting out waiting to be loaded into a moving trunk on Monday afternoon, I realized it had set for the last seven years with a bent rim waiting to be repaired.</p>
<p>On one hand you could say &ldquo;come on, a bent rim, that&rsquo;s an easy fix, why has it taken so long to fix it?&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;d be right. But having been friends with the owners of that bike for the past ten years, I know the stories of how life has intervened. Her chronic illness. His serious infection that cost him the vision in one eye. (No small thing for a pilot!) The business start-up. Later, the provision of a flying job. (Can you believe they let a one-eyed pilot fly 747s? I can.) The births of two delightful children. The struggles and joys of families, friends, church. I can very well understand why that dirt bike still has a bent rim. (On a side note: I wonder what projects I have sitting in the garage that still need completed&hellip;)</p>
<p>Monday afternoon I helped load the contents of these friends' house into a long moving van. Assuming all went well yesterday, they drove the eight hours and arrived in Indiana where they are moving to be closer to family. With his gone-17-days-at-a-time work schedule, it makes sense for them, but we still hate to see them go.</p>
<p>Life has chapters, but there are no chapter titles. We can only turn the pages and see where this next chapter takes us. I look forward to an upcoming chapter that sees us visiting those friends in Indiana, and I have only one request for them: once you get the bike fixed, let somebody other than my wife ride it first.</p>

			 <p>If my previous posts in which I declared my support for Obama and for civilly-recognized gay marriage weren&rsquo;t enough to convince my church friends that I have become a heathen leftist Commie pinko, I&rsquo;ll probably do it with this post. Why? Because I&rsquo;m going to be mildly critical of Fox News and of those who blindly follow it.</p>
<p>Yesterday I linked to a <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/05/i-was-wrong-about-sotomayor-sp.html">Rod Dreher column entitled &ldquo;I was wrong about Sotomayor speech&rdquo;</a>. (Yeah, there&rsquo;s an article missing somewhere in that sentence, but live with it.) To catch anyone up who hasn&rsquo;t heard about it, the controversial statement from Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was made in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/us/politics/15judge.text.html?pagewanted=all">a 2002 speech</a> at Cal Berkeley, where she said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was (as one might expect) immediately a lot of noise made by conservative groups like the <a href="http://www.judicialnetwork.com/">Judicial Confirmation Network</a> and bloggers (I&rsquo;ll link Michelle Malkin here as <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2009/05/26/scotus-pick-sonia-sotomayor/">just one example</a>), and when I was on the treadmill at the gym for 30 minutes on Tuesday afternoon, Fox News host Glenn Beck had that quote up on the screen seemingly every minute of his show. And let&rsquo;s face it: as a stand-alone statement, it seems bad. It&rsquo;s not the sort of thing that a &ldquo;judges apply the law, they don&rsquo;t make it&rdquo; conservative like me likes to hear at all.</p>
<p>So back to that Dreher article I linked. Conservative columnist Rod Dreher candidly notes that after reading the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/us/politics/15judge.text.html?pagewanted=all">full text</a> of the speech in question, he says he is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;still a bit troubled by the remark, but not in any important way. Taken in context, the speech was about how the context in which we were raised affects how judges see the world, and that it&rsquo;s unrealistic to pretend otherwise. Yet &ndash; and this is a key point &ndash; she admits that as a jurist, one is obligated to strive for neutrality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he quotes <em>another</em> passage from Sotomayor&rsquo;s speech, one that didn&rsquo;t ever make the screen at Fox News:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While recognizing the potential effect of individual experiences on perception, Judge Cedarbaum nevertheless believes that judges must transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law. Although I agree with and attempt to work toward Judge Cedarbaum&rsquo;s aspiration, I wonder whether achieving that goal is possible in all or even in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, that puts a whole different spin on things, doesn&rsquo;t it? All of a sudden Judge Sotomayor sounds a lot less like a radical legislate-from-the-bench sort of judge and more like an idealist who nonetheless understands the role of the judge in the three-branch governmental system.</p>
<p>At this point I have to put a disclaimer in, because just as <a href="/08/11/recognizing-the-civil-religious-disconnect-or-what-to-do-about-gay-marriage/">my support of civilly recognizing gay marriage</a> caused friends to think that I no longer believe homosexual behavior is sin, this post suggesting that Judge Sotomayor isn&rsquo;t quite as radical as Fox News suggests will cause some friends to think that I&rsquo;m soft on abortion. So here&rsquo;s the disclaimer. Judge Sotomayor does not appear to be the type of judge I&rsquo;d prefer to see picked for the Supreme Court. I much prefer the staunch conservative views of Justices Roberts and Scalia, and the late Chief Justice Rehnquist. And abortion remains a heinous sin. OK? Are we cool? So let&rsquo;s proceed.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing I want to get to in regard to Fox News: if you watch it and for a minute think that you&rsquo;re really getting a &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; view of the news, think again. Is it truly &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; to hammer on Sotomayor for the one line that sounds bad, without bringing in the other line from <em>the same speech</em> that balances things out?</p>
<p>So next you&rsquo;ll say to me &ldquo;OK, Chris, we&rsquo;ll admit that Fox News is biased towards the conservative viewpoint. But all the other networks are biased towards the liberal side, so why can&rsquo;t we have our one network?&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s OK, I guess, as long as you recognize the bias. Because, let&rsquo;s face it: if your only news source is Fox News, <em>you wouldn&rsquo;t even know they have a bias</em>. (Me personally? I don&rsquo;t watch TV news at all. But my news sources of choice should really be the topic of a separate blog post.)</p>
<p>So my plea to my friends this morning: read, watch, and listen widely. Think about things and come to your own conclusions. Don&rsquo;t just assume that if it shows up on Fox News, it&rsquo;s the gospel truth. (Don&rsquo;t assume that it isn&rsquo;t, either.) Be willing to see shades of grey in areas where there isn&rsquo;t a black-and-white standard. And be gracious and loving to all as you do it.</p>

			 <p>Last Sunday we visited <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge Park Church</a> for the morning service so Laura could participate in the AWANA recognition Sunday. (She&rsquo;s been a regular there in Cubbies even though we&rsquo;ve not been attending Noelridge for the past 18 months.) As we got ready to go Sunday morning, I noted to Becky that it was nearly ten years, to the day, since the first time we visited Noelridge, immediately after we moved to Iowa.</p>
<p><strong>That was then&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Ten years. Nearly a third of our lives to this point. In one sense I look back and say &ldquo;wow, time flies&rdquo;; but in another sense I look back and remember all that we have lived through in those ten years, and it does, indeed, seem like a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ten years ago we had been married less than a year, two kids moving across the country to an unfamiliar city and state. Now we&rsquo;re both into our thirties, have three kids of our own, and Iowa feels a lot like home.</li>
<li>In ten years we&rsquo;ve been from an old rental farmhouse in the country that leaked heat like a sieve in the winter, to unintentionally renting a house in town from the most notorious landlord in Cedar Rapids, to owning our own place, to starting to wonder when/if we&rsquo;ll outgrow our own place and have to look for something else.</li>
<li>In ten years we&rsquo;ve gone from being young newcomers at a <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">church</a> to being in and <a href="/06/09/things-are-changing/">out</a> of leadership, to then <a href="/07/09/changes-in-the-works/">dreaming up and leading</a> a <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">church plant</a>, and then finally <a href="http://www.chrishubbs.com/tag/church-search/">being led away from the church plant</a> to participate in <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com">a different church</a>.</li>
<li>In ten years we&rsquo;ve gone from knowing no one here to having made a lot of friends. Then it&rsquo;s just sad to see them go. We were sad to see the Majerle&rsquo;s move to Minnesota five years ago, though we were glad we could buy their house. :-) This summer, particularly, feels like the end of an era, with the Garner&rsquo;s moving to Indiana and the Finley&rsquo;s moving to Texas. I guess now we have new places to visit on vacations.</li>
<li>In ten years Becky&rsquo;s job description has changed from &ldquo;CAD drafter at a stone quarry&rdquo; to &ldquo;wood shop worker&rdquo; to &ldquo;mom of one&rdquo; to &ldquo;<a href="/06/03/short-on-sleep-but-full-of-joy/">mom of two</a>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<a href="/09/03/its-a-girl/">mom of three</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m pretty sure she likes her current job description best.</li>
<li>In ten years my job description has been more consistent, changing only from &ldquo;software engineer&rdquo; to &ldquo;software team lead&rdquo; to &ldquo;software certification specialist&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m hoping to make the certification thing a long-term gig. Hopefully this fall it&rsquo;ll all come together.</li>
<li>In ten years I&rsquo;ve gone from being a smooth-cheeked youngster with plastered-down hair to slightly-less-plastered-down hair to a beard and shaved head. I&rsquo;ve had this look going for three years now, and think I&rsquo;ll be keeping it for a while. Sooner or later I won&rsquo;t have to shave the head as much.</li>
<li>In ten years Becky is still the beautiful woman who took my arm and came to Iowa sight-unseen. She&rsquo;s still kicking butt on the softball field every summer, growing yummy stuff in the garden, keeping our household running smoothly, and making our home a place I always want to come home to, and never want to leave.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can only imagine the changes I&rsquo;ll have to reflect on if I&rsquo;m still writing on this blog or something like it ten years from now&hellip; teenaged kids, middle age&hellip; I can wait. But if the next ten years are as rich and full and wonderful as the past ten have been&hellip; I will (continue to) be a man most richly blessed.</p>
<p><strong>This is now&hellip;</strong></p>

			 <p>This week business took me on my second-ever cross-the-border trip, once again to Canada, though this time to a part of Canada (Toronto) that felt much less alien then last time (Montreal). Something about them still speaking English in Ontario makes it a little more comfortable.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there wasn&rsquo;t much time for sight-seeing as we sandwiched a day of customer meetings and round-trip travel into a 48-hour window, but I <em>did</em> get the chance to finally meet, in person, some &ldquo;weird internet friends&rdquo;: <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel">Dan</a>, <a href="http://butterflyjar.wordpress.com/">Laura</a>, and Wally. First, a little photographic evidence, then, the narrative.</p>
<p>Dan and Laura:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Wally, Dan, and me:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It should come as no real surprise by now to anyone that reads this blog that I have a group of &ldquo;weird internet friends&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve had some visit in our home, and met up with others in Minneapolis, Nashville, Lincoln, and Charlotte. Each time I&rsquo;ve found them to be decent, enjoyable people, and we&rsquo;ve had great times visiting. I had a little extra anticipation this time, though; Dan and I had hit it off so well online that I figured our in-person meeting would either be brilliant or amazingly awkward.</p>
<p>This meeting fell into the brilliant category. Without minimizing my enjoyment of Wally&rsquo;s company at all, I have to say that Dan and Laura felt less like new acquaintances and more like long-lost family. We had a fantastic time visiting, eating dinner, and drinking coffee far too late into the evening.</p>
<p>While it is a nearly 12-hour drive from Toronto to Cedar Rapids, I extended the invitation to Dan and Laura that I&rsquo;d extend to any of my weird internet friends (and you know who you are) - any time you have a long weekend and want to come visit, we have a spare bedroom, an expandable dining room table, and all the excitement of Eastern Iowa for you to enjoy on your visit. Hope to see you soon.</p>

<li>Monday road trip to Nashville was awesome. Saw some friends, made some new ones, saw a great concert. (Geof recorded it and you can <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ao-20090427-mp3s">download MP3s</a>.)</li>
<li>Driving 1300 miles in two days will make you a little bit saddle sore.</li>
<li>Work has been somewhere between ridiculously crazy and insanely crazy for the past couple of weeks. Looks like it&rsquo;ll stay that way until the middle of May.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be traveling to Toronto for work in a couple of weeks. Looking forward to finally meeting <a href="http://www.rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Dan</a> and <a href="http://butterflyjar.wordpress.com/">Laura</a> in person.</li>
<li>Listened to about 15 hours of D. A. Carson sermons/lectures on my road trip. That guy is an amazing teacher.</li>
<li>At the moment I&rsquo;m listening to Manchester Orchestra (which isn&rsquo;t a symphony orchestra, Dad, it&rsquo;s a rock band) and they&rsquo;re pretty darn good.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this afternoon I posted this thought to Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scary Thing #1 as an engineer: people who just want the magic words rather than wanting to understand the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My buddy Geof suggested on Facebook that I should take it easy on managers, but I let him know that no, I wasn&rsquo;t talking about a manager, I was talking about a fellow engineer. And so then I got to thinking.</p>
<p>Now, I work in the aviation industry. We have very strict regulations and processes we follow when we write embedded software, and for good reason. Let&rsquo;s face it, when you&rsquo;re next flying in an airplane, you&rsquo;d like to hope that we didn&rsquo;t screw up the code in your <a href="http://rockwellcollins.com/products/cs/br/avionics-systems/flight_displays/index.html">Flight Display</a> or your <a href="http://rockwellcollins.com/products/cs/br/avionics-systems/auto-flight/fcs4000/index.html">Autopilot</a> or your <a href="http://rockwellcollins.com/products/cs/br/avionics-systems/navigation/gps4000a/index.html">GPS</a>. So at the beginning of a development program we write a software development plan, where we explain in nauseating detail exactly how we&rsquo;re going to go about developing the software. The tools we&rsquo;re going to use, the processes we follow to review the code and fix any errors, the way we&rsquo;re going to test it, the whole nine yards.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re a new hire right out of college, I expect that you&rsquo;re going to be able to take that Development Plan and follow the processes we&rsquo;ve defined. And I don&rsquo;t really expect you to understand yet <em>why</em> we&rsquo;re doing it. But before too many years go by you have to make the step to get past understanding the &ldquo;what&rdquo; of the Development Plan and get to understanding the &ldquo;why&rdquo; we wrote it that way.</p>
<p>Sure, some training will help. Sit down and read a copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DO-178B">DO-178B</a> sometime when you get bored. And some mentoring along the way is very valuable. But eventually, if you&rsquo;re gonna turn into a really good engineer, you&rsquo;re gonna have to be able to think through it for yourself. <em>Hmmm&hellip;. Here&rsquo;s our regulatory objective. Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve done it in the past. But&hellip; we could do something different, it would be more efficient, and it would</em> still achieve the same root purpose_, which is what we&rsquo;re really after._</p>
<p>Because engineers, after all, are a pragmatic people. (We&rsquo;ll ignore the curmudgeons among us for a minute.) On the whole, their primary objective isn&rsquo;t simply following the book. They&rsquo;re more interested in finding an efficient, elegant solution that does it right and, in our industry, does it safe. Beyond that, if you&rsquo;ve got an idea, say so!</p>
<p>So this is my plea to my fellow engineers out there. (And yes, the fact that I&rsquo;m writing this at 8:30 on a Friday night is sad proof that I&rsquo;m an engineer.) Use your heads. Think about it. Start trying to understand the <em>why</em> and don&rsquo;t just be satisfied with the <em>what</em>. Eventually it&rsquo;ll start to make sense, and when it does, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to becoming a successful senior engineer.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a frustrating couple of weeks, but this does make the day cheerier: I just firmed up plans to road trip to Nashville on April 27 (less than two weeks from now!) to meet up with some friends (<a href="http://www.gfmorris.com">Geof Morris</a>, Mike Terry among others) and see <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2127580/">play a show</a> with full band at <a href="http://www.12thandporterlive.com">12th and Porter</a>.</p>

			 <p>That&rsquo;s the way my friend Steve used to describe it, and this week has been one of those weeks. Half my calendar at work has been meetings; each meeting seems to generate more tasks for me; the remaining non-meeting time doesn&rsquo;t seem to be sufficient to complete the tasks at a rate that will bring me anywhere close to keeping up.</p>
<p>Help is on the way, though: a loaner laptop to help me get work done <em>during</em> meetings, and a minion junior engineer who can be responsible for some of my lower-priority-yet-still-time-consuming tasks. Next week is still meeting-heavy, but I have hope that my group and I are making progress.</p>
<p>On the home front, we were able to keep Katie asleep long enough last night for Becky and I to blow off some steam on the new Wii. So far we&rsquo;ve only got the Wii Sports and Wii Fit, so we played a bunch of head-to-head sports. She quickly proved she could beat me at tennis, baseball, and golf. It&rsquo;s some small comfort that I can still take her in bowling, though. One of these days I&rsquo;m gonna pick up Mario Kart and <em>then</em> we&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s boss.</p>
<p>Now we approach Easter weekend, and it&rsquo;s gonna be the most relaxed Easter weekend we&rsquo;ve had since I don&rsquo;t know when. Saturday is the 8th (!) annual egg hunt out in Stone City at the Berberich&rsquo;s - will be so good to catch up with them. It&rsquo;s been far too long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a post on music floating around in my head that I&rsquo;m gonna try to get written this weekend, but until then, dear readers, be patient and put up with my automated link posts. Go read the articles if you&rsquo;re bored - they&rsquo;ve gotta be good before I&rsquo;ll link &lsquo;em. :-)</p>

			 <p>As a friend noted the other day, it&rsquo;s a bit of a weird feeling to know that you&rsquo;re driving only two to the hospital, but when you come home there will be three. But it&rsquo;s a great feeling, too, to finally leave the hospital and bring folks home. Becky and Katie were discharged on Sunday morning and came home to two excited sisters and two grandparents.</p>

<p>Since she came home there has been a steady stream of visitors: my brother Aaron and his wife Emily came down on Sunday for a few hours, my parents came down to visit today for the day, and my sister Rebecca and her roommate came down this afternoon and will head back tomorrow. Such excitement for such a small person! :-)</p>
<p>Katie was awake and hungry a good bit of the night last night and has then managed to sleep a good bit of the day today. Hopefully we can get her schedule switched around this week so we can get some better sleep&hellip; or, I should say, so Becky can get some better sleep; I&rsquo;m afraid I slept through most all of it last night.</p>
<p>Such a blessing to have a home with a beautiful wife and three beautiful little girls. God is good.</p>

			 <p>Back in college, <a href="http://www.letu.edu/opencms/opencms/_Academics/Arts-Science/english/faculty/batts.html">Dr. Batts</a> suggested a cheap date: a trip to Walmart. His rationale? First, go through the food side of the store and eat the free samples, then, go back to the electronics department and watch whatever movie is playing on the TVs.</p>
<p>Well, 10 years ago I guess they still did have food samples and movies on the TVs at Walmart; now the samples are gone and the TVs run perpetual advertising. But last night we still managed a pretty fantastic cheap date.</p>
<p>Dinner for two + dessert + tip at a nice Italian restaurant: $1 after gift card. Mario Kart on the Wii at Best Buy: free. Mocha and Decaf Sumatra at <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">Brewed Awakenings</a>: free thanks to a credit on my account.</p>
<p>Three hours out with Becky on a beautiful March evening: priceless.</p>
<p>(Of course, a couple more experiences with Mario Kart on a Wii will pretty much convince me that we need to buy one&hellip; which has the potential make the total financial impact of the evening a little bit more expensive.)</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;ve gotten to that point in Becky&rsquo;s pregnancy now where it&rsquo;s just a waiting game. The calendar is clear; the in-laws are here (and planning to stay until after the baby is born), the bags are packed. Heck, we even made a trial run to the hospital on Thursday morning when we had a bit of a false alarm. So now we wait.</p>
<p>Last time when we were playing the waiting game we ended up buying a minivan. We&rsquo;re still paying it off. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll do anything quite so expensive this time, but we might at least take advantage of the free babysitting and go out to dinner or watch a movie or something. The weather is great this week so we&rsquo;ll take lots of walks. And then we wait some more.</p>
<p>Actually, if the baby were born on Wednesday or so of this week the timing would be pretty great - nothing like having a built-in excuse to take vacation days from work during the opening weekend of the NCAA tournament. :-) Not that basketball would be my, um, priority or anything.</p>
<p>I am slowly learning patience whether I like it or not.</p>

			 <p>Last week I accepted a position in a new group here at work. It&rsquo;s a group I&rsquo;ve worked <em>with</em> for several years, and I knew I wanted to work <em>in</em> that group if the opportunity arose. The opportunity <em>did</em> arise, and I got the position. While the exact transfer date has yet to be settled upon (sometime today we&rsquo;ll get it figured out, I hope), it&rsquo;s just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Which leads me to this dilemma. I have two options for my new office. (I&rsquo;m not quite senior enough to get my own full-sized office yet&hellip; one more engineering grade to go.)</p>
<p><strong>Choice 1:</strong> share a two-person office with a co-worker, getting the end of the office near the door. One desk, one table, file drawer.</p>
<p><strong>Choice 2:</strong> get my own little mini-office. Basically it&rsquo;s standard cubicle-based office furniture inside a room with a door. It&rsquo;s not very big, but it would be my first-ever &ldquo;own office&rdquo;.</p>
<p>One thing that makes the choice easier: my new department will be moving to a different building within the next couple of months, so my choice really only impacts the near term. What think ye, friends and readers?</p>

First is the book&rsquo;s size - usually no larger than 5 by 8 inches. Second is the cover art - typically a scenic vista or natural landscape, meant to soothe and inspire. I didn&rsquo;t get a look at the cover art before I agreed to accept a free copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Echo-Within-Finding-Your-Calling/dp/1400074347%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1400074347">The Echo Within</a></em> from Waterbrook Press and review it on my blog, but as soon as I pulled it out of the envelope, I started to wonder. Is this gonna be another one of those fluffy inspirational books?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.robertbensonwriter.com/">Robert Benson</a> is the author of over a dozen books, all of which he describes on his website as being about one thing: &ldquo;paying attention&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.robertbensonwriter.com/bio">Says Benson</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I write about paying attention for the things that can point us to the Sacred in our lives. About the longings that we have for home and community and a sense of belonging. About practice and ritual and work and contemplation and the way that such things can be constant reminders of who we are and who we are to become.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in this little volume, as you might guess from its title, Benson urges us to listen to &ldquo;the echo within&rdquo; - the little voice within ourselves that gives us some inclination of choices we should make, directions we should take, things we should believe. In the first chapter he describes it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am coming to believe that the small voice within me is an echo of the Voice that is still speaking the incarnate word that I am here to become, an echo of the Voice that spoke us all into being, an echo of the Voice that spoke all that is alive.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Sometimes we are hesitant to trust that small voice within us because we think it is just ourselves doing the talking&hellip; because we have heard a similar voice inside us say things that are hurtful and angry and hateful, to ourselves and about others.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We must learn to listen deeper and deeper, seeking out the true voice within us that echoes the Voice of the One Who made us&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The fact that the Voice that calls to us often sounds like our own is not something to be mistrusted or feared. It is a sign of how close God is to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benson has some good insights in <em>The Echo Within</em> about recognizing the talents, inclinations, and desires that God has built into us - sometimes we do tend to make this whole &ldquo;God&rsquo;s leading&rdquo; thing more difficult than it needs to be - but on the whole Benson strays just a little too far in the &ldquo;listen to your inner voice&rdquo; direction, with no balance of recognizing the Truth that is revealed to us in Scripture.</p>
<p>For the person running weary and needing some quiet encouragement, <em>The Echo Within</em> might be a nice little volume to pick up. Read and consider it with discernment, though. That inner voice might be God, but then again, it might not be.</p>

			 <p>Laziness, and no big topics to contemplate. Put those two together and you end up with my blog as of late. Sorry folks. So, a make-up post of sorts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only four more weeks until the baby is due. I&rsquo;m sure we don&rsquo;t really understand quite how life will change going from 2 to 3 kids, but we&rsquo;ll figure it out. Excitement is building among all the residents of our little home. (Well, maybe not among the cats.)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re now several weeks in to our first <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com">Stonebridge</a> small group and we&rsquo;re really enjoying it. It&rsquo;s fun to make some new friends. I did get a few weird looks last night when I briefly touched on <a href="/08/11/recognizing-the-civil-religious-disconnect-or-what-to-do-about-gay-marriage/">the whole gay marriage thing</a>, but my lament about Christians being known more for their support of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_%282008%29">Prop 8</a> than for their love for their neighbor was well-received.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m applying for a new position here at work - a fantastic opportunity. Not going to say too much about it here just now, but I have an interview tomorrow at 1 pm.</li>
<li>Another thing that&rsquo;s sneaking up on us - Laura will turn 5 this summer, and so the school questions start coming up. We&rsquo;ve pretty well decided to homeschool her for the time being, and communicated that intent to our local elementary school last month. Now I&rsquo;ve gotta get the ins and outs of the homeschool support/oversight system understood in preparation for next fall. Oh, and sign up with HSLDA.</li>
<li>When I have trouble coming up with something for the fifth bullet, you know that either things have been fairly uneventful or I&rsquo;m just having a horrible time remembering anything. *sigh*</li>

I&rsquo;ve enjoyed Poyer&rsquo;s other Dan Lenson novels but this one was really just okay. A middling, disjointed story at best. As big a fan as I was of Tom Clancy back in the 90&rsquo;s, I should be the last to criticize authors for hanging on and writing a long series around a single character, but Poyer appears to be the next in a long line of authors that have burned out their series that way (see also: Tom Clancy, Dale Brown).</p>
<p>So, yeah, I read it, and was mildly entertained&hellip; but only mildly. It&rsquo;s time for these authors to start writing some creative plots instead of just stringing us along for yet another novel featuring the same guy in similar situations. Bleh.</p>

			 <p>Last night after Wednesday night church, as we were just about to settle down for the night, Becky called out to me from downstairs. It wasn&rsquo;t her usual voice, asking me for something - this was her oh-no-this-is-trouble voice. &ldquo;Chris I need you downstairs.&rdquo; When I got downstairs, I got part two of the announcement. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got water all over the floor.&rdquo; Now, the words &ldquo;water on the floor&rdquo; bring back instant connotations of the flood last summer. Fortunately, though, what we found wasn&rsquo;t anything near so troubling. Which is not to say that we were very happy about it, since there were puddles of warm water all around the floor near the water heater.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/900879537c.jpg" alt="water heater">I pulled out a flashlight and confirmed my suspicions: the water heater had developed a leak and was dripping the last of its contents out onto the floor. I turned off the water and gas feeds to the heater and Becky got out the towels. (One nice side-benefit of the flood: we now have a large supply of towels that are good for nothing but wiping up the floor.) We wiped up the remaining mess and then, rather than settling down to watch a little bit of TV, pulled out the computer to do some online water heater research. My posts to Twitter and Facebook evoked sympathy, advice, and at least one offer to help with an install. But having neither the time nor really the know-how to do the install, I decided to head for Lowe&rsquo;s this morning, based on their proximity to our place and a good recommendation from a friend.</p>
<p>I had a one-hour window this morning to leave work, purchase the water heater and arrange for install, and get back to work before my meeting started. It was a quick trip to Lowe&rsquo;s, and I found that at 8:00 in the morning there are plenty of employees there and ready to help. I selected my heater of choice, ponied up for installation and the city permit, and headed back to work. The woman at Lowe&rsquo;s figured there was no way we&rsquo;d get it installed today, hopefully tomorrow, otherwise it&rsquo;d be Monday. I offered a quick prayer for an installer with some free time and headed back to work. Thirty minutes later I got the phone call back from the installer. Would I be available today at 11:00? So providential timing number one: we were able to get the heater installed the same morning.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice water heater, too - high efficiency, 50-gallon, eligible for a rebate from the gas company, 12-year warranty, etc. And, so far as I can tell, it heats water nicely. (My shower tonight was quite pleasant.) Oh, so on to providential timing number two: our income tax refund got deposited to our bank account yesterday. It&rsquo;s not how we&rsquo;d planned to use the money, but it is sure a blessing to have it there for the need.</p>
<p>Thus concludes this chapter of the Mundane Adventures of Chris in Iowa. Tune in this weekend to find out about Chris&rsquo;s first time on the Stonebridge worship team. Good night.</p>

			 <p>Normally when we think about musicians and &ldquo;their music&rdquo;, we think about the music that they write, perform, and record. But author Ben Ratliff (jazz critic for the <em>New York Times</em>) decided to ask a different question. What do these musicians listen to and find influential? What are they thinking and hearing as they listen to the music? So Ratliff met with a dozen or so noted jazz musicians, asked them what tracks they&rsquo;d like to listen to, and then relates to us the experience and conversations of listening to the music with the musicians. The result is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Ear-Conversations-over-Music/dp/0805081461%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0805081461">The Jazz Ear: Conversations Over Music</a></em>. It turns out to be fascinating stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Ear-Conversations-over-Music/dp/0805081461%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0805081461"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/0ed5c8e551.jpg" alt=""></a>Though I am a musician and fancy myself a fan (though not a hardcore <em>aficionado</em>) of jazz, it quickly became clear to me that the plane these guys think on is just incredibly high. It <em>is</em> fascinating in its own way, though, listening to serious jazz players talk about how they think about jazz. My favorite part of the book, though, was the reference list at the back, where Ratliff lists each recording that he listened to with each of the musicians. It has been a great input for my personal playlist&hellip; so much to explore.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a musician, like jazz, or just want to explore the minds of some great musicians, I&rsquo;d recommend picking up <em>The Jazz Ear</em>. It&rsquo;s a short read, but quite worth it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s <em>Ender</em> series since I read it a few years ago. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Special-Anniversary-Exculsive-Author-Recordings/dp/B001R1FXA8%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB001R1FXA8">Ender&rsquo;s Game</a></em> is just brilliant storytelling, and <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> is equally good, perhaps even better themes and story woven through it. So when I saw <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ender-Exile-Orson-Scott-Card/dp/0765304961%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0765304961">Ender In Exile</a></em> on the library shelf, it was a no-brainer to pick it up.</p>

Once he had defeated humanity&rsquo;s mortal enemies and then had his reputation dragged through the mud in court martial, he then travels off to become the governor of a colony on another planet. A good bit of the story is told in the form of emails exchanged between Ender, his parents, his siblings Valentine and Peter, and Ender&rsquo;s former military commander. Ender manipulates situations with seeming effortlessness, always nobly wanting the good and right thing.</p>
<p><em>EIE</em> will be interesting to you if you&rsquo;ve read and enjoyed the other books in the <em>Ender</em> series. If not, I&rsquo;d probably stay away from it, and would recommend <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> instead as a good introduction to Card&rsquo;s work. I think it&rsquo;s time that OSC come up with a new story and series.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday afternoon we went over to a friend&rsquo;s house for her belated 30th birthday party. It was a good time - the carrot cake was tasty; there were friends there we hadn&rsquo;t seen in quite a while; all in all, just about what a birthday open house ought to be. It seemed, though, that I couldn&rsquo;t go more than about two minutes without hearing Facebook pop up in a conversation.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, this wasn&rsquo;t a party entirely populated with geeks. Sure, I was there, but I&rsquo;m the exception rather than the rule. But let&rsquo;s review. The invite I got for the party: via Facebook. Several comments from the party with the flavor of &ldquo;yeah, I saw that on your Facebook&rdquo;. Comment to the parents with the new baby: &ldquo;oh, I haven&rsquo;t seen him yet&hellip; except on Facebook&rdquo;. And it wasn&rsquo;t just the thirty-somethings; the fifty-something retired friend is quite active there, too. (She&rsquo;s probably challenging my wife to another game of WordTwist right this very minute.)</p>
<p>Got home from the party, popped out my iPod Touch to check my email. (Couldn&rsquo;t do it <em>at</em> the party, since our friends have secured their wifi and I didn&rsquo;t take the time to ask for the password.) Saw that the host of our church small group had added me as a Facebook friend. I kick over to the FB app and confirm him as a friend. Long story short, he needed to call to ask about us hosting small group. He didn&rsquo;t have my phone number. So, he looked me up on FB, wrote on the Wall to get my attention, then asked my phone number via chat. (He could&rsquo;ve shortened that a bit if he&rsquo;d just looked at my Info tab, which has my cell # on it&hellip; but oh well.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to think there might be something to this Facebook thing.</p>

			 <p>Every culture has its quirks, but to really notice them and appreciate them you need to be able to look from the perspective of an outsider. When you can then write about those quirks with wit, humor, and insight, then you&rsquo;re approaching what author Sarah Lyall has achieved with <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anglo-Files-Field-Guide-British/dp/0393058468%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393058468">The Anglo Files</a></em>. Lyall, a correspondent for the <em>New York Times</em>, was posted to Britain some ten years ago, married a Britisher, and now raises two children there in London whilst still writing for the <em>Times</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anglo-Files-Field-Guide-British/dp/0393058468%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0393058468"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-G6cH4JAL._SL160_.jpg" alt=""></a>In <em>The Anglo Files</em> we get Lyall&rsquo;s thoughts on the oddities of British culture - there are chapters on drinking, hedgehogs, social classes and the nobility, cricket, and the propensity to apologize for everything. She&rsquo;s not afraid to tell stories on herself, either. And those stories prove insightful; they&rsquo;re not the clueless-American-rube-bumbles-around-Europe stories, they&rsquo;re the urbane-American-married-to-a-Britisher-still-baffled-by-Europe stories, which are really more fun. I myself have never been to Britain, but have long been intrigued with our brethren across the pond, so I very much enjoyed Lyall&rsquo;s insights into them.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention the humor? I was good-naturedly amused throughout the book, but one line in particular had me laughing out loud: she describes an inferior washing machine as having a spin cycle that took so long it should&rsquo;ve been called a Ring Cycle. That&rsquo;s worth at least a couple of chuckles, folks.</p>
<p>All in all, a fun book. Definitely worth the read.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I should say this up front: the idea that I&rsquo;m going to be able to intelligently &ldquo;review&rdquo; Wright&rsquo;s massive <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Victory-Christian-Origins-Question/dp/0800626826%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0800626826">Jesus and the Victory of God</a></em> in a 250-word blog post is ridiculous at best, and insane at worst. But I&rsquo;m posting individual reviews for each book I finish this year, so here goes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Victory-Christian-Origins-Question/dp/0800626826%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0800626826"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71Q0YSW67JL._SL160_.gif" alt=""></a>I first became familiar with N. T. Wright through some of his shorter books: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Saint-Paul-Really-Said/dp/0802844456%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0802844456">What Saint Paul Really Said</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simply-Christian-Christianity-Makes-Sense/dp/0060507152%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0060507152">Simply Christian</a></em>, and, of course, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Surprised-Hope-Rethinking-Resurrection-Mission/dp/0061551821%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0061551821">Surprised by Hope</a></em>. Somewhere along the way I found out that he has written a three-volume set specifically about Jesus, and so I requested one of the volumes for Christmas back a year ago. (Why I requested Volume Two of a three volume set is beyond me&hellip; but I did.)</p>
<p>Sure, there have been a million books written about Jesus. So why does Wright&rsquo;s stand out? Wright takes the angle of exploring what I&rsquo;ll call the &ldquo;historical&rdquo; Jesus. What was Jesus, the man, thinking? What were his goals? How did the things he said fit into the theological and political scene of first-century Palestine? Wright answers these questions brilliantly, with clarity and insight.</p>
<p>As just a small example, Wright at one point asks this question: Did Jesus <em>know</em> that he was the Son of God? Certainly we affirm that Jesus was fully man and fully God, but how did Jesus the man <em>know</em> that he was God? Wright gives by way of answer this analogy: Jesus knew he was the Son of God in the same way a musician knows they are a musician. They have the skills and abilities of a musician, and something deep within them says &lsquo;I simply must make this music&rsquo;. As such, a person <em>knows</em> they are a musician. Similarly, Jesus knew he had the skills and abilities of the Messiah, and had the internal calling. It may not be a perfect analogy, but it certainly provides opportunity to stop and think.</p>
<p><em>Jesus and the Victory of God</em> deals with Jesus' life and teaching, leading right up to his death. Wright then devotes the entire third volume in his series to the Resurrection. (I got that book for Christmas <em>this</em> year.) <em>Jesus and the Victory of God</em> isn&rsquo;t a simple read - it&rsquo;s more like a college-level scholarly text. But if you&rsquo;re willing to make the effort to dig through it, it will reward you with insight into the life and purposes of Jesus.</p>
<p>Definitely recommended. [You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Victory-Christian-Origins-Question/dp/0800626826%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0800626826">buy <em>Jesus and the Victory of God</em> from amazon.com</a>.]</p>

			 <p>I picked up <em>The Philosopher&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> on a whim from the library. And what a whim. The flyleaf gave a thumbnail description of a philosophy doctoral student who takes a job becoming the tutor for a teenage girl who was in an accident and lost her sense of morality. OK, sounds interesting as far as that goes. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning of the story.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O9CHES?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001O9CHES"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/06c5bc2697.jpg" alt=""></a><em>The Philosopher&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> is really a story in three acts. Act One: doctoral student tutors teenager on remote Caribbean island. Finds out there is more to the island than he was led to believe, including two sisters of his student, a bunch of genetic engineering, and talking iguana. I know it sounds like a tripped-out dream, but it&rsquo;s just hard to give a lot more detail without spoiling major points of the plot.</p>
<p>Act Two: philosophy tutor watches from a distance as his former student, suddenly fabulously wealthy, takes his teachings on morality to unbelievable ends.</p>
<p>Act Three: tutor and student end up together again and have to deal with the fallout from the rest of the world as it reacts to the student&rsquo;s programs.</p>
<p><em>The Philosopher&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> is at times quite humorous, at times quite serious, and dances along the line between fiction and fantasy without quite ever deciding where to land. It was a fun read, provoking some interesting thoughts along the way. Worth picking up if you get the chance.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been neglecting this blog for the past few weeks, so it&rsquo;s time for an update of sorts. So&hellip; bullet points!</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re in the home stretch of the pregnancy&hellip; just a little more than two months until baby #3 is scheduled to make his/her appearance. The girls have finally decided that they&rsquo;d like a little brother - they want to have a prince to play with them when they&rsquo;re playing princesses.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve decided on sticking at Stonebridge for the forseeable future, and we&rsquo;re starting to plug in. First up: small groups. The group we&rsquo;re joining starts up next Monday night. It&rsquo;ll be good to just sit down and get to know some folks.</li>
<li>In the vein of church stuff, I&rsquo;ve contacted the music pastor at Stonebridge and arranged a time to get together and talk about how I might occasionally serve on the worship team. The key word here is <em>occasional</em>. I don&rsquo;t want to be in a position where I&rsquo;m indispensable. I think it can be worked out.</li>
<li>On the work front, the project I&rsquo;d been working on for the past 18 months got shut down last week. All of us working it are getting transferred to new projects and new groups. I&rsquo;m going to be joining a group that focuses on aircraft certification. It&rsquo;ll mean a lot less coding and a lot more documenting, but it&rsquo;ll be very good experience and learning for my DER ticket.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s still winter in Iowa, but it&rsquo;s been at least tolerable the past week. It got up above freezing yesterday, and we haven&rsquo;t had any significant snowfall this week. I can handle winter when it&rsquo;s like this.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to a weekend with very little on the schedule. Nothing scheduled for Saturday, just church on Sunday. Time to crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, enough for now.</p>

			 <p>After Nick chided me last night about my infrequent blogging, and after <a href="http://www.qwertyuppy.com">Roger</a> <a href="http://www.rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/2009/01/19/observations-on-worship-teams/comment-page-1/#comment-20983">noted elsewhere</a> that he&rsquo;d never really heard any conclusions from our church search, it occurred to me that I&rsquo;d never really written a concluding chapter to <a href="/tag/church-search/">that story</a>. Let me fix that now.</p>
<p>We knew when we made our list of churches to visit that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a long list. We started with three churches that were our primary focus, and after <a href="/08/10/an-end-times-deal-breaker/">ruling out one of them</a> midway through, it was really down to two: <a href="http://www.maranathabible.org">Maranatha Bible</a> and <a href="http://www.insidestonebridge.com">Stonebridge</a>. We visited both of those churches multiple times, evaluating and praying that God would direct us. Looking for churches is frustrating from a time perspective, too - there are only so many church services per week that you can visit. Patience is required. Not easy.</p>
<p>In the end, while we liked both churches and could&rsquo;ve probably been happy at either, we decided back in mid-November that we would give it a go at Stonebridge. There&rsquo;s a lot of good going on there, the teaching has been solid, there are lots of ministry opportunities. We&rsquo;ve signed up to join a small group that will start meeting next week. I&rsquo;m excited to get the chance to start to get to know some people and really feel like I&rsquo;m a part of the place. We&rsquo;ll see how God continues to lead, but for now, we&rsquo;re happy to start calling Stonebridge home. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s a while before we have to do the church search again.</p>

			 <p>Andy Osenga <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com/2009/01/19/the-reason/">nailed it on his blog today</a> by answering the question &ldquo;how do know when I&rsquo;m ready to &lt; insert thing here &gt;?&rdquo;. In his particular case the question revolved around when to record a CD, but he applies the lesson to all of life, and he&rsquo;s right on. The money quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So my answer to the question “how do I know I’m ready to make an album?” is probably the same as the answer to many other questions like it. Because you feel the need and it’s become possible for you. And because otherwise you won’t be ready yet, won’t be ready yet, won’t be ready yet and then one day it will be too late.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It’s like getting married, having a kid, driving a car. You’re never ready. You just decide to do what you feel you need to do, from my perspective this is called “obedience”, and you do it as well as you can and you wait for something supernatural to bless it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve watched with interest the transformation of an internet acquaintance&rsquo;s blog over the past several months. In past years his blog has been, in many ways, similar to mine - intermittent family updates, pictures of the kids, occasional rants on music or politics, etc. I subscribed to the blog and enjoyed the occasional updates.</p>
<p>Then several months ago this acquaintance started a topical blog in earnest, then remade his personal blog as the beginning of an organized effort to try to help along the book he is writing. As I&rsquo;ve followed the blog feed, I&rsquo;ve seen him follow all the pro-blogger tips - posting at consistent, regular, intervals; asking questions to engage the audience; coming up with catchy titles for the posts; posting lots of multimedia; the list goes on and on. And here&rsquo;s the thing: while I wish him all the best with his blog and book efforts, I find myself not interested in his blog any more. It&rsquo;s no longer really about him so much as it is about <em>his brand</em>.</p>
<p>As I was thinking through this, I asked myself a question that&rsquo;s a good question for all bloggers who are hoping to attract readers: &ldquo;Fill in the blank: I would recommend this blog to people who are interested in _____&rdquo;. The answer to that question gives you two things: (1) an idea of who to market your blog to, and (2) the type of content you should be writing to keep them coming back.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let my book-writing friend work through those questions himself; I just want to turn the question back on myself. To whom would I recommend this blog? And the best answer I can come up with is: people who are interested in me, or in many of the same things I&rsquo;m interested in.</p>
<p>Until the day I become a massive celebrity, this will naturally keep my readership small (though it&rsquo;s probably still larger than the quality of the content deserves!). And I&rsquo;m OK with that - in fact, it&rsquo;s sort of a relief. When I keep my expectations low, I don&rsquo;t feel the pressure to serve the blog - the blog can serve me. And that&rsquo;s how it should be.</p>

Glazer was inspired by a movie &ldquo;sting&rdquo; - a scene where a team of shady characters pretend to be police in order to steal from criminals - and, with the help of a few friends, became a master sting artist himself.</p>

			 <p>I was browsing the sci-fi section in the local library and came across an old paperback with a familiar name on the spine: Stephen Baxter. I&rsquo;m most familiar with Baxter&rsquo;s collaboration with the late Arthur C. Clarke on the <em>Manifold</em> trilogy, but have enjoyed a few of his solo works as well. This one looked to be a bit older (there was a quote on the cover from Clarke hailing Baxter as &ldquo;a major new talent&rdquo;), but I figured it was worth a try.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ring-Stephen-Baxter/dp/0061056944%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0061056944"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511G8QSZH2L._SL160_.jpg" alt=""></a><em>Ring</em> finds humanity in the Third Millennium traveling through space, having learned some fantastic tricks of physics (including controlling wormholes that access the future) from alien races. Having also achieved &ldquo;anti-senesence&rdquo; technology (i.e. they can stop aging), a group of explorers decide to undertake a million-year trip at relativistic speeds, keeping a wormhole open the whole way so that they can communicate from the future back to the past.</p>
<p>What unfolds is a fascinating story of space and time, on a scale of megayears. Baxter is at his best when he&rsquo;s dealing with the hard science, describing the aging process of stars, but he holds his own, too, with the softer side - imagining what a hyperspace trip across the universe might feel like from the perspective of the solitary human piloting the ship, recognizing that even millions of years of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; won&rsquo;t change human nature.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re into hard sci-fi, <em>Ring</em> is worth picking up, a very enjoyable read.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2009/01/05/a-year-of.html">2008: A Year of Reading in Review</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2009/01/05/a-year-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-01-05 19:27:22 -0500">Jan 5, 2009</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This the only year-end post I&rsquo;ll write; just a summary of <a href="/books-i-read-in-2008/">my book reading list from 2008</a>.</p>
<p>Some quick details:</p>
<p><strong>Total Books Read:</strong> 78. This is down a bit from 86 last year.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction:</strong> 57. <strong>Non-fiction:</strong> 21.</p>
<p>That ratio is still weighted a little heavily toward fiction, I think, but when I know how shallow and quick some of those novels were and how long and think some of the non-fiction was&hellip; well, it evens out.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite novel of the year:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Birth-Jeffrey-Archer/dp/0312379293%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0312379293"><em>A Prisoner of Birth</em></a> by Jeffery Archer. This was far and away the best, most enjoyable story I read all year. It&rsquo;s essentially a modern-day retelling of Alexandre Dumas' <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>. What sold me on it, though, was that there were characters you could really root for. Good guys that were really good. Honorable supporting characters who remained honorable. Such a good story. I should put it on reserve at the library again.</p>
<p>Runner up: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Wife-Audrey-Niffenegger/dp/015602943X%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D015602943X"><em>The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife</em></a> by Audrey Niffenegger.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite non-fiction of the year:</strong> This is tough because non-fiction spans such a range of subjects. Some high points, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Van-Allen-First-Billion/dp/0877459991%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0877459991"><em>James Van Allen: The First Eight Billion Miles</em></a> by Abigail Foerstner. A biography of the Iowan who played a huge role in space exploration.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Newjack-Guarding-Sing-Ted-Conover/dp/0375726624%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0375726624"><em>Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing</em></a> by Ted Conover. An inside look at the correctional officers who run Sing Sing prison.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCase-Amillennialism-Understanding-End-Times%2Fdp%2F080106435X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1215282338%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">A Case for Amillennialism</a></em> by Kim Riddlebarger. Quite helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Worst book of the year:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Jesus-Vote-Perspective/dp/1400074061%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1400074061"><em>How Would Jesus Vote?</em></a> by the late D. James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe. I thought <a href="/08/10/book-review-how-would-jesus-vote-by-d-james-kennedy/">my blog review</a> of it was bad until I read <a href="http://www.moreron.com/2008/10/31/book-review-how-would-jesus-vote/">Ron&rsquo;s review</a>. He said, in short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The book is awful. Simply awful. I can’t stress to you how amazingly awful this book is. Do not buy, read, or borrow this book. I will likely use my copy for kindling in the fireplace this winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love Ron.</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s enough book wrap-up for this year. I&rsquo;m contemplating a change in format for book reviews next year, doing a full post on each book and cross-posting them to Amazon to build a little bit of reviewing credibility there. Dunno, it&rsquo;s just a thought. [No, Geof, I&rsquo;m not doing it entirely because you changed the format of GNM.]</p>
<p>Next year&rsquo;s list will still exist in some format. First book on it will be an old one by Stephen Baxter. Almost finished it for 2008, but not quite.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve taken plenty of pictures the past few days, but the dial-up internet connection here at the folks' house isn&rsquo;t up to uploading them, so they&rsquo;ll wait until we get home on Sunday. (To be quite fair, my folks aren&rsquo;t Luddites in the least when it comes to the internet; they simply live so far out that their only options are dial-up or ridiculously-expensive satellite. But I digress.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such fun to have the whole family together again for a weekend - Andrew and Heather are in from Washington; Ryan is here from Chicago; we&rsquo;ve come up from Iowa and the rest are, for the moment, locals of Richland Center, WI. I have a feeling these full-family gatherings will be fewer and farther between as the years go on, so we need to enjoy these when we have the chance.</p>
<p>New Years' Eve we celebrated Christmas as a family, exchanging gifts and eating rather too much. I was blessed with a case for my iPod and a copy of N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>The Resurrection of the Son of God</em>, a lengthy volume that will likely keep me busy for a long while this upcoming year. (Thanks, Ryan!) New Years' Day was rather uneventful; much decorating was done at the church, and it was concluded by my brother Aaron&rsquo;s bachelor party - a party much unlike what typically comes to mind when you say &ldquo;bachelor party&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s just say it was attended by nearly 20 men who carried Bibles and weren&rsquo;t afraid to use them. :-) It was a good, encouraging time, enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, the preparations continued in earnest for Aaron and Emily&rsquo;s wedding. Final decorations were hung; we walked through the rehearsal; finally, we ate a LOT of tasty catered Mexican food for the rehearsal dinner, and celebrated Aaron&rsquo;s birthday. Oh, and Rebecca made the cakes, and whipped up a LOT of frosting. (Pictures to follow.)</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Saturday morning and we&rsquo;re praying that the freezing rain forecast for late this afternoon holds off for a few extra hours so everyone can make it to the wedding. The big event is at 4:30 this afternoon, with dinner and dancing to follow. Big congratulations go out to Aaron and Emily on this landmark day in their lives. Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me&hellip; I think I have a shirt to go iron.</p>

			 <p>Nothing like a holiday and a week off work to slow down the blog posting.</p>
<p>We started our Christmas celebration on Christmas Eve, attending the service at Stonebridge. While it was a bit longer service than I expected, it was quite good, and the girls managed to sit through it (a whole hour!) without making too much ruckus. Then we made a quick trip down to the Fedex office to pick up the new laptop that had made it as far as the distribution office but not actually delivered.</p>
<p>Christmas morning we opened presents. Highlights for the girls: Addie got a little tent and sleeping bag; Laura got a scooter and a &ldquo;spotting scope&rdquo;. (It looks like a pirate spyglass to me, but Diego calls his a &ldquo;spotting scope&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s all that matters to Laura. :-)) The girls also ended up with a multitude of puzzles and DVDs. I got some good stuff, too: some gift cards to my favorite local fast-food places (guilt-free eat outs!), a new fountain pen (OK, I&rsquo;ve had it for a few weeks, but it&rsquo;s a Christmas present none the less), and a couple of CDs. I got Becky a new jewelry box and a Baby Blues book; she appears to be enjoying both of them.</p>

<p>On Wednesday we&rsquo;re headed up to Wisconsin to see my family; Andrew and Heather are in from Washington; Ryan is in from the <em>other</em> Washington (DC), and Aaron and Emily are getting married on Saturday! Exciting times for the Hubbs family. Then next week &ldquo;real life&rdquo; starts again and I have to go back to work. I <em>am</em> thankful, though, for this Christmas break. A week and a half off of work is such a lovely thing this time of year. Happy New Year to you all!</p>

			 <p>Songwriting, you ask? Yeah, if <a href="/08/12/a-fun-evening-a-late-night-and-musical-kinship/">you missed it</a>, I was invited to attend the Iowa Songwriter&rsquo;s Guild meeting last month and they planted the bug again. So I&rsquo;ve been keeping the songwriting idea in mind, looking for and writing down ideas, phrases, and so on. I have at least one idea that I really like as a concept; now I have to find a way to put actual words to it.</p>
<p>As a worship leader and accompanist for many years, one of my greatest gifts has been that I have an immense capacity for remembering music and lyrics and then playing them back. I could sit down with nothing more than a list of song titles and play and sing you songs for hours and hours. That skill, though, seems to become a curse when it comes to songwriting. Because I have trained my brain for so many years to remember and replay other people&rsquo;s melodies and lyrics, now when I try to create my own phrase, I write down two words and it makes some other song lyric pop into my head. Play a couple of chords and it pops a song into my head. And once it&rsquo;s in my head, it&rsquo;s hard to banish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to keep at it, though, and hope to attend January&rsquo;s Guild meeting with at least <em>something</em> to show for my efforts. I may not ever turn out a great song, but it&rsquo;s at least worth the effort to try.</p>

			 <p>In the 11 or 12 Christmases Becky and I have spent together, each has been celebrated with one set of parents or the other; most of them with my family, which has always lived closer, but a few Christmases we&rsquo;ve made the drive to North Carolina to celebrate with Becky&rsquo;s family. This year, though, a convergence of plans and events has set things up so that we will be spending Christmas day at home, just us and the girls. We&rsquo;ll get to see my family the following week (for a wedding, no less!) but this week it&rsquo;ll just be us.</p>
<p>Becky and I now get to start to decide what our family Christmases will look like. There&rsquo;s a huge amount of latitude, given that there are no expectations from anyone. If we want to make changes, now is the time. If you think about it too long, it becomes a little bit overwhelming. Becky touched on it yesterday when we were discussing our Christmas dinner menu. She said she didn&rsquo;t plan on making all the usual side dishes to go with the ham, but when I noted this was her chance to start a new tradition, she said she didn&rsquo;t really know where to start.</p>
<p>It seems to me that part of the reason traditions don&rsquo;t change <em>too</em> greatly from generation to generation isn&rsquo;t just the fond memories we have of years gone by, or the actual love of specific foods or songs; it is also the added comfort and ease of just keeping things the same - in other words: change is hard. Now, that&rsquo;s not a very heartwarming thought for a pre-Christmas afternoon, but it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve got for today.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don&rsquo;t forsee any huge changes for the Hubbs family this Christmas. We might go wild and fix a few different side-dishes to go with the ham. But we&rsquo;re still having ham. Some things are just too sacred to mess around with.</p>

			 <p>Our little Addison (age two and a half) caught a low-grade stomach bug earlier this week. She wasn&rsquo;t notably ill or uncomfortable, just sleeping more than usual and not wanting to eat much of anything. That it was, in fact, a stomach bug became clear on Wednesday morning when she threw up. Still, she was running around like normal, and talked more and faster than an overcaffeinated chipmunk for the first ten minutes after I got home from work.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, with church activities canceled due to other folks being sick, we decided to go drive through Culver&rsquo;s and bring some burgers home. (Oh, and some cheese curds&hellip; yum yum.) Addie wanted to eat, so we went ahead and gave her a quarter of a cheeseburger and a few fries. And I tell you: that girl went to town.</p>
<p>She ate the first few fries in no time flat. She asked for more. What the heck, we said. If she&rsquo;s hungry and wants to eat, she can have all the fries she wants. So she ate a couple more fries, then started in on the burger. She had eaten probably half the burger, and had the rest of it half-chewed when I saw her make a gagging face. I warned Becky and she grabbed Addie&rsquo;s plate (by now empty except for a few fries) and up came the burger. After a couple more heaves she was done, and her determination was remarkable. Without even sparing a second, two words came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More ketchup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See, it didn&rsquo;t matter that she&rsquo;d just thrown up her entire dinner back on to her plate. What mattered was that there were three unscathed french fries left on that plate, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough ketchup left for those fries. That, my friends, is focus.</p>
<p>While she didn&rsquo;t get the rest of those fries, she did start managing to keep food down Wednesday night, and by Thursday afternoon she was eating another cheeseburger, and more french fries, and feeling fine.</p>
<p>[Disclaimer so I don&rsquo;t feel like a bad parent: yes, we regularly feed our kids stuff healthier than cheeseburgers. The end.]</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll work through that title backwards. How do you know when you have some musical kinship with someone else? How about when they pull out that obscure song that they really like and want you to hear&hellip; and it&rsquo;s a song you&rsquo;ve been playing on repeat on your iPod for weeks?</p>
<p>That very thing happened last night at Nick and Allie&rsquo;s house. After the <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=240006314">Iowa Songwriter&rsquo;s Guild</a> house show I hung out for a while to hear some of Allie&rsquo;s new hymntunes and to generally talk music with Nick, and he pulled out The Khrusty Brothers' <em>Sympathy for Jesus</em>. What a great song. That provoked a discussion on Don Chaffer and Waterdeep, and ended up with Nick lending me all of his Waterdeep CDs so I can take a listen. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening Nick &amp; Allie hosted the Iowa Songwriters' Guild monthly meeting, which this month was a special house show. Each of the writers played a couple of songs, and I quite enjoyed hearing folks share their talent. I was motivated to try to dust off my long-neglected songwriting chops; what remains to be seen is if that motivation will last long enough to actually write anything. Nick did send a book on songwriting home with me, though, so I&rsquo;ll have to take a look at it. We&rsquo;ll just have to see how it goes.</p>

			 <p>When Andy Osenga&rsquo;s <em>The Morning</em> came out two and a half years ago (to <a href="/06/04/andrew-osenga-the-morning/">much</a> <a href="/06/05/sweet-musicy-goodness/">fanfare</a> on this blog) I would not have predicted that <em><a href="http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/new-beginning/">New Beginning</a></em> would become the signature track off the record. <em>Early In The Morning</em> would&rsquo;ve been my bet, with then either <em><a href="http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/house-of-mirrors/">House of Mirrors</a></em> or <em><a href="http://andrewosenga.net/song-vault/marilyn/">Marilyn</a></em> next on my list.</p>
<p>Thirty months later, though, <em>New Beginning</em> has become the most durable track, evidenced by, if nothing else, the fact that Andy is performing it <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/07/late-nighter/">almost</a> <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/04/sadies-birthday/">every</a> <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com/2008/12/03/starting-the-tour/">night</a> this year on the Behold the Lamb Christmas tour.</p>
<p>The bridge of the song still gets me every time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can feel a prayer rising And I don’t even know the words Still the groaning is the postage And it will not be returned Though we’re living in this rubble Of our reckless plans and games We are reaching for the promise That we will not stay the same&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks, Andy, for a great song.</p>

			 <p>Yes, we have a weekend coming up. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ll be heading into the weekend with a house full of sickies - Becky, both girls, and I are all fighting colds, coughs, and sore throats. Ick. So, here&rsquo;s my list of guesses of things we&rsquo;ll do this weekend.</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ll want to sleep in tomorrow morning, but won&rsquo;t really get to, since the girls pretty much are up at 7:00 regardless of what day it is.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll rent another DVD or two from the store and catch up on a bit of our movie watching. Maybe Wall-E or Hancock.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll hit CiCi&rsquo;s for cheap-o pizza.</li>
<li>We won&rsquo;t get to church, given that we&rsquo;re all feeling icky.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll visit the library sometime&hellip; probably Saturday.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll watch some college football&hellip; most definitely the Florida/Alabama game.</li>
<li>I won&rsquo;t post anything more interesting than this to the blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s my profound list for Friday. I&rsquo;ll check back in on Monday to see what kind of score I get.</p>

			 <p>OK, so can we just agree that the BCS really stinks, and there must be a better way to do college football playoffs? Every year there&rsquo;s whining because some team deserves a shot and doesn&rsquo;t get it, and some other team may not be as deserving, but the computers seem to like them&hellip; it&rsquo;s just never good. So here&rsquo;s my proposal for moving Division 1-A NCAA football to a playoff system.</p>
<p><strong>1. Expand the Big 10 and Pac 10 to 12 teams each.</strong> There&rsquo;s already a weird schedule imbalance between the Big and Pac 10&rsquo;s and the SEC and Big 12. Namely: the conference playoff. The SEC and Big 12 are having big games this coming weekend, but the Big 10 has already been done with its season for two weeks now. It just ain&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>So get Notre Dame to join the Big 10, which would make twelve teams (Penn State joined as the 11th team almost 20 years ago). Get Utah and Boise State to join the Pac 10, giving it 12 teams. That allows each of the big 4 conferences to form two divisions and hold a conference championship game.</p>
<p><strong>2. Split them into divisions this way:</strong></p>
<p>Big 10 Midwest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illinois</li>
<li>Notre Dame</li>
<li>Iowa</li>
<li>Wisconsin</li>
<li>Purdue</li>
<li>Minnesota</li>
</ul>
<p>Big 10 East:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Michigan State</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Northwestern</li>
<li>Penn State</li>
<li>Indiana</li>
</ul>
<p>Pac 10 North:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Oregon State</li>
<li>Washington State</li>
<li>Washington</li>
<li>Boise State</li>
<li>Utah</li>
</ul>
<p>Pac 10 South:</p>
<ul>
<li>USC</li>
<li>California</li>
<li>Arizona</li>
<li>Arizona State</li>
<li>Stanford</li>
<li>UCLA</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s another added benefit: Notre Dame, Boise State, and Utah have all fairly regularly been &ldquo;non-BCS&rdquo; teams that got to go to BCS bowls, which always throws a wrench in the works. This would get those teams up playing with the big boys and incorporated into the system.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make an 8-team playoff.</strong></p>
<p>Eight teams means only three rounds. (The conference title games are effectively another round of playoffs in and of themselves, but who&rsquo;s counting?) Three rounds is doable. You can use the four existing BCS bowls as hosts of the first round of the playoffs. It does mean you have to move them so that they all play the same day again, but hey, the bowls were better that way, anyway. Since we already have that silly extra National Title game, that means we&rsquo;d only have to add two games to the schedule to do a full three-round playoff.</p>
<p><strong>4. Give the champions of the big four conferences the top four seeds in the tournament.</strong></p>
<p>Because hey, they deserve them.</p>
<p><strong>5. Let an NCAA committee seed the top four teams and then select and seed four more teams to fill out the tournament.</strong></p>
<p>If they want to keep the BCS rankings and use them as a guide, fine, but let&rsquo;s not have computers picking and seeding teams. The NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball tournament teams and seeds are chosen by a committee, and it&rsquo;s the best tournament out there.</p>
<p><strong>6. Play the title game the week before the Super Bowl.</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s almost always a dead week in between the NFL Conference Finals and the Super Bowl. Seems like the perfect week to play the title game.</p>
<p>So there you go. A simple way to pull in a few more teams, give us a couple more big conference championship games, and settle things once and for all with a real college football championship. What do you think?</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow morning I will get in the car and, rather than heading to work, I will embark on one of my signature crazy-man concert road trips. Previous editions of the road trips have taken me to Chicago and Nashville&hellip; this time I&rsquo;m heading west, to Omaha. The goal this time: the kickoff concert of the 2008 <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em> Christmas tour, featuring <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> and friends.</p>
<p>My current plans are to leave Cedar Rapids first thing in the morning, meet Curt McLey for lunch in Elkhorn (suburban Omaha) around 11:30, and then head over to the church where the concert will take place. It will be good to catch up a bit with the gang of musicians who make up this tour - <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a>, <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Andy Gullahorn</a>, <a href="http://www.jillphillips.com">Jill Phillips</a>, <a href="http://www.benshive.com">Ben Shive</a>&hellip; talented songwriters and musicians, all&hellip; and when you put them all on the same stage&hellip; amazing things happen. The concert is at 7 pm and then it&rsquo;s just 4 short hours on I-80 back home. Good times.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard <em>Behold the Lamb</em> before, you should go buy yourself a copy from the <a href="http://store.rabbitroom.com">Rabbit Room store</a>. Best Christmas album I own, hands down. I&rsquo;ll be bleary-eyed and saddle sore come Wednesday morning, but it will definitely have been worth it. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have some good pictures to post when I get back. Only 18 more hours to wait&hellip;</p>

			 <p>When we visited <a href="http://www.maranathabible.org">Maranatha</a> on Sunday, one of the inserts in their bulletin was a full page giving the testimonies of each of their elder candidates. That got me to wondering what sort of selection and vetting process different churches use for choosing elders.</p>
<p>In my experience at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>, here&rsquo;s what happened: the existing elder board suggested men to serve as elder apprentices. Those apprentices had to be approved by the congregation. Once approved, they met with the elders at all the regular meetings, etc for some period of time - a year, maybe two. At the point the elders were comfortable with their qualifications and thought them ready to become full elders, the elders would recommend the apprentices names to the congregation for approval.</p>
<p>Things that, to me, were notably absent: any sort of in-depth theological examination. Granted, there were some one-on-one theological discussions in various meetings over the apprenticeship period, but there was nothing formal. It was assumed that you agreed to the statement of faith, and that was good enough. While we agreed that Alex Strauch&rsquo;s idea of interviewing elder candidates' wives to get their input was a good idea, in practice I never saw it happen.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question for you, be you a church leader or just a church member: what sort of selection and vetting processes are in place for elder candidates? Popular nomination and election? Any sort of congregational examination? I remember hearing about <a href="http://www.raewhitlock.com">Rae&rsquo;s</a> study sessions before his PCA elder exam, so I know some of the answer I&rsquo;ll get from him, but I&rsquo;m interested in hearing from the rest of you all.</p>

			 <p>There was no post for week 6 last week since we were out of town for the weekend. So now we come to week 7. Yesterday we visited <a href="http://www.maranathabible.org">Maranatha Bible Church</a> for the second time. I gave quite a bit of detail <a href="/08/11/the-church-search-week-5/">when we last visited</a>, I&rsquo;ll just note a few updates here.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Took a slightly different route to get there this week and hit all the lights green&hellip; and it&rsquo;s a quick little trip from our house. 6 or 7 minutes, max.</li>
<li>The place was definitely fuller this week than last time we attended. We parked on the street a few houses down from the church.</li>
<li>Having now visited twice, we look familiar enough to some of the Maranatha folks (especially the ones who we&rsquo;ve faced off against in church softball) that you can tell they recognize us and are <em>this close</em> to saying something to us&hellip; but none did.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music</strong> The regular music leader was back this week. Just looking at her (a short, grandma-aged woman who reminded me a lot of one of my college calculus professors), you wouldn&rsquo;t expect that she is an aggressive, guitar-playing music leader. But she is, and she was excellent. The closing song after the sermon was <em>Victory in Jesus</em>, and while I might&rsquo;ve resisted the very last almost-end-and-then-do-a-slow-drum-fill-into-a-final-final-chorus thing, it was just so much fun I can&rsquo;t really complain a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Ministries</strong> No real updates here. The girls had a good time.</p>
<p><strong>Sermon</strong> Pastor Aaron was trying to crank through two chapters of Isaiah (34 and 35) in the space of 45 minutes, and he did a great job. Very much enjoyed the sermon.</p>
<p><strong>People/Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Had a nice chat after the service with the youth pastor, Thad. He had been reading this blog earlier this week (Hi, Thad!) and said he enjoyed it. He told me he had read my &ldquo;church search&rdquo; posts on the other church we visited, and then went to read the one about Maranatha. And while I might&rsquo;ve expected him to hope that I&rsquo;d give a good review, what he told me was actually not that at all. &ldquo;Please, find some bad stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That way we can take it to people [here at Maranatha] and say, &lsquo;Look, we need to work on this&hellip;'&rdquo;. I thought that was pretty cool. Always thinking about improvement.</li>
<li>Ran into a couple more folks that I knew from other places but was unaware that they attended Maranatha. That was neat.</li>
<li>The service ended a bit early this week because they were holding their annual meeting directly after the service. They planned on electing two elder candidates and one deacon candidate.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, it was an enjoyable Sunday morning. Good to be back in the house of the Lord after being out of town last weekend. Becky and I haven&rsquo;t really discussed the church search any more since yesterday morning, so I&rsquo;m not sure what our plans are going to be for next Sunday or following Sundays. Much prayer and discussion will be involved, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/11/21/what-to-do.html">What to do about &#34;gay marriage&#34;, part 2</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/11/21/what-to-do.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-11-21 09:03:24 -0500">Nov 21, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Becky observed last night that my post yesterday on gay marriage was rather wordy and not as simple as she would&rsquo;ve liked. So, I&rsquo;m taking that as a challenge, and today I&rsquo;m going to try to condense my arguments a bit. Feel free to agree or disagree in the comments.</p>
<p>So, my list of assertions that lead my to my position on gay marriage:</p>
<p><strong>1. While the Bible teaches that homosexual behavior is wrong, the Bible does not teach that the civil government should try to outlaw every sin.</strong></p>
<p>Religious beliefs can disagree with government laws in one of three ways:</p>
<p><strong><em>The law can require behavior that my religion tells me is a sin.</em></strong> For instance, pacifists who are drafted to serve in the military. Typically the US has allowed for conscientious objector status, allowing those people to take non-combat roles. Another example is the allowance in the Constitution to &ldquo;affirm&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;swear&rdquo; oaths of office, for those who believe they should not &ldquo;swear&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong><em>The law can outlaw a behavior that my religion tells me I must do.</em></strong> For instance, the law could instruct me not to share my faith with other people. In this case the Scriptures are quite clear - we must obey God rather than men. (Acts 5:29)</p>
<p><strong><em>The law can allow a behavior that my religion says I must not do.</em></strong> And here the Scriptures are quieter. While certainly we know that God wants our rulers to be just and merciful, we don&rsquo;t see anywhere that God says &ldquo;your rulers should enact all of my laws as laws of the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Tim 2:1-4 says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul says that we pray for our rulers, with the goal or the hope being that we can live peaceful, quiet lives. And note that Paul doesn&rsquo;t say to pray that our rulers would try to enforce God&rsquo;s laws on everyone - Paul says to pray for peaceful, quiet lives, and that from that people might come to a knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><strong>2. If we&rsquo;re not going to use Christian (or Muslim, or Jewish, etc) principles to dictate the details of our laws, instead we should base the laws on socially-agreed-upon principles of freedom, asking &ldquo;what is good for society as a whole?&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Because, really, what other platform are we going to use?</p>
<p><strong>3. Socially-agreed-upon principles change over time.</strong></p>
<p>Just one example out of many: when the USA was founded, the only people allowed to vote were white, land-owning males. This was the socially-accepted norm. Over the past two hundred years, society has come to agree that anyone 18 years of age or older, and who is not mentally incompetent, <em>regardless</em> of gender, race, or land, should be allowed the vote.</p>
<p>Those changes didn&rsquo;t come about because either people said &ldquo;oh my, our voting rules are un-Christian, we need to make them more Christian&rdquo; <em>or</em> because people said &ldquo;oh my, our voting rules are too Christian, we need to make them more secular&rdquo;. By and large, the changes came about because society&rsquo;s views, both Christian and secular, changed.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you&rsquo;re with me this far, then we&rsquo;ve gotten to this question: is &ldquo;gay marriage&rdquo; a reasonable freedom to allow? Something that will be beneficial for, or at least not harmful to, society as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>And this is where the debate really engages. My position is this: yes, gay marriage is a reasonable freedom to allow, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can embrace <a href="/08/11/recognizing-the-civil-religious-disconnect-or-what-to-do-about-gay-marriage/">a civil-religious disconnection.</a></li>
<li>State-sanctioned marriage is essentially a specific path through contract law. When you get married, you automatically get a LOT of legal advantages, things that would be difficult to attain otherwise. What good reason do we have to say that any two people shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to enter into a contract that way?</li>
<li>Society&rsquo;s views <em>have</em> changed, and we may as well acknowledge the change rather than pretend it didn&rsquo;t happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a strictly pragmatic Christian viewpoint, too, we need to pick which battles we want to fight. Yes, we want to see each person come to know Christ and become more like Christ. By fighting this semantic argument over civil &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;, we aren&rsquo;t accomplishing anything other than alienating a large group of people who Christ calls us to love. We certainly aren&rsquo;t helping ourselves gain an audience with them so we can share the Gospel. Real change comes from the inside out, as the heart changes.</p>
<p><strong>5. The government must protect the rights of private groups to discriminate based on their beliefs.</strong></p>
<p>Freedom of association (guaranteed in the First Amendment) implies freedom of disassociation. If a church doesn&rsquo;t want to perform gay marriages, they shouldn&rsquo;t be required to. If the Boy Scouts don&rsquo;t want to allow gays as leaders, they shouldn&rsquo;t be required to. If a religious organization doesn&rsquo;t want to hire gays, they shouldn&rsquo;t be required to.</p>
<p>OK, so I cut it down to 5 points, albeit with a lot of bullets and lists in between. Questions? Comments? Snide remarks? Let it rip in the comments.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the whole &lsquo;gay marriage&rsquo; issue in my head for a while now, driven in good part by <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/index.php/topic,65377.0.html">the discussion over on rmfo.net</a> (you&rsquo;ve gotta be a member to read it, sorry) surrounding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)">California&rsquo;s Proposition 8</a>. The evangelically-popular, Dobsonian position is familiar to me, but has always seemed (like most Dobsonian political positions) to be harmful to the Kingdom; focusing on divisive politics rather than loving everyone and focusing on the heart issues. Today, though, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/11/modernity-faith.html">Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s piece on TheAtlantic.com</a> really solidified things for me; in other words, he said what I&rsquo;ve been thinking - only much more clearly and concisely.</p>
<p>For those of you who may be unfamiliar with Andrew Sullivan, here&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s coming from: he&rsquo;s a relatively conservative gay man. That in itself gives you some idea to which side of the debate he comes down on&hellip; but don&rsquo;t let that bias you towards him without giving him a listen. He nails it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Many long for] a return to the days when civil marriage brought with it a whole bundle of collectively-shared, unchallenged, teleological, and largely Judeo-Christian, attributes. Civil marriage once reflected a great deal of cultural and religious assumptions: that women&rsquo;s role was in the household, deferring to men; that marriage was about procreation, which could not be contracepted; that marriage was always and everywhere for life&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that position, Sullivan says, is untenable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If conservatism is to recover as a force in the modern world, the theocons and Christianists have to understand that their concept of a unified polis [(state)] with a telos [(purpose, goal)] guiding all of us to a theologically-understood social good is a non-starter. Modernity has smashed it into a million little pieces. Women will never return in their consciousness to the child-bearing subservience of the not-so-distant past. Gay people will never again internalize a sense of their own &ldquo;objective disorder&rdquo; to acquiesce to a civil regime where they are willingly second-class citizens. Straight men and women are never again going to avoid divorce to the degree our parents did. Nor are they going to have kids because contraception is illicit. The only way to force all these genies back into the bottle would require&hellip; [an] oppressive police state&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. My dad said much this same thing in a sermon he preached back before the election (which I still haven&rsquo;t posted, sorry, Dad!) when he likened the Dobson-esque conservatives to the proverbial dog chasing a car. The problem for the dog is when it catches the car - what the heck do you do with it then?</p>
<p>Back to Mr. Sullivan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That way is to agree that our civil order will mean less; that it will be a weaker set of more procedural agreements that try to avoid as much as possible deep statements about human nature. And that has a clear import for our current moment. The reason the marriage debate is so intense is because neither side seems able to accept that the word &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; requires a certain looseness of meaning if it is to remain as a universal, civil institution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he nails it with an example that hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not that new. Catholics, for example, accept the word marriage to describe civil marriages that are second marriages, <strong>even though their own faith teaches them that those marriages don&rsquo;t actually exist as such.</strong> But most Catholics are able to set theological beliefs to one side and accept a theological untruth as a civil fact. After all, a core, undebatable Catholic doctrine is that marriage is for life. Divorce is not the end of that marriage in the eyes of God. And yet <strong>Catholics can tolerate fellow citizens who are not Catholic calling their non-marriages marriages - because Catholics have already accepted a civil-religious distinction.</strong> They can wear both hats in the public square.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Emphasis mine.]</p>
<p>I am convinced that this is the right position. Certainly, Christians need to be free to teach per their convictions on homosexuality, and need to be free to discriminate as to who they will marry, hire, and so on. (Sullivan argues specifically for those protections in his column.) But we need to accept, nay, support a broader, freer civil arrangement; an arrangement that allows for freedom for as many as possible to live as their conscience dictates in a way that is consistent with the peaceful, common good.</p>
<p>Putting that civil arrangement in place will provide a basis for the lively exchange of ideas that should be present in a free society. While it won&rsquo;t look quite like what the Founders set up in the United State more than 200 years ago, it&rsquo;ll be more what they intended. Let&rsquo;s face it - we don&rsquo;t live in 1780 anymore. We will do better if we adapt the principles of 1780 for the world of 2008 and move forward. For this topic that means embracing the civil/religious disconnect and supporting state-sanctioned civil marriage for both hetero- and homosexuals.</p>

			 <p>Children have ways of saying things that just cut you to the quick. They don&rsquo;t realize it, but you hear the words, and, <em>whammo</em>, they&rsquo;ve got you. Today&rsquo;s example: my four-year-old daughter Laura.</p>
<p>Laura loves her daddy time, and loves to play. Some days it&rsquo;s Candy Land or Chutes and Ladders; other days it&rsquo;s playing &ldquo;horsies&rdquo; in her room (we each get a toy horse and have pretend conversations!); other times we play hide and seek in the house. (She always hides the same place: under the covers on our bed.) And when she wants me to play with her, she always asks the question the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, do you want to play with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be so much easier if she asked &ldquo;Daddy, will you play with me?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daddy, can you play with me?&rdquo;. Because then at times I could respond &ldquo;sorry, Daddy can&rsquo;t right now&rdquo; and just go back to whatever else I am doing. But instead she asks &ldquo;Daddy, do you want to play with me?&rdquo; and then I&rsquo;m forced to check my motives.</p>
<p>Too often my first (internal) reaction is something along the lines of &ldquo;but I was just checking my email&rdquo; or &ldquo;no, I want to finish reading this article online&rdquo;. And then I&rsquo;m convicted. Shouldn&rsquo;t I really <em>want</em> to play with her?</p>
<p>Time moves fast. Laura is already four. Next year she&rsquo;ll start school of some sort. We won&rsquo;t always have time to play horsies or hide and seek or Candyland. When I stop to think about it, I really do want to spend the time with my girls that I&rsquo;ve been given right now. Facebook, email, and blogs can wait. So I&rsquo;m thankful that God can use even my daughter&rsquo;s simple requests for Daddy time to convict me of my own selfishness. So if this blog sits dormant from time to time, or I don&rsquo;t respond to your email very quickly, be patient: I might just be playing horsies.</p>

			 <p>When we were in Minneapolis last weekend I happened upon one of those dangerous places for me to go in: a pen shop.</p>
<p>Let me back up a bit. I have become quite a fan of fountain pens over the past couple of years. I&rsquo;ve not bought any real expensive pens, but have managed to enjoy and then lose two separate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Al-Star-Fountain-Pen/dp/B0009F1I84">Lamy Safari Al-Stars</a> the past two years - one fell out of my pocket on an airplane, the other dropped off my lanyard undetected last summer. I&rsquo;ve been resisting the urge to buy another one&hellip; but that resistance proved futile on Friday. So, I came out of the store with this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it this morning at work and I had forgotten just how much fun it is to write with a fountain pen.</p>
<p>Officially, Becky declared that this was my Christmas present from her, so I&rsquo;ll say this: thanks, Beck, for the present. It&rsquo;s fantastic. I love it. :-)</p>

			 <p>Discovered this one last night: when I tapped the Genius icon to create a Genius playlist out of the currently-playing song, the playlist it created began with a different version of that song. It was repeatable, happened twice.</p>
<p>In detail: I was playing &ldquo;All the Way Home (live)&rdquo; from Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s <em>Appendix M</em> record. I hit the Genius button to create a playlist, and it generated one quite neatly. Unfortunately, rather than starting the playlist with &ldquo;All the Way Home (live)&rdquo; from <em>Appendix M</em>, it started the playlist with &ldquo;All the Way Home&rdquo; from AP&rsquo;s <em>Carried Along</em>.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know quite what&rsquo;s going on here, but something ain&rsquo;t quite right with the Genius.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a crazy week so I&rsquo;m reduced to one of these play-by-play lists. Sorry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note to self: eating at Texas Roadhouse only two hours before playing a rec league basketball game: not such a good idea.</li>
<li>Looking forward to getting out of town this weekend.</li>
<li>There is pretty much nothing cuter than a four-year-old excited about being invited to a friend&rsquo;s birthday party.</li>
<li>Is Thanksgiving really only two weeks away? Where has the year gone?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m getting a kick out of <a href="http://twitter.com/fakegfmorris/">Fake Geof Morris</a> this morning.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been far too long since I&rsquo;ve listened to Mel Brooks' <em>The Producers</em> soundtrack. Hilariously clever lyrics.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This morning <a href="/08/11/good-friends-say-things-like-this/">we got up off our behinds</a> and visited the next church on our short list: <a href="http://www.maranathabible.org">Maranatha Bible Church</a>. Maranatha has been around for nearly 30 years in Cedar Rapids, sitting on 25th Street near Mount Mercy College. We were familiar with some of the people before we visited; we&rsquo;ve known Pastor Aaron Telecky and his family for several years, Youth Pastor Thad Joyce and his family live just a few blocks up from us here in Hiawatha, and several other faces in the church were familiar from many years of church league softball. It&rsquo;s a bit interesting giving my update on Maranatha this afternoon since I know Aaron reads this blog. Aaron, feel free to comment if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maranatha is in an older church building in the middle of a residential neighborhood. There were several cars parked on the street, but we found a spot in the parking lot.</li>
<li>A couple people greeted us with &ldquo;good morning!&rdquo; as we walked in and found the foyer. An usher handed us bulletins and we hung up our coats. After we had stood there for another ten seconds or so, obviously looking around, the usher asked if we were visiting. When we said yes he introduced himself and welcomed us, but didn&rsquo;t volunteer any info about children&rsquo;s ministries even though we had both girls in tow.</li>
<li>About that time Pastor Aaron walked into the foyer, welcomed us, and introduced us to one of the men who was helping teach one of the girls' classes this morning. That guy (whose name escapes me now) took us downstairs and helped us find the girls classes.</li>
<li>We had just time enough to sign our girls in, get back upstairs, find a seat, and just start looking at the bulletin before the service started.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They had a six-member worship team this morning: piano, two female vocalists, leader w/ acoustic guitar, bass player, and drummer.</li>
<li>Six songs were sung throughout the service; four were relatively new songs, two were old hymns. Four of the six songs were familiar to me; Becky said she was familiar with all of them.</li>
<li>The guy running the overhead had a little trouble keeping up with the music on the first song, which was a fast one. Otherwise, everything ran quite smoothly and the group sounded pretty good. Overall the congregational singing was strong.</li>
<li>We were told afterwards that this wasn&rsquo;t their usual music leader, and that things could sound quite different when she was present. I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;ll be good or bad, I guess we&rsquo;ll find out another week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Ministries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maranatha has Sunday School at 9:00 - we didn&rsquo;t make it to that this morning. Then they have age-segregated nurseries for children up through 4 years old during the service, and kids from 5 - 9 or so are dismissed to a Children&rsquo;s Church during the sermon time.</li>
<li>Laura and Addie both seemed to enjoy their mornings. The rooms were big and there were several kids in each room. Haven&rsquo;t heard much else from either of them about it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pastor Aaron is on a sermon series through the book of Isaiah. This week was chapter 32. At a chapter a week he has another 7 or so months to go.</li>
<li>The sermon was maybe 40 - 45 minutes long, but good, solid stuff. Pastor Aaron seems to pretty much have one speed, but it&rsquo;s energetic and not hard to listen to.</li>
<li>The Gospel was clearly present in the message, as was a reminder of the hope that we have in God&rsquo;s kingdom that will be established for eternity.</li>
<li>After <a href="/08/10/an-end-times-deal-breaker/">avoiding one church on our list</a> because of their strident insistence on a particular sort of end-times views, it was good to hear from the pulpit (and I paraphrase here) that &lsquo;a lot of Bible-believing people have come up with a lot of Bible-believing ideas about how the end times will happen, but in reality we don&rsquo;t really know for certain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The congregation was a fairly mixed age there at Maranatha; there were lots of families with young children, but there were also a bunch of teenagers and a fair number of older folks. Good to see the variety.</li>
<li>On the whole, people weren&rsquo;t unfriendly, but weren&rsquo;t perhaps as purposefully outgoing as the folks at Stonebridge were when we visited there. Outside of the folks we already knew (and the few people that they introduced us to), no one specifically came up to greet and welcome us. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Pastor Aaron finding us and shepherding us around, I got the feeling we would&rsquo;ve had to ask a bunch of questions and more or less find our own way around to get the girls down to the children&rsquo;s ministries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The church sanctuary is interesting; they have adapted what was obviously once a rather long, narrow sanctuary and turned the whole thing sideways. This makes the sanctuary very wide (4 rows of pews wide or so) but only about 6 rows deep. It works pretty well.</li>
<li>In general, the church feels like they&rsquo;ve outgrown their building but don&rsquo;t have a solution for what to do next. The sanctuary wasn&rsquo;t overly full this morning, but I can see where it could be. The stage felt somewhat cramped with the whole worship team up there. The basement has temporary walls set up to make the children&rsquo;s classrooms, and the doors are short - like 6-foot-high short. Their website tells me that they had a baptismal service last week at a church several miles away, since they don&rsquo;t have the facilities at their own building.</li>
<li>It looks like there&rsquo;s a lot of good stuff going on at Maranatha. There&rsquo;s an emphasis on small groups, an apparent focus on missions, and a seeming dedication to qualified leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with Stonebridge a few weeks ago, it&rsquo;s just impossible to get a full impression and make any sort of decision based on only attending for one Sunday. Next week we&rsquo;ll be out of town, but I expect that the following week we&rsquo;ll be back at Maranatha to give it another shot. Thanks to Aaron and the whole group there at Maranatha for a good Sunday morning.</p>

			 <p>So much has been said by so many this morning that I don&rsquo;t really have anything brilliant to add. Still, I&rsquo;ll consolidate a few thoughts here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scene at Grant Park in Chicago last night was amazing. Just amazing.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s good to have an election decided decisively. No nightmare like the month of November 2000 this time.</li>
<li>To those of you who supported Obama: his presidency won&rsquo;t be as awesome as most of you think.</li>
<li>To those of you who opposed Obama: his presidency won&rsquo;t be as terrible as most of you think.</li>
<li>As Christians, it is our responsibility to pray for, respect, honor, and obey our leaders.</li>
<li>We owe it to President-elect Obama to put aside our cynicism for a while, to assume the best instead of the worst.</li>
<li>The kingdom we wait expectantly for is not an earthly kingdom.</li>

			 <p>The <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/bob-is-angry-on-election-day">Internet Monk&rsquo;s latest post</a> deserves more than just a bullet in my overnight links.</p>
<p>Michael Spencer describes &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;, a man he met this past summer. Bob is &ldquo;a very dedicated conservative evangelical, and a pleasant enough fellow….when he [isn&rsquo;t] angry.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob was your stereotypical culture war evangelical. He was a Jesus follower, but his passion was what was going on in America, particularly the issues we broadly call the culture war: atheistic advances in the public schools, restrictions on Christian practice in the public square, the aggressive agenda of homosexual rights advocates.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Bob was obviously devoted to Christian and conservative media, particularly radio. He believed what he heard. Dobson. Point of View. 700 Club.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know people like this. We all get multitudinous email forwards from people like this. Some of us are people like this, or have those tendencies. And here&rsquo;s iMonk&rsquo;s word for us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go live like a disciple.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It’s hard to say this, but Bob isn’t seeing the big picture. Our American culture war is not worth the demise of authentic discipleship. Trading following Christ in love, even in post-Christian times, for fighting and defensiveness, is a bad trade. Bob is frightened. Our faith says “Fear not.” Bob says prepare to fight. Our faith says prepare to love.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I am particularly impressed that these days should call us together in real community, not separate us according to Christian media audience niche. There are some helpful voices out there in the culture war, but I’d like to suggest that it’s time to listen to your pastor- assuming he’s showing you how to follow Jesus- more than James Dobson or some angrier, more paranoid manipulator of fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should really go read <a href="http://www.internetmonk.com/archive/bob-is-angry-on-election-day">the whole article</a>. Good, good stuff. Amen.</p>

			 <p>Reports of long lines at many polling places had me wondering if I would be in for a wait to vote this morning. But, at least at my polling place at the neighborhood church in Hiawatha, there was very little line. I signed the register, then signed the book next to my name, then filled in our lovely two-sided scantron form.</p>
<p>The whole thing couldn&rsquo;t have taken more than 10 minutes. There were contested races for several local positions and I found myself voting for candidates of both parties. I voted to retain a few of the local judges I&rsquo;m familiar with. When I deposited my ballot into the scanner, the readout showed that I was ballot #548 for the day so far. I can remember voting in previous elections where my ballot number was only in the 200&rsquo;s late in the day&hellip; so yeah, we&rsquo;re seeing high voter turnout.</p>
<p>Tonight I have my first work league basketball game of the season, at 7:50 pm. I&rsquo;m betting that by the time I get home and watch the election coverage, it&rsquo;ll be all over.</p>

			 <p>On an internal discussion board at my workplace today, a co-worker (who is a Christian, though a bit of the far-right cynical type) posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full up your gas tank today. And any other necessary purchases. Once the elections are over, anything that they&rsquo;ve been holding off on can now be done. I expect that the repercussions of this economic meltdown have been held at bay and international moves that will make us unpopular have been tabled until after the election.</p>

<p>To which I have (and posted) this response:</p>
<p>I refuse to live in fear.</p>
<p>Political parties, bloggers, cynics, and conspiracy theorists of all stripes use fearmongering as a motivator to try to get us to do what they want. If you&rsquo;re on one side, it&rsquo;s fear of gays, liberals, taxes, big government, and athiests. If you&rsquo;re on the other side, it&rsquo;s fear of theocracy, invasion of personal privacy, neocons, and big oil.</p>
<p>No more.</p>

			 <p>It seems like this election cycle started a LONG time ago. We had our caucuses in Iowa back in January, and even at that point it seemed like the campaign was getting long. By tomorrow night, though, (Lord willing,) it&rsquo;ll all be over except for the mopping up.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve managed to avoid most of the pre-election harassment that comes in the form of door-knockers and phone calls; either Iowa is polling too strongly Democrat to make it worth canvassing or our party affiliation makes us unappealing targets for last-minute solicitation. Whatever the reason, I won&rsquo;t complain.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll walk over to our neighborhood polling place (at a church only three blocks away) and cast our ballots. I&rsquo;ll cast the most mixed ballot I&rsquo;ve ever cast, supporting Obama at the top of the ticket and a mixture of Democrats and Republicans further down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m mildly optimistic that our local House race might go Republican; the incumbent, Dave Loebsack, took the seat two years ago by running out the political equivalent of a check-swing ground ball, and making it in safely as the voters kicked out long-time nominal Republican Jim Leach in a fit of anti-Bush pique. I heard the Republican candidate speak back at the caucus in January, and she&rsquo;s a fireball. While Dr. Marianette Miller-Meeks has a name that might (unfortunately, for a politician) suggest that she has strings to be pulled, she would be a fine representative for Iowa in Washington.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the end of Chris&rsquo;s endorsements for the election. Now, just because it&rsquo;s more fun this way, a prediction or two.</p>
<ul>
<li>Obama will win the election handily, with massive voter turnout making the difference.</li>
<li>The Democrats won&rsquo;t quite hit 60 seats in the Senate, driving them to woo Joe Lieberman back to the Democratic caucus in spite of the fact he endorsed McCain.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, regardless of who wins, I will pray that God grant our new leaders wisdom and integrity. There is peace to be found in knowing that God is sovereign.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Have you heard that there&rsquo;s an election coming up soon? So has WaterBrook Publishing, apparently, because they timed this blog review giveaway to fall just before the 2008 presidential election. Which brings me today to review <em>How Would Jesus Vote? A Christian Perspective on the Issues</em>, written by the late Dr. D. James Kennedy and Jerry Newcombe. Kennedy was the senior minister at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Ft. Lauderdale, FL, and Newcombe is a television producer for Coral Ridge and a frequent co-author. I will admit to being skeptical about the book when I was invited to do the review; in general I feel that the &ldquo;Religious Right&rdquo; has done far more harm to the name of Christ than it has accomplished with its political machinations over the past 20 years. But I figured it was worth a read.</p>
<p>Chapter One of <em>HWJV?</em> asks, appropriately enough, would Jesus even have His followers vote at all? Unsurprisingly, it concludes that yes, He would, based primarily on the &ldquo;render unto Caesar&rdquo; command in Luke 20. Taking it even a step further, the authors claim that it is primarily <em>the Christians'</em> fault that America&rsquo;s morality has taken a downturn in the past century; if only Christians had been more involved politically, they say, and been more effective at &ldquo;legislating our morality&rdquo;, things would be much different today.</p>
<p>Part Two of <em>HWJV?</em> addresses &ldquo;The Issues&rdquo;, devoting a chapters to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matters of life and death (Abortion, stem cells, suicide, euthanasia)</li>
<li>The Death Penalty</li>
<li>War - can it ever be justified?</li>
<li>Education and the schools</li>
<li>Economic Concerns</li>
<li>Health-care issues</li>
<li>The environment and climate change</li>
<li>Immigration and racial predjudice</li>
<li>Protection of marriage</li>
<li>Judicial Activism</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a pretty fair swath of topics that surround most elections, and I was looking forward to having them dealt with in a thoughtful manner. I was quite disappointed, then, to read the chapters and find that they are little more than a regurgitation of the &ldquo;Religious Right&rdquo; talking points that you would hear from Focus on the Family, the Christian Coalition, or any similar religious conservative political group. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>After telling us in Chapter 3 that he will never tell folks who he&rsquo;s voting for, Dr. Kennedy says in Chapter 4 that he &ldquo;cannot support [a] person&rdquo; who is &ldquo;for the pro-choice position&rdquo;, saying that &ldquo;this one issue of life trumps all others&rdquo;. Doesn&rsquo;t leave much question who he&rsquo;s supporting now, does it?</li>
<li>After saying, though, that the &ldquo;issue of life trumps all others&rdquo;, he goes on to conclude that the death penalty is an appropriate deterrent for crime and that &ldquo;only by misunderstanding the Bible&hellip; could one conclude that Jesus would oppose the death penalty.&rdquo;</li>
<li>In the chapter on education, the authors detail the decline of the public education system in America and stunningly conclude that &ldquo;as long as God continues to be barred from our public schools, the public-education system will continue to falter.&rdquo;</li>
<li>On health-care, the authors conclude that Jesus would &ldquo;be concerned&rdquo; about the plight of the uninsured, but that He would not favor government involvement in health care, not only because of government inefficiency, but also because it would &ldquo;impose an anti-Christian ethic, such as forcing abortions on handicapped unborn children or forcing euthanasia on the weak&rdquo;.</li>
<li>On the environment, I&rsquo;ll give them credit for a slightly more nuanced position than I would&rsquo;ve expected; the authors say that it&rsquo;s important we care for our environment, but suggest that there are more practical ways to do that than the massive programs proposed to stop &ldquo;global warming&rdquo;.</li>
<li>On immigration, the authors pull a fair number of examples from the Old Testament claiming that God had Israel deal with two groups of immigrants differently, treating those who came to adapt and become Israelites <em>as</em> Israelites, while opposing those who came in as &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;.</li>
<li>On judicial activism, the authors speak harshly against the Senate that railroaded Robert Bork and tried to destroy Clarence Thomas, but in the end conclude that they can&rsquo;t say &ldquo;whether Jesus would prefer judges who hold strictly to the constitution&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most disturbing things to be in <em>HWJV?</em> was the way the authors mangled Scripture interpretations in support of their views. No place was this more evident than in the chapter on the economy and taxes. After arguing the standard Republican platform (that big businesses are good because they create jobs, and that it&rsquo;s damaging to tax them more heavily) for the better part of the chapter, they then stunningly support this by quoting Matthew 23:11: &ldquo;The greatest among you will be your servant.&rdquo; So, they say, look at Henry Ford as an example. He was a great, rich man, but in doing so he enriched the lives, and thus served, many others.</p>
<p>I want to explore that a little bit more. Matthew 23 is a chapter in which Jesus chastises the Pharisees and religious leaders for their pride, ambition, and hypocrisy. In context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8&quot;But you are not to be called &lsquo;Rabbi,&rsquo; for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. 9And do not call anyone on earth &lsquo;father,&rsquo; for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. 10Nor are you to be called &lsquo;teacher,&rsquo; for you have one Teacher, the Christ.[b] 11The greatest among you will be your servant. 12For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
- Matt 23:8-12, NIV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the authors picked a single verse from a chapter in which Jesus is telling us that the values of the kingdom are inverted, that status and position don&rsquo;t matter, but that humility and servanthood do&hellip; and they use that single verse to try to prove that God would have us reduce taxes on &ldquo;big business&rdquo;, because those rich are doing us all a service. Did they completely miss the irony here?</p>
<p>I had hopes for <em>How Would Jesus Vote?</em>, hopes that it would be a thoughtful consideration of the issues, a step beyond the talking points that are rehashed on the radio and the blogosphere every day, hopes that the authors would acknowledge and consider that there are Christians, deeply devout, serious, thoughtful Christians, who disagree with nearly every &ldquo;Religious Right&rdquo; tenet. Instead the book turned out to be just more of the same stuff we hear every election cycle from those would would have us believe the lie, as <a href="http://derekwebb.net/song-vault/a-king-and-a-kingdom/">Derek Webb wrote</a>, that &ldquo;Jesus was a white, middle-class Republican&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The link to Amazon is included here because it&rsquo;s part of the reviewing agreement; however, I&rsquo;d suggest you spend your money and time on some other, more thoughtful book.</p>

			 <p>During an online conversation with <a href="http://lrpresley.wordpress.com">Lydia</a> this morning I was chiding for her unfamiliarity with Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Three Little Maids from School Are We&rdquo;. Just to get everyone on the same page, here it is:</p>
<p>But then I got to thinking about <em>my</em> familiarity with Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, which leads me to an embarrassing admission: most of my familiarity with the music of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan comes from two sources: the movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/">Chariots of Fire</a></em>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Feare">&ldquo;Cape Feare&rdquo; episode</a> of <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Chariots of Fire</em>, as I recall, one of the main characters is interested in an actress who is playing one of the three little maids in <em>The Mikado</em>. There&rsquo;s also a scene when the olympic team is traveling on the ship and they&rsquo;re singing Gilbert &amp; Sullivan songs around the piano. (The scene always sticks in my mind because the audio is just off - the piano chord sounds a split-second before the actor&rsquo;s hand hits the keys.)</p>
<p>In <em>The Simpsons</em>, the villain Sideshow Bob tracks down the Simpson family (who were living on a houseboat in a witness relocation program), ties up the parents, and is just about to kill Bart. Bart stalls Sideshow Bob by challenging him to sing the entire score of <em>The Pirates of Penzance H.M.S. Pinafore (thanks for the correction, Jamie!)</em>. Bob can&rsquo;t resist the challenge and so sings and sings and sings while the boat floats down the river, into town, and to the authorities.</p>
<p>I really should take some time to become more familiar with these guys.</p>

			 <p>It always seems to be the bitter, cold, rainy days. Yesterday morning I took my familiar perch behind the piano at Noelridge as an aging group of family and friends gathered to remember the life of a dear lady who passed away last week. Save for a few grandchildren present, at age 31 I was easily the youngest person in the room, and my position at the piano gave me forty minutes' opportunity to study the faces of those assembled.</p>
<p>It was a wrinkled and care-worn group gathered yesterday; five pews filled with family grieving a loss forseen for some time now during battles with cancer, a dozen more pews of friends, each remembering happier times. Fairlene was remembered as a &ldquo;feisty&rdquo; woman whose love for family and desire to serve could be seen in the faces of her sons as they sang &ldquo;Amazing Grace&rdquo;, and in the pulpit that she and her husband hand-crafted for the church sanctuary. Her death was in many ways a sorrow - as deaths always are - but in many ways a relief; Fairlene is now free from her pain and suffering and is rejoicing in the presence of God.</p>
<p>As I looked around the room I saw faces that reminded me of other similar gatherings. There in the back was Dave, who sat in the same front row grieving a wife lost to cancer seven years ago. A row nearer sat Wanda, remembering her husband who has been with the Lord for several years now. Each one came in quietly, shared the sorrow and memories, sang the hymns of trust and assurance, and then bundled up to face the bitter wind at the grave site.</p>
<p>My schedule forced me to make an exit at this point, but I knew how the day would continue. Soon they would return to the church for the lunch awaiting them in the basement fellowship hall, and as the sandwiches, salads, jellos, and desserts were eaten the quietness of grief would slowly be replaced by the happier babble of life, the telling of stories, the shrieking of small children, the laughter at the memory of times past. And this, too, is life. Weeping may last for the night, but joy comes in the morning.</p>
<p>This morning the sky was clear as the sun came up, and it gave a hint of hope to the cold air. Fairlene&rsquo;s hopes were fulfilled on Thursday night as she left us to be with her Savior. In the words of the psalmist that were read yesterday: &ldquo;The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away.&rdquo; We can though, like Fairlene, have hope in the God who has been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>

			 <p>Lately I&rsquo;ve had a quote from <em>Chuck</em> (a rather fun TV show on NBC Mondays) set as my IM status message. (Oh, it&rsquo;s also at the top of my blog header.) In the show, Chuck complains that it&rsquo;d never work to have a relationship with his hot love interest Sarah, because she&rsquo;s a CIA agent, and he says he&rsquo;d try calling her, and she wouldn&rsquo;t be available because she&rsquo;d be &ldquo;off somewhere in Paraguay quelling revolution with a fork&hellip;&rdquo; I loved it. What a great line.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been my IM status for a week or so now. And every time Ryan starts a chat, he starts it out this way: &ldquo;viva! viva! viva!&rdquo;. (The first time he followed up with &ldquo;fork that!&rdquo; :-) )</p>
<p>For Ryan, I have but three words, and I&rsquo;ll even make &lsquo;em Spanish: ¡Si se puede!</p>

			 <p>After deciding early in the week that Cedar Valley Bible was off our short list, we spent a lot of time talking about where we might go next. We know the other place we definitely want to try out is <a href="http://www.maranathabible.org">Maranatha Bible Church</a>, so we tentatively decided last night that we&rsquo;d head there this morning.</p>
<p>Then last night Laura decided she didn&rsquo;t want to sleep. From 3:00 until 5:00 she was awake in our room at least four times. Needless to say, Becky and I didn&rsquo;t get a lot of sleep. Finally Laura went to sleep and slept in until 8:00. As I write this at 9:15, Becky is still sleeping. Given that we&rsquo;d need to leave the house in 30 minutes to get to Maranatha on time, I think we&rsquo;ll be cashing it in this morning and giving it another shot next week. Part of me feels guilty for not getting to church; the other part of me is happy that we have the freedom to just rest when we need to. God is good.</p>

			 <p>I switched over from my usual podcasts and indie rock this morning to give some iPod love to a genre I&rsquo;ve ignored far too much as of late: classical piano. To be more specific: Bach and Chopin. What a fantastic way to start the morning.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve spent innumerable hours over the past 20+ years with my backside on a piano bench and my fingers hacking away at some composer or another. And ever since I was a kid, let&rsquo;s face it, I did a lot of hacking. Sure, I had assigned pieces that I was supposed to practice every day. But more often than not what I&rsquo;d do is just play through those pieces once or twice, then put them down and move on to something far too hard for me, say, a Rachmaninoff piano concerto or a Chopin <em>Ballade</em> or something by Debussy. The weeks when I actually <em>did</em> practice my lesson, my teacher was always blown away by my progress. I wonder at times how well I would&rsquo;ve progressed if I&rsquo;d practice like he expected.</p>
<p>When you have small children, though, the amount of time available for you to practice the piano goes down quite a bit. First, they take up your time directly. Second, they go to sleep early and playing the piano would wake them up. So I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of practicing in the past few years. Occasionally I&rsquo;d pull out a book and hack through a little bit of Rachmaninoff, but that has been about it. If I get a chance to sit down at a piano somewhere else, I usually just improvise for a while, though it has been frightening just how much I remember of Beethoven Sonatas and Bach Fugues that I learned back in high school.</p>
<p>The other night I sat down at the piano after dinner and actually practiced a new piece. Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s <em>Polichinelle</em> Op. 3 No. 4, if you really care. (You can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsrbCoHLO6c">hear Rachmaninoff himself perform it on YouTube</a>.) It&rsquo;s difficult enough that I can&rsquo;t just sight read through it at full speed, but not so difficult that I get disheartened trying to practice. I am hoping that I can actually put a little time into it, commit it to memory, and eventually have something new to play on occasion, rather than just murdering a section from Chopin&rsquo;s <em>Ballade #1</em> like I usually do.</p>
<p>How I do love my piano music.</p>

<p>More likely we&rsquo;ll sit down with the phonebook, newspaper, or some other reference list and work through the short list again to figure out what places we might have missed&hellip; then we&rsquo;ll go from there. Still praying for guidance on a daily basis.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://lrpresley.wordpress.com">Lydia</a> asked for it, so here it is&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained - I prefer to boil a couple of chicken breasts and shred those in place of the canned chicken</li>
<li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
<li>1 cup Ranch dressing</li>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong> Heat chicken and hot sauce in a skillet over medium heat, until heated through. Stir in cream cheese and ranch dressing. Cook, stirring until well blended and warm.</p>
<p>Mix in half of the shredded cheese, and transfer the mixture to a slow cooker. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top, cover, and cook on Low setting until hot and bubbly. Serve with celery sticks and crackers or tortilla chips or, my favorite: Fritos Scoops.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/10/20/an-endtimes-dealbreaker.html">An end-times deal-breaker</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So <a href="/08/10/the-church-search-week-2/">yesterday afternoon I noted</a> that the next church on our short list for visiting during the Church Search was probably <a href="http://www.cedarvalley.org">Cedar Valley Bible Church</a>. I know a few folks there, including the couple that has brought Andrew Peterson and company to town twice for concerts. I&rsquo;ve been to a wedding there, too, and my overall impression was that the church might be a little further over into the conservative homeschooling culture than I&rsquo;d be comfortable with, but then, it might be OK.</p>
<p>The only other <a href="/08/09/beginning-the-church-search/">note I&rsquo;d made</a> about Cedar Valley thus far was when perusing their <a href="http://cedarvalley.org/doctrinalstatement.shtml">Doctrinal Statement</a> online, it seemed to me that they had a far more detailed and lengthy statement on the End Times than do most doctrinal statements I&rsquo;ve read. A very literal, pre-trib, dispensational sort of end times view. Still, as of yesterday, the church was still on my short list.</p>
<p>Then last night I cruised on over to the Cedar Valley website again to check out Sunday morning service times, and I noted this link on the sidebar: &ldquo;<a href="http://cedarvalley.org/secondcomingconference.shtml">2008 Second Coming Conference</a>&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s right, in November Cedar Valley Bible will be bringing in a special speaker from <a href="http://www.foi.org/">Friends of Israel</a> to speak three times over two days. The topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Close to Construction&rdquo; - Presentation on the movement in Israel to rebuild the Temple and how it could fit into Bible prophecy.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pre-Tribulation Rapture&rdquo; - A look at some different views of the rapture along with Biblical proof for the pre-tribulation position.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Signs of the Times&rdquo; - Biblical evidence that we are now living in the end times.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just about a deal-breaker for me. Let me explain a little bit why.</p>
<p>I grew up in what I&rsquo;d consider a pretty standard set of evangelical churches. We attended a C&amp;MA church for a while in Fremont, NE, then <a href="http://www.gracebiblegranbury.com">a Bible church</a> in Granbury, TX. I got the basic dispensational teaching on the end times - basically, <em>Left Behind</em> without all the dramatic stuff that made LaHaye and Jenkins best-sellers. Imminent rapture, followed by a 7-year tribulation, followed by Christ&rsquo;s return for 1000 years, followed by Satan being let loose again on the earth, followed by another clean-up and the ultimate destruction of the earth and creation of a new one, etc. Most of the time I was just confused by it. Maybe it was partly my practical engineering nature - we&rsquo;re not gonna know what&rsquo;s happening until it&rsquo;s done, right? So who really cares?</p>
<p>I stayed basically in that theological position until reading N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>Surprised by Hope</em> a year ago. In <em>Surprised by Hope,</em> Wright explains, among other things, the amillennial position on end times in a way that actually made sense to me. It turns out there is a whole &lsquo;nother way to interpret the passages in Peter, Thessalonians, and Revelation that I had never been introduced to. And that there were legitimate, reasonable Christians who believed it. Talk about an eye-opener. Since then I&rsquo;ve read a couple of books by Kim Riddlebarger on amillennialism, which too have been helpful. At the moment I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m at the point of leaning toward an amillennial position, but feeling no need to be dogmatic about it. There are far more important things to get worked up about than the end times.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my end-times deal-breaker with Cedar Valley Bible. This (apparently second-annual) &ldquo;Second Coming Conference&rdquo; shows me that they&rsquo;re very interested in being dogmatic about a pre-trib dispensational end-times viewpoint. And while I&rsquo;m OK with them believing that (heck, <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>, <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago</a>, and <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com">Stonebridge</a> all have the word &ldquo;premillennial&rdquo; in their doctrinal statements), I&rsquo;m not really OK with a church being dogmatic about it. That just won&rsquo;t work for me.</p>
<p>Becky and I had a good talk about end-times stuff last night and why I feel this way about it. I don&rsquo;t know that we&rsquo;ve decided anything yet, but I&rsquo;m really leaning toward taking Cedar Valley off our list.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/10/19/the-church-search.html">The Church Search, Week 2</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Week 2 of the Church Search took us back to <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com">Stonebridge Church</a> for the second week in a row. (We kinda figure it&rsquo;ll take at least a few weeks at any given place to really be able to make some sort of reasonable judgment on things.) We got out the door five minutes earlier this morning, leaving at 8:30 for a 9:00 service. We were there in 15 minutes, but the child check-in desk was quite a bit crazy this morning, so we still ended up not getting in to the sanctuary until the worship band had just about finished the opening song. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll get the check-in stuff figured out soon.</p>
<p>Some continued/revised impressions carrying on from last week:</p>
<ul>
<li>The folks seem quite friendly, and I&rsquo;m enthusiastic about the age range I see. There is a good spread of old, young, teenagers, and children.</li>
<li>A lot of the music is unfamiliar, but it&rsquo;s pretty solid stuff. During each song I&rsquo;d be wondering &ldquo;man, where did this song come from?&rdquo; and then the last slide would have the author&rsquo;s name and I&rsquo;d recognize it. The last song of the service was written by Bebo Norman and Mitch Dane and I thought hey, I&rsquo;ve met Mitch, even had lunch with him. Kinda cool.</li>
<li>The worship team was a little bit scant this week - fewer vocalists, no keyboard player at all. Makes me wonder how many folks the worship pastor actually has signed up, if he&rsquo;s struggling to get people. If we were there I&rsquo;d like to participate, just not be leading the team.</li>
<li>Jeff Holland&rsquo;s doppelganger of a young adult pastor was supposed to be preaching, but apparently came down with a nasty cold yesterday. So, the senior pastor got to wing it, but still gave us a good sermon on Psalm 23. Enjoyed it.</li>
<li>The one thing I&rsquo;ll gripe about the sermon, and I hassled Richard at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a> for the same thing: pastors that somehow refuse to use contractions when preaching. So far as I know, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly unholy about &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;won&rsquo;t&rsquo;, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo;, and the like, but Pastor Richard at Noelridge and Pastor Randy at Stonebridge both seem to banish them from their vocabulary as soon as they get behind the pulpit. Anybody else get that from their pastors?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next week Stonebridge is doing their official dedication of the new building, and they&rsquo;re expecting a LOT of folks. They&rsquo;ve actually gone door-to-door to everyone within a one-mile radius of the church dropping off small gift bags and inviting folks to visit. If it&rsquo;s gonna be that crazy, we&rsquo;ll probably take next week to visit the next church on our list. Not exactly sure yet which church that&rsquo;ll be, but I&rsquo;m kinda guessing <a href="http://www.cedarvalley.org">Cedar Valley Bible</a>.</p>
<p>It may be a little early to come to conclusions about Stonebridge after only two weeks, but my interim conclusion is that I like it, a lot. There&rsquo;s a lot of good things going on there, a lot of good attitudes about things I think are important, and good teaching coming from the pulpit. If all the churches we visit are this good, it&rsquo;s gonna be a difficult decision.</p>

<p>So this morning, after one false start (didn&rsquo;t grind the beans finely enough the first time), I&rsquo;ve got a pot of coffee that tastes awfully close to what I drink down at BA when I visit there. Very good stuff. At some point maybe I&rsquo;ll try out the french press and be a true coffee snob, but for now this stuff is working for me just fine.</p>

			 <p>It is becoming more and more clear to me lately how we are created for community, and how much we need that community to live our lives. When we <a href="/08/09/changes-coming/">announced a month ago</a> (though it seems like it has been much longer) that we were leaving <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi Church</a>, the primary reasons were a need to recalibrate and reprioritize. What I have started to see in the past month is how much the need for community played into our busyness and weariness.</p>
<p>Let me back up just a bit. While it was by no means the beginning of the issue, Becky and I had a long discussion on the way home from an <a href="http://www.andyosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> concert earlier this summer. (I&rsquo;m stunned that I didn&rsquo;t blog about it at the time, but I did <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157607289171826/">post pictures to Flickr</a>.) Andy introduced his song <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/song-vault/overdressed/hold-the-light/">&ldquo;Hold the Light&rdquo;</a>, as usual, by telling the story about his small group. They have gathered in somebody&rsquo;s backyard every week for a couple of years, sharing life stories, praying, encouraging, and living life together. It&rsquo;s a powerful song, and a powerful story. On the long drive home I found myself getting jealous of my friend Andy. How I would love to have a group of folks like that.</p>
<p>Over the past several years as a church leader I&rsquo;ve been a part of dozens of discussions where we&rsquo;ve talked about building community. How do we build community? We know we need it. How do we make it happen? Too often the solution seemed to be another program. Things like &ldquo;let&rsquo;s organize a small group book study&rdquo; or &ldquo;let&rsquo;s start a group based around this particular interest&rdquo;. We&rsquo;d try to find leaders for the group, put out a signup list, and then get frustrated because the same people who were asking for community weren&rsquo;t signing up for stuff.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I think we, and many churches, have made the mistake: we focus so much time and energy on church programs that we rob ourselves of the time to just live life together. The best friendships and most supportive community I&rsquo;ve experienced in my life haven&rsquo;t come out of any church program; they&rsquo;ve come from people deciding to get together around meals and activities to just live life. Meeting up at someone&rsquo;s home to play basketball, eat a meal, watch football on TV. Taking off on the spur of the moment to help someone move a piece of furniture. Taking a Saturday to help someone move to a new house. What saddens me is how many times we&rsquo;ve <em>not</em> done things like this because we were too busy - and usually too busy with church stuff.</p>
<p>This is easy to lament, but harder to correct. We&rsquo;ve taken the first step by the only method we could see that would work. Now we&rsquo;re looking for another church, and the place we&rsquo;re looking for will need to place a high priority on this sort of community. I&rsquo;m praying every day that God helps us find it.</p>

			 <p>My brother Ryan has been working full-time as an Obama campaign volunteer for the past few weeks, and likely will until the election. He wrote this op-ed and asked if I&rsquo;d want to post it here. So here ya go, bro.</p>
<p>Feel free to interact in the comments. I&rsquo;ll try to get Ryan to come around and answer questions.</p>
<p>-&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Who, me?</strong> <em>by Ryan Hubbs</em></p>
<p>Barack Obama has repeatedly made the statement that “this campaign is not about me.” McCain’s call to “Country First” echoes a similar sentiment. However, each candidate, by virtue of their negative attacks in recent weeks, seems convinced that the election is, at least in part, about their respective opponent. Which presents the question: who is this election about, anyway?</p>
<p>Senator Obama has an incredibly compelling – and uniquely American - personal narrative that transcends some of our deepest national scars. Senator McCain has a long and honorable record of service and sacrifice for his country. And both candidates, despite their magnified circumstances, are simply two Americans among millions of others who have fought, struggled, worked, and sacrificed against the odds.</p>
<p>Senator Obama, I believe, holds the better position on the issues; he recognizes that we have the opportunity to lead the world in developing the future of energy, that we have a moral and economic imperative to improve the access to and efficiency of our healthcare system, and that our current foreign policy is misguided and counterproductive. All of which are ideas the American people largely support - and Obama unquestionably possesses the superior ability to articulate his positions.</p>
<p>Some I’ve spoken with abroad – with the “<a href="http://www.economist.com/vote2008">outsiders perspective</a>” – are surprised that the race is as close as it is. Many McCain supporters back the candidate due purely to their support for his political positions. But there is a large segment of America wants to vote for a candidate who is “like them,” and there are millions of Americans who will never be able to identify with Obama’s Harvard-educated, multi-racial, professorial persona. But even the person who can identify the least with Obama possesses a keen sense of the motivations that a candidate is trying to tap into in order to gain their support.</p>
<p>His impressive abilities aside, Senator Obama’s ideas and outlook are what brought him from the relative obscurity of the Illinois legislature to the world stage in a few short years. His appeal to our better instincts – the “Audacity of Hope” - and assertion that “what is wrong with America can be solved by what is right with America” mirrored his own personal story and tapped into something profound in the American psyche, giving us reason to believe that we could, against the odds, escape the infighting and cynicism that is suffocating our country and achieve something better. Because of this appeal to our better instincts, though, Obama - consciously or not – dedicated himself to playing by a better set of rules. McCain has not.</p>
<p>The McCain camp is currently banking their success on the appeal to peoples’ baser instincts. The absence of positive <a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/10/08/mccain-wages-negative-tv-ad-campaign-against-obama.html">advertising</a> in swing states mirrors the negativity demonstrated at his town halls, which has been tipping from frustration to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/10/former-mccain-strategist_n_133523.html">mob-like anger</a>. Even the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/12/AR2008101201956.html">head of McCain’s Virginia campaign</a> compared Senator Obama to Osama bin Laden, stating, “they both have friends who have bombed the Pentagon.” A comparison this ludicrous would be laughable if it were not so potentially <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/opinion/12rich.html">dangerous</a>. The assertion that Obama’s participation on a charity board with Bill Ayers – a current university professor and former Chicago “Citizen of the Year” who was a violent ‘60s radical during Barack’s childhood – links Obama to bin Laden is as ignorant and baseless as suggesting that Chairman Mao and John McCain are comrades because of their mutual ties to Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Obama campaign, good as it has been, has missed some opportunities. When McCain first aired his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOrmOvHysdU">now infamous “Celebrity” ad</a> painting Obama as nothing more than a tabloid starlet, disparaging his energy plan and casting doubt on his leadership abilities, Obama had a great opportunity to elevate the situation by focusing on the issues and refusing to get drawn in to the politics of personal destruction. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVMF-lqFyPc">retaliatory ad</a> dubbing McCain a “Washington Celebrity” showed a willingness to let McCain set the tone of their campaign, which didn’t help burnish Obama’s still developing leadership credentials. Obama is taking a higher road than his opponent by continuing to run a large number of positive ads – but his campaign is also running several times more TV spots than McCain.</p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom of campaign strategists – one of our more cynical classes - is that failing to respond to attacks in-kind is political suicide. Attacks are inevitable though, and whether we are governing a country or simply ourselves, our response to unfair and malicious attacks can do more harm than the attacks themselves. Iraq and Guantanamo, for example, have cost us more in lives, money, moral authority, and, arguably, national morale than the attacks of 9/11. There is a way to respond to destructive actions without emulating the outlook and approach of the attacker, and the leader of the free world can’t wait for their opponents’ consent to work towards something better.</p>
<p>While I believe that Obama has the superior solutions to our national problems, the starkest, most accessible distinction that Obama can draw in this final push is to take every available opportunity to encourage people to vote for him rather than to against his opponent. His appeal to our better instincts has propelled him to one of the highest positions in the country, and personal story and skills have given him a once-in-a-generation chance to transcend some very deep-seated divides, change the nature of the political discourse, and to repudiate the prevailing Lee Atwater principle that “<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081020/dambrosio">people vote their fears.</a>” Acquiescing to the prevailing political norms, while it may not change the outcome of the election, could reduce his potential to that of an above-average national politician and hurt his ability to inclusively govern once in office, which will be essential in creating lasting, positive change in America.</p>
<p>The simple answer is that this campaign is about us. While there are a regrettably large number of exceptions, most Americans want the chance to believe in something better, to have a reason to cast their ballot in support of their hopes rather than their fears. It’s why Obama is where he is. And I sincerely hope that he takes the “risk” of giving America every opportunity he has to do that the rest of the way. After all, it’s not about him anyway.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Next up for review, courtesy of WaterBrook Press, is <em>Churched: One Kid&rsquo;s Journey Toward God Despite a Holy Mess</em> by <a href="http://www.matthewpaulturner.com">Matthew Paul Turner</a>. Turner is a speaker, author, and former editor of <em>CCM</em> Magazine. <em>Churched</em> is written as a memoir of Turner&rsquo;s growing up in a independent fundamental Baptist church.</p>
<p>In what will feel familiar to anyone who has been around that sort of church, Turner tells stories about dressing the part (complete with clip-on tie) and getting his first &ldquo;Baptist haircut&rdquo; (only a flat-top will do!), paints pictures of weird Sunday School teachers and loud, aggressive preachers, and who can forget the weekly altar calls? The stories hit a humorous note and manage to recount the frustrating times without coming across as cynical or cutting. In chapter 8 he recounts a third-grade Sunday School teacher named Moose teaching about hell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[One morning] he looked at us and screamed, &ldquo;BOYS AND GIRLS, DO YOU KNOW HOW HOT HELL IS?&rdquo; He was serious, as if speaking to a room full of Christian meteorologists. &ldquo;DOES ANYBODY HERE KNOW?&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As soon as Moose asked the question, I looked at my friend Angie. If anybody in our Sunday school class had visited hell and remembered to take a thermometer, it would be her. Not only was Angie always well prepared and organized, but she also claimed to make frequent visits to farr off places when she slept. One time, during a nap, we heard her mumbling in tongues. When she woke up, she told us she had taken a vacation to Montreal and been able to speak in French. When she saw me looking at her, she raised her hand.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;Mr. Moose, the temperature of hell is 666 degrees,&rdquo; said Angie with the enthusiastic confidence of a demon. &ldquo;Everybody knows that! Or should.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I thought her answer was brilliant - possibly even correct - despite the fact i never believed she&rsquo;d gone to Montreal.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Moose grew quiet. He didn&rsquo;t tell Angie she was wrong, but he didn&rsquo;t tell her she was right either. He just walked over to the door and shut off the lights. Moose&rsquo;s Sunday school helper, Penny, placed large sheets of fabric underneath both of the doors to block the light coming in. The room became almost black. Moose stood behind his pulpit and found his Dollar General bag.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;This morning, I want to talk to you about hell.&rdquo; His voice was quiet and low. He wanted it to sound spooky, and it did. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s hell like? It&rsquo;s black down there. Much blacker than what you&rsquo;re experiencing right now. Imagine a black so thick you can almost feel it. That&rsquo;s what hell is like.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I heard Moose rummaging through his paper sack and then the distinct sound of a Play button being pushed on a tape recorder. The crackling noise of the tape began. And then voices.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot down here!&rdquo; said the tape recorder. &ldquo;We are thirsty! Very thirsty. We need Jesus.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;Do you hear that, boys and girls?&rdquo; asked Moose. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you would hear in hell. There would be a lot more of them, though. And some of the voices you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to understand because they&rsquo;re from other countries.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
While I assumed Moose was right, that his tape of sound effects could have been a live audio recording of hell, I was also convinced that if I closed my eyes during the church fellowship time, when a long line of Christians waited for Ho Hos and fruit punch, it might have sounded similar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turner&rsquo;s stories are amusing and will provide laughs, grimaces, and knowing nods along the way. I felt like the story ended too soon, though. I would&rsquo;ve liked to hear more about how Turner found his way out of the fundamentalist culture and where he is now. Still, it was an entertaining little book.</p>

			 <p>Four years ago I started this thing called blogging, not, as they say, with a bang, but <a href="/04/10/this-is-my-first-post/">with something more akin to a whimper</a>. Since then the blog has relocated twice (from rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy to thehubbs.net/chris and finally to chrishubbs.com), undergone several theme makeovers, and has generally featured relatively mundane commentary on life, church, politics, and whatever else is on my mind.</p>
<p>Thanks to those of you who stick around to read my stuff, and thanks even more to those who interact in the comments. I wonder what this place will look like four years hence?</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago <a href="/08/09/why-i-dislike-salespeople-or-at-least-their-tactics/">I wrote about a bad experience</a> we had with an in-home sales call from <a href="http://www.rainsoftneiowa.com/">Rainsoft of NE Iowa</a>. I wrote the rant, emailed it to every Rainsoft of NE Iowa email address I could find, and that was that. Both of the email addresses I found for Rainsoft of NE Iowa bounced, and Rainsoft corporate doesn&rsquo;t list an email address on their website, so I figured that was the end of it.</p>
<p>Then last week I got a phone call from Terry Bonik, who owns Rainsoft of NE IA. He had been notified of my blog post earlier that day, apparently by someone from Rainsoft corporate. In summary, he expressed these details:</p>
<ul>
<li>He apologized profusely for the bad experience.</li>
<li>He told me that the saleswoman who visited our home has worked for him a long time and has never had another complaint like ours.</li>
<li>He agreed that three hours was far too long a visit, that they typically are only an hour in length.</li>
<li>He objected to my characterization of their giving us bottled water to taste but then not advising we buy the drinking water filtration unit as a &ldquo;bait-and-switch&rdquo;. Usually, he said, people do buy the drinking water filter, and so that&rsquo;s a sample of what they would get. Our case just happens to be the exception, since we have pretty good water here in Hiawatha.</li>
<li>He volunteered to send me a $100 Home Depot gift card in hopes that it would help remedy the situation.</li>
<li>He asked if I would be willing to take my blog post down. I told him I&rsquo;m not in the habit of taking down blog posts, but I would be willing to post an update on the situation. So here we are.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I told Mr. Bonik on the phone, I rarely complain like this, and when I do, I even more rarely expect a response. I was quite pleased to get a response from him and was happy that he included some literature about the Rainsoft products. I don&rsquo;t know how soon we&rsquo;ll be in the market for a water treatment system, but I will add Rainsoft back to my list of firms to consider.</p>
<p>Now&hellip; I wonder if it&rsquo;d be too forward to see if <a href="http://www.chrishubbsdesign.com">Chris Hubbs Design</a> could be of any help for his web-hosting issues? :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday morning we did something we haven&rsquo;t done in a couple of months now: set our alarm on a Sunday morning, got up, and got to a morning church service. (Yes, we have been to church in the past two months&hellip; but <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago</a> meets on Saturday nights.) As <a href="/08/10/the-church-search-week-1-preview/">I noted on Saturday</a>, our first stop was <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com">Stonebridge Church</a>. Stonebridge is an Evangelical Free church with an average attendance of just over 600, which, by our standards, is a large-ish church. Stonebridge just finished building a new facility; yesterday was their second Sunday in the new building. They hold two services each week, and we attended the earlier one (9:00) on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>First Impressions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They had a parking lot attendant to point people to the right row for parking. That same attendant was handing out, to folks walking in, 3x5 printed cards describing the traffic flow of the parking lot to reduce congestion between services. My logistical wife&rsquo;s heart was warmed.</li>
<li>Inside the door, the foyer was quite busy - lots of folks milling around, talking, drinking coffee. There is a hospitality booth inside the door on the right where they had free coffee and cookies, and a booth marked &ldquo;Guest&rdquo; something (I forget what, exactly) a little further into the foyer.</li>
<li>It took all of about three seconds of us standing there, taking in the scene before a man came over to greet us, introduced himself, asked if we were visiting. We said yes, and he asked if we&rsquo;d like to go find the children&rsquo;s ministries for our girls. His wife then joined him and they walked us over to the children&rsquo;s area where we signed in our kids, met their Sunday School teachers, were handed pagers so we could be buzzed if there were any issues. They were obviously still working through issues with the new facility and procedures, but they were doing a good job.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stonebridge has a rather large worship team led by a guitar-playing pastor. They had six vocalists, two guitars, a bass, and two percussionists. (A rather uncomfortable-looking pianist joined them for one song.)</li>
<li>On a whole, I liked the setup; there were enough vocalists to give it a solid, group sound. The musicians were fairly solid, and the music minister was obviously quite talented.</li>
<li>The music minister has a computer monitor/mouse right on the stage, which he was referencing a few times. At first I thought it might just be displaying the lyrics, but eventually I came to conclude that he was, a few times, turning on a track of some sort to go with the worship team. Not sure how big a fan I am of that, but it was seamless, so, good for him.</li>
<li>During the first couple of songs, the congregational singing was fairly weak. I knew the songs, so I assumed the congregation should as well. However, the music minister said something about one of the songs being &ldquo;unfamiliar&rdquo;, so maybe he was just springing new stuff on the congregation. When they sang a couple more familiar songs after the sermon, the singing was strong.</li>
<li>Overall, the songs were pretty solid, though I really would&rsquo;ve loved to have another hymn dropped into the set somewhere. Still, I won&rsquo;t judge it on a single week.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Message</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The senior pastor is preaching a series from the Psalms, which to my mind isn&rsquo;t an easy task. Sunday&rsquo;s passage was Psalm 8. I felt like he did a good job of taking David&rsquo;s psalm of praise and showing us how we could apply it to our lives. He pointed to the several passages in the New Testament that refer back to Psalm 8, too. The sermon was about 30 minutes, didn&rsquo;t feel too short or too long.</li>
<li>The pastor made an effort to bring current events into the sermon, referencing the economic situation a few times, to decent effect. He brought the Gospel into it near the end, which was welcome. There was no &ldquo;altar call&rdquo;, but he invited anyone who wanted to talk further to come down and chat with him after the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Ministries</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stonebridge has Sunday School for children of all ages (and perhaps adults, too - I&rsquo;m still fuzzy on that) during the 9:00 hour, and then has a sort of junior church for Kindergarten and below during the 10:45.</li>
<li>In a surprising, but welcome, turn of events, both girls' Sunday School classes were taught by men; Laura&rsquo;s by a grandfatherly type, Addie&rsquo;s by a guy somewhere near my age. Both classes had additional helpers, and we were told they rotate parents through the class, too; if your kid is in there you&rsquo;ll be asked to just show up as a helper once a quarter or so. (As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, that&rsquo;s a FANTASTIC strategy, on several levels. Well done!)</li>
<li>We didn&rsquo;t get much out of Addie about her class, but Laura was quite talkative about hers. First, though, all we heard was that &ldquo;they needed someone to be a princess, so I raised my hand, and I got to be the princess!&rdquo;. We were rather confused. Finally, she provided some more background: &ldquo;most of the other kids were crocodiles, and there was a baby in the river&hellip; &lsquo;cause we were talking about Moses!&rdquo; Ah, it becomes clearer!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was impressed by the friendly people at Stonebridge. The greeters at the door smiled and shook our hands on the way in, the folks who showed us around were quite nice as well. As I was waiting for Becky at one point, another woman came up to greet me, saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve met you&hellip;&rdquo;. As we talked, she acknowledged she was hedging her bets, because they&rsquo;ve just compressed from three morning services (at the old facility) to two, so some of the faces at the new services are unfamiliar.</li>
<li>I ran into a couple people I knew from work. Always interesting to encounter those folks in a quite different situation. Gives you some new perspective on them.</li>
<li>In the oddest twist, we looked across the sanctuary to see a couple who are friends of ours from Noelridge. We had a very &ldquo;what are <em>you</em> doing here?&rdquo; moment after the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of my concerns going in was the big new building. Have they really spent their money wisely? Have they gone into lots of debt? I don&rsquo;t have an answer on the debt part, but I was suitably impressed with the design and economy of their facility; they appear to have spent the money in places where it was needed without going overboard.</li>
<li>Sitting in the sanctuary (which seats about 500) I could easily have brought myself to believe I was sitting in a much larger auditorium. I had to look around and remind myself it wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> big, and there weren&rsquo;t <em>that</em> many people.</li>
<li>The sanctuary could really use some more helpful aesthetics. I&rsquo;m not complaining about the fact that it&rsquo;s obviously a metal building and you can still see some girders, bolts, ventilation ducts, and cables up in the ceiling; I&rsquo;m more disappointed that there was nothing on stage to give you any indication it was a church. There were a few banners in the back of the sanctuary, but nothing on the stage. From appearances, I could&rsquo;ve just as well been in a high school auditorium. I&rsquo;ll give them a little slack on this one - they&rsquo;re only a few weeks in to using their new facility. If they get to Christmas and the stage is still just as bare, then I&rsquo;ll have some more serious questions.</li>
<li>The Young Adult pastor is a dead ringer for Jeff Holland, and even dropped a &ldquo;y&rsquo;all&rdquo; into his talk during announcement time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, we had a quite favorable impression of Stonebridge Church from our first visit. We&rsquo;re planning on going back again next week - one week is definitely not a large enough sample on which to make decisions.</p>

			 <p>Well, tomorrow morning we officially begin our look for a new church here in the Cedar Rapids area. We&rsquo;re starting at a church called <a href="http://www.stonebridgesite.com/">Stonebridge</a>, a medium-sized Evangelical Free church on the southwest side of town. They&rsquo;re just on their second week in a new building, which actually didn&rsquo;t affect our decision to try them out&hellip; if anything we&rsquo;re tentative, figuring that it&rsquo;ll take them a few weeks in the new building to hit stride and get the kinks worked out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised by how nervous I am about visiting a new place tomorrow. I know, I&rsquo;m an engineer, I don&rsquo;t do change well. We&rsquo;ll just pray that it goes well and that God gives us some clarity in the upcoming weeks and months as to where we should land.</p>

			 <p>Thoughts from multiple discussions over the last week:</p>
<p>Most of the time, when people come to tell you that they&rsquo;re frustrated or upset with you (be it your spouse, a friend, a church member, etc), what they&rsquo;re looking for first of all isn&rsquo;t a solution to the problem; what they first want is to be heard. Down deep they know that you love them and want the best for them, but if you go immediately into problem-solving mode without having first stopped to really listen, instead of helping the situation you end up reinforcing their unhappiness.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to just keep your mouth closed, listen, and not immediately be defensive, but quiet listening and acceptance (not necessarily accepting the fault, but accepting that the hurts are real) will accomplish much.</p>
<p>I still have plenty to learn in this regard.</p>

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/10/03/thinking-through-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-10-03 09:18:18 -0500">Oct 3, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had an easy time deciding who to support for president for pretty much every election cycle since I turned 18. This year, though, the choices are not so easy. I&rsquo;m a life-long conservative with a distrust for Democrats but a growing distaste for the Republicans. Which makes this next sentence a very difficult one for me to say: unless something drastic changes between now and November 4, I&rsquo;m voting for Obama.</p>
<p>Now, let me work out some of the reasoning behind this, for my own mind if nothing else. Let&rsquo;s group it around three broad areas: economy/domestic policy, war/foreign policy, for lack of a better term, &ldquo;morality&rdquo; issues, and, finally, general personality issues.</p>
<p><strong>Economic/Domestic Policies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have a huge distaste for the tax-cut promise pandering. Both sides think that they&rsquo;ll get me to vote for them by promising me more money (i.e. &ldquo;tax cuts&rdquo;). I&rsquo;d rather they told me why they need to spend my money, and then we&rsquo;ll figure out if I can pay a little less.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not much of an economist, but it&rsquo;s clear that things are pretty hosed up right now. That&rsquo;s probably the fault of both the Bush administration and the Clinton administration before that. I don&rsquo;t think anybody has a magic bullet to fix it right now.</li>
<li>Short conclusion: this area doesn&rsquo;t really make me favor either candidate over the other.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>War/Foreign policy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As far as the war goes: I think both candidates will have to more or less do the same thing - slowly withdraw troops as Iraq becomes more stable. Both sides know that leaving immediately would cause big trouble in Iraq, so they won&rsquo;t do it. So they try to recriminate each other to score political points. Ick.</li>
<li>Maybe I&rsquo;m foolish here, but I think an Obama win would force the rest of the world, Europe especially, to take a long, hard look at themselves. It&rsquo;s been too easy for the past decade to just blame George W. Bush&rsquo;s America for all the world&rsquo;s ills. When the European&rsquo;s darling is in the White House and there are still problems in the world, they&rsquo;ll have to start looking further for how to fix problems. (Or, they&rsquo;ll just <em>still</em> blame GWB for everything&hellip; )</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Morality&rdquo; Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The biggie here is abortion. I have a real difficulty wanting to support anyone who is in favor of legalized abortion. But we have to look practically at it, too. Aside from appointing Supreme Court justices, there&rsquo;s not a lot the president can do about abortion law. I may need to just hold my nose here.</li>
<li>And about those Supreme Court justices. The traditional right-wing position is that a liberal president will get to make several appointments, thus turning the Court to the left. But let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s likely to retire from the USSC: Stevens, Rehnquist, maybe Breyer? Liberals all. Which means even if Obama replaces them with liberals, the Court&rsquo;s ideological balance won&rsquo;t change much. The conservatives Scalia, Thomas, Roberts, and Alito are comparatively young and healthy, unlikely to leave their seats any time soon. So, I see this as a non-issue.</li>
<li>Another thing I want to lump into the &ldquo;morality&rdquo; bit: health care. This is one place where I&rsquo;m increasingly convinced the hard Right has gotten it wrong for a while. We have a moral obligation to provide health care for those who can&rsquo;t afford it. Now, I&rsquo;m skeptical about the effectiveness of government-run health care, and I don&rsquo;t think the USA will end up with a fully-socialized system akin to the Canadian or British ones for a while yet, but we should find a way to make sure people are cared for. i think Obama will have a better focus in that regard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellanea</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The VP candidates: the debate last night cemented it for me. Palin isn&rsquo;t totally incompetent, but she isn&rsquo;t ready for the number 2 position, either. Let&rsquo;s put it this way: if something happened to Obama, I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid for my country to have Biden in the White House. If something happened to McCain, I&rsquo;m not sure I could say the same thing. I <em>like</em> Sarah Palin, I like the idea that someone like her could make it to this point, but the hopes that she was the great savior of the Republican party have been dashed over the past few weeks. If she wants a political future, I propose this: get that corrupt Senator Stevens out of office and let Palin replace him. Give her some time to get used to the national limelight and bone up on the issues. Then let her come back in 4 or 8 years.</li>
<li>John McCain. I respect his years of service to the country, but I&rsquo;m not really sure that we&rsquo;d get anything different from him than we&rsquo;ve had from the previous administration. All the talk of &ldquo;reforming&rdquo; is great for the stump speech, but much harder to do when you&rsquo;re in office, <em>especially</em> if you&rsquo;re dealing with a Congress controlled by the opposition party.</li>
<li>Barack Obama. For whatever it&rsquo;s worth, I like the idea that America could elect a non-WASP to be president. I like his notion of change, though again I&rsquo;m skeptical of just how much of it will translate from the stump to the office. I don&rsquo;t think for a second that he&rsquo;s the messianic non-politician that some want to make him out to be (can anything non-corrupt come out of Illinois politics?), but I think he&rsquo;s different than the Harry Reid-Nanci Pelosi school of Democrats we&rsquo;ve been afflicted with for lo these many years.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion: most of it&rsquo;s a wash. Obama takes it just based on health care, VP, and general &ldquo;change&rdquo;. So, that&rsquo;s my ramble. I&rsquo;m sure this will greatly please some friends and family and greatly shock others. Feel free to agree, disagree, argue, whatever. I&rsquo;m just hoping that next time around there&rsquo;s a candidate I&rsquo;m actually enthusiastic about voting for.</p>

<p>I wish you well. May your table be graced with lovely women and good men. May you drink well enough to drown the envy of youth in the satisfactions of maturity. May your men wear their weight with pride, secure in the knowledge that they have at last become considerable. May they rejoice that they will never again be taken for callow, black-haired boys. And your women? Ah! Women are like cheese strudels. When first baked, they are crisp and fresh on the outside, but the filling is unsettled and indigestible; in age, the crust may not be so lovely, but the filling comes at last into its own. May you relish them indeed. May we all sit long enough for reserve to give way to ribaldry and for gallantry to grow upon us. May there be singing at the table before the night is done, and old, broad jokes to fling at the stars and tell them we are men . . .

			 <p>I sent an email this morning which sent me thinking about a familiar quote, which in turn sent me thinking about one of my favorite sets of stories: the various adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a multitude of mysteries featuring the odd detective between 1887 and 1927, and Holmes has been studied, quoted, parodied, and dramatized ever since.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to the Homes stories by <a href="http://lrpresley.wordpress.com">Lydia</a> back in, oh, 1989 or so. (I was probably 12 years old.) After borrowing her volume (I&rsquo;m thinking it was <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> and <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>) and devouring it no time, I proceeded to borrow whatever I could from the library, and eventually bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Sherlock-Holmes-Vols-One/dp/0517481022%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0517481022">&ldquo;The Annotated Sherlock Holmes&rdquo;</a>, a ridiculously large book containing not only all the stories, but also illustrations, explanations of some of the period references, and, most amusingly, studies as to the &ldquo;actual&rdquo; dates of the mysteries, piecing these together from descriptions of cultural events, weather, and moon phases in the stories. This book was equal in size to my father&rsquo;s <em>Strong&rsquo;s</em> concordance, but I lugged it around anyway, reading in the car, reading while my brother Ryan took his piano lesson, reading pretty much anywhere I could get away with it. I was that sort of kid.</p>
<p>I recall distinctly driving my mom a bit batty with that annotated Holmes. One of the readings in my literature book somewhere in early high school (recall I was home-schooled) was a Holmes story, so, rather than read it from my lit book, I read it from the Annotated Holmes. Afterwards, Mom got out the discussion questions, and question number one was &ldquo;when did this adventure occur?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a straightforward question; after all, the story told the supposed month and year right in the first paragraph. But no, I wasn&rsquo;t going to pay attention to that. I quickly gave her the supposed &ldquo;actual&rdquo; date that the editor of the Annotated had surmised. She gave me a quite baffled look, and then, well, I had some explaining to do.</p>
<p>Holmes is one of those characters who, once you know, you start seeing references and allusions to all over the place. One such reference several years ago gave me the opportunity to email long-time <em>New York Times</em> columnist (and favorite of mine) William Safire to correct him. (In retrospect, I must have been one of dozens, if not hundreds, to do so.) He had quoted Holmes' line about &ldquo;the curious incident of the dog in the night-time&rdquo;, correctly attributed it to the story &ldquo;Silver Blaze&rdquo;, but then slipped up by saying that &ldquo;Silver Blaze&rdquo; was the name of the dog in the story. Oops. (Silver Blaze was a racehorse.) I got an automated reply email from the NYT, but was more excited to receive a two-line email response later that day which, by all appearances, was from the columnist himself.</p>
<p>I go back to Holmes every once and again to enjoy an old friend. The Annotated still occupies a rather large chunk of bookshelf in my basement, not too much the worse for wear after having been dragged around for nigh on twenty years of my life. Many years and many readings have not &ldquo;withered&rdquo; or &ldquo;staled&rdquo; the stories quite yet. I look forward to the day when I can pass on the adventures (and the giant volume) to one of my little readers at home.</p>
<p>[The title of this post is a quote from <em>The Adventure of the Empty House</em>, wherein Holmes slightly modifies the line from Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>.]</p>

This has long been a favorite time of year for me. I love watching baseball, or if a TV isn&rsquo;t available, listening to it on the radio. And today we get a trifecta, with the meat game of the baseball sandwich being the Chicago Cubs starting a home series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
<p>No sense in me adding to all the blather about the Cubs; just watching Sportscenter this morning they had features on &ldquo;The Curse&rdquo; (including the goat, the black cat, etc), the 100-year drought (there have been 4 states added to the USA since the Cubs last won the World Series!), etc, etc. As Lou Piniella said yesterday, the time for talk is done. Now it&rsquo;s time to play ball. I&rsquo;m too biased to make any good predictions here, but, as I told Richard on the phone this morning, I&rsquo;d love to see a Cubs/WhiteSox cross-town World Series&hellip; as long as the Cubs win it. :-)</p>

			 <p>I finished reading Richard Adams' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Watership-Down-Novel-Richard-Adams/dp/0743277708%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dscifirev-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0743277708">Watership Down</a></em> last night and, when adding it to my reading list, found it rather difficult to describe. Figuring that few of you ever look at my reading list, (which is fine,) and knowing that my attempt amused me, I thought I&rsquo;d post the description here, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a hard novel to describe, not because it&rsquo;s nondescript, but because short descriptions would leave out so much. It&rsquo;s a story about rabbits. Let&rsquo;s try this on for size: if Tolkien were to have written a story the length of one of the LotR books, and set it in modern day, and narrowed the scope from &ldquo;save the world&rdquo; to &ldquo;find a new place to live&rdquo; and written it about rabbits instead of hobbits, you might get something like Watership Down. I enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>Wow, <a href="/08/09/the-coffee-experiment-day-5/">it&rsquo;s been a week</a> since I&rsquo;ve posted an update on The Coffee Experiment. I think it&rsquo;s really time to stop calling it an experiment, and just call it a new normal part of my everyday life. I&rsquo;ve consistently been setting the timer to have the coffee brewed for me in the morning, and it&rsquo;s done a good job at keeping me going through the day. At the moment I&rsquo;m still working through the bag of Starbucks dark roast that&rsquo;s been in the freezer. I imagine it&rsquo;ll take me another few weeks to get through it. After that, I&rsquo;ll head down to <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">Brewed Awakenings</a> and decide what to try next.</p>
<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">Brewed Awakenings</a>, I hung out there for a while on Friday morning and tried a couple different drinks. First, Nate suggested a Don Correllejo, which is a double-shot espresso with Mexican chocolate added. Yummy. After that I had some of their daily light roast, which was also good, even drinking it black. I need a job where I can just spend mornings hanging out down at the coffeehouse. That would rock.</p>
<p>One funny thing I found out when visiting my folks this past weekend: it seems that my mother, a life-long coffee-disdainer, within a day or so of the start of my Coffee Experiment yet having not yet read about it on my blog, took up the coffee habit herself. Sounds like it&rsquo;s so far, so good for her as well. I think everybody in our family now drinks the stuff.</p>
<p>So, wow. I&rsquo;m now a coffee drinker. I feel so grown up.</p>

			 <p>After making the decision to leave <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi</a> at the end of the month, we find ourselves in an unfamiliar position: starting the church search. My church history is fairly short and doesn&rsquo;t include much searching: while growing up we attended a C&amp;MA church, a small Berean church, and then a <a href="http://www.gracebiblegranbury.com">small Bible church</a>. When I went to college I floated around for my first semester until Becky invited me to her <a href="http://www.longviewfbc.com">medium-sized Bible church</a>, which we then attended for the next 3.5 years. When we moved to Iowa, we were recommended to a church up here, and after about three weeks of visiting other churches decided to stick there where we had been recommended, at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>. We were at Noelridge for 8.5 years before leaving to plant Imago, and we were at Imago for the better part of a year. So my total church searching experience is a few months of aimless wandering in college and a few weeks after moving to Iowa. That ain&rsquo;t much.</p>
<p>Church searching has changed a lot since 9 years ago when we were looking around here in Cedar Rapids. Back then your main resources were the yellow pages and the religion section of the newspaper. Today, though, it&rsquo;s all about the websites. You can find out a lot about a church&rsquo;s beliefs and ministries with just a few clicks of the mouse. You can even listen to recent sermons. I think I&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to do <em>too much</em> pre-judging by the websites.</p>
<p>Several things I am anticipating will make this church search tough:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theological pickiness</strong>. I don&rsquo;t expect that I&rsquo;m gonna agree with <em>everything</em> at any church I attend, (heck, I didn&rsquo;t at Noelridge or Imago, either), but I&rsquo;d like it to be close. And I&rsquo;ll need to have the freedom at a church to hold some views that don&rsquo;t quite line up and not be ostracized for those. For example: <a href="http://www.cedarvalley.org">one of the churches we&rsquo;ve been considering</a> has a <a href="http://www.cedarvalley.org/doctrinalstatement/futuredoctrine.shtml">rather long excursis</a> in their doctrinal statement concerning the exact sequence of a premillenial end times. I&rsquo;m OK with them believing that, but I won&rsquo;t be able to handle it if they&rsquo;re dogmatic about it.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Expectations</strong>. Now, I have no desire to be in leadership again for a while. But I&rsquo;m going to want to have the pastor and elders of a church I attend be men who enjoy reading and discussing theological topics. I almost feel sorry for the pastor and/or elders who will have the typical so-you&rsquo;re-interested-in-our-church meeting with me. I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll have far more questions for them than they will have for me. Bonus points for anybody that&rsquo;s read any N. T. Wright. :-)</li>
<li><strong>Limited Choices</strong>. Now, while some of my friends will step in and suggest a bigger denominational change, I just can&rsquo;t see us moving to a more mainline denomination, even a conservative branch of one. We&rsquo;re not gonna end up Catholic, Lutheran, or Methodist, and we don&rsquo;t even have conservative Anglican or Presbyterian options in Cedar Rapids. Which pretty well leaves us Baptist, Bible, maybe E Free, and, well, not much else. Even in as big a town as Cedar Rapids. :-(</li>
<li><strong>The Struggle for Contentment</strong>. I am acknowledging here up front that we may not find someplace that I&rsquo;m completely happy with. And that will have to be OK. I would dearly love to have <a href="http://www.stevekmccoy.com">Steve McCoy&rsquo;s</a> church or <a href="http://www.joethorn.net">Joe Thorn</a>&rsquo;s church or <a href="http://www.raewhitlock.com">Rae Whitlock</a>&rsquo;s church nearby. I would totally go for an Acts29 church, and would take a very long hard look at one of the new breed of PCA churches. (We have <a href="http://www.hope-presbyterian.org/">one PCA church here</a> about 30 minutes away, and it appears to be the old, stodgy flavor of the PCA.) But given that those aren&rsquo;t available, we will have to be content with what we have available here. We&rsquo;re praying that God will be clear in His leading.</li>
</ul>
<p>We get a pass this weekend - we&rsquo;re leaving in a couple of hours to head to Wisconsin to visit my folks. But next weekend we&rsquo;ll have to bite the bullet, pick one of our options, and give it a try. I&rsquo;m planning on blogging our adventures, so check back. If you&rsquo;ve got any thoughts or suggestions, feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>

			 <p>After yesterday&rsquo;s run-in with completely nasty office coffee, I decided I would try brewing some better coffee up at home. While Jason and <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Daniel</a> both suggested a french press, I decided that I should first make sure this coffee thing is gonna stick before I make the investment. So I pulled our drop coffeemaker out of the basement (where it is stored awaiting visitors) and set it up to brew this morning.</p>
<p>We had coffee stored from the last time we&rsquo;ve had visitors, too, which isn&rsquo;t terrifically fresh, but at least has been stored in the freezer. It&rsquo;s a Starbucks dark roast. I set it all up last night and set the timer for 0500 this morning, which is ten minutes before my alarm goes off. I was wondering if I&rsquo;d smell the coffee all the way back in the bedroom. I didn&rsquo;t, though I think that is mostly because we have all the windows open and the ceiling fans on. I did, though, <em>hear</em> the thing start brewing just before my alarm went off to officially wake me up.</p>
<p>I poured a cup, splashed in a little milk, sat down with my breakfast cereal and the newspaper. It was really pretty good. Once this bag of coffee is used up I might want to try something a little lighter, but still&hellip; not bad at all, and far better than yesterday&rsquo;s office fare.</p>
<p>I had been thinking that I had an insulated cup that I could take along to the office with me, but I guess we must&rsquo;ve gotten rid of it some time ago. So, only one cup for me this morning. I&rsquo;ll find a mug today and be able to bring that second cup along to work tomorrow. I&rsquo;m starting to think this experiment might just be a success.</p>

			 <p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AO7cKK8nL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" alt="Blue Parakeet cover">When Zondervan offered up free early copies of Dr. Scot McKnight&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Parakeet-Rethinking-Read-Bible/dp/0310284880%3FSubscriptionId%3D02E5W5871AJF7PMMMS82%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0310284880">The Blue Parakeet</a></em> for bloggers to review, I knew I wanted to get in on the action. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed reading Scot&rsquo;s (he won&rsquo;t mind if I use his first name here, I think) <a href="http://www.jesuscreed.org">blog</a> for some time now, and while I knew he typically inhabits a spectrum of belief a little more emergent than I find myself, I looked forward to reading his thoughts on the Bible, or, as the subtitle of the book says, &ldquo;Rethinking How You Read the Bible&rdquo;. (Dr. McKnight is a professor of religious studies at North Park College in Chicago. He also wrote a volume on <em>Galatians</em> in the NIV Application Commentary series.)</p>
<p>Scot lays out his question in the first chapter: &ldquo;how, then, are we to live the Bible today?&rdquo; Sure, there are those folks who say that we follow all of it, but really, he says, we &ldquo;pick and choose&rdquo; what we live out. He knows that phrase will make us uncomfortable, but he does that to a purpose. We are so used to our denomination&rsquo;s (or our own) <em>interpretations</em> of Scripture, which help us know which parts we follow and which parts we don&rsquo;t, that we&rsquo;ve often stopped thinking about how we go about that interpretation in the first place.</p>
<p>McKnight asks us to look at the Bible and first understand the whole sweep of history - from creation to the fall to redemption to the end. Within that sweep, then, we can start to see how the individual pieces fit. Just as we shouldn&rsquo;t take a single verse out of context in a chapter, we shouldn&rsquo;t take a single chapter (or a single book!) out of context of the greater whole. He also encourages us to distinguish between God and the Bible. The Bible is one way God has chosen to reveal Himself to us, but the Bible isn&rsquo;t God. We don&rsquo;t worship the Bible. We worship God. (This whole distinction is a useful reminder for those of us who have been in churches where precise, &ldquo;literal&rdquo; adherence to the Scripture (at least, the passages deemed &ldquo;important&rdquo;) has been given overly-high priority.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed, appreciated, and agreed with the first two-thirds of <em>The Blue Parakeet</em>. Then Dr. McKnight, in a move he fully admits will not sit well with some, uses his principles of Biblical interpretation to argue for the acceptance of women in pastoral (teaching/leadership) roles in the church. And here is where I lose him. I know that this is one of his pet causes, but it just doesn&rsquo;t work for me, I&rsquo;m not convinced.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago on his blog, <a href="http://www.jesuscreed.org/?p=4267">Dr. McKnight talked about his interpretation of 1 Timothy 3</a> (a passage that doesn&rsquo;t get touched on in <em>The Blue Parakeet</em>), and argues it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, it is an <em>inference</em> to claim that only males can be elders or that all elders <em>must be males</em>. Why do I say this? Here’s why: Paul does not say “Elders must be males.” He <em>assumes</em> the elders to whom he writes are males, but he does not explicitly require that elders be males. Again: he assumes they are males, he says things that apply to males, <em>but Paul does not explicitly say that elders must be males</em>. [Emphasis in the original.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that just isn&rsquo;t a convincing argument to me. You have to assume and read just as much into the passage to come up with his interpretation as you do to come up with the traditional interpretation, and, with McKnight&rsquo;s position, you further have to ignore 2000 years of the church&rsquo;s historical understanding of the passage. Furthermore, he argues that the list of qualifications in 1 Tim 3 shouldn&rsquo;t be considered &ldquo;rules for&rdquo; or &ldquo;qualifications of&rdquo; elders - rather, that it should be considered &ldquo;symptoms of virtues expected of leaders for Christians in the 1st Century&rdquo;. And why? Because, first of all, the lists of 1 Tim 3 and Titus are different, and second, because &ldquo;we know that many pastors/elders/deacons have children who don’t believe and who are rebellious, some are quarrelsome, some are not hospitable, and not all have a good reputation with outsiders&rdquo;. In other words, because some who have held the role of elder in the church have failed to meet these standards, therefore they must not be &ldquo;standards&rdquo;. Begging your pardon, Dr. McKnight, but isn&rsquo;t that like saying that since people break the speed limit that the speed limit must just be a &ldquo;symptom of a virtue expected for drivers in the 21st century&rdquo;? But I digress.</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;d recommend Dr. McKnight&rsquo;s book for a good fresh look at how we interpret Scripture. The degree of &ldquo;groundbreakingness&rdquo; (surely that&rsquo;s not a word, is it?) you feel when reading it will, in large measure, depend on what Biblical tradition you have grown up in and/or studied. Be cautious, though, when you reach the portion that&rsquo;s interpretation; the quest for &ldquo;rethinking&rdquo; needs to continue to be guided by wisdom and historical perspective.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether to call this Day 4 or Day 6 of The Coffee Experiment. Do I count the weekend where I didn&rsquo;t drink coffee? I guess I&rsquo;ll be conservative and call this Day 4.</p>
<p>The office coffee, to this point, has been palatable. While being Folgers, which <a href="http://lapointemusic.blogspot.com/">Allie</a> assured me Saturday night isn&rsquo;t really coffee, it has been drinkable with a bit of powdered creamer added for good measure. This morning, though, is a different story. This morning the coffee is bitter and nasty. Glad I got some sleep last night because I&rsquo;m not gonna be getting any caffeine assistance this morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ddeboer/statuses/930319119">Daniel noted</a> that for this reason he takes his own coffee to work. While at the grocery store yesterday I was contemplating picking up some coffee to brew at home, but thought I might wait a few more days to see how The Experiment pans out. After this morning, I&rsquo;m thinking I might accelerate that purchase schedule a bit.</p>

			 <p>For 31 years I have professed to very much dislike coffee. If in need of caffeine to keep me going, I will resort to a diet pop of some sort, or, in extreme cases, Red Bull. However, my Diet Pepsi consumption levels have been high for the past month, and given the cost of Diet Pepsi and the knowledge that even diet pop has been shown to be not-so-good for you in studies, I figured it was time to give the coffee a shot. We&rsquo;ve got a communal coffee pot here in the office where Folgers is brewed for donations.</p>
<p>Yesterday was day one. I took my coffee black and it was not too bad. The caffeine did its job just fine, and I didn&rsquo;t find myself craving the Diet Pepsi for the buzz&hellip; only for the sweetness. I had brought a Diet Pepsi along and went ahead and drank it for lunch.</p>
<p>Today is day two. I started the morning with two cups of coffee, this time using some non-dairy creamer, which I found helped things out quite a bit. And today I haven&rsquo;t craved Diet Pepsi at all. Coffee also seems to fill me up less than the pop did; it feels more like I&rsquo;ve just drank lots of water.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d consider myself a total convert yet, but two days in I&rsquo;m appreciating the concept of drinking coffee. Next stop: brewing it for myself at home in the mornings. I&rsquo;ll wait a bit for that one and see if the habit takes.</p>

			 <p><em>Update: <a href="/08/10/rainsoft-of-ne-iowa-a-follow-up/">I received a response from Rainsoft of NE Iowa that very much helped to resolve the situation. Click here to read about it.</a></em></p>
<p>Last week while shopping at Home Depot, a nice lady struck up a conversation with us, and proceeded to ask if we&rsquo;d ever had our water tested before. Would we be interested? It&rsquo;d take about an hour, and Home Depot would give us a $20 gift card for our trouble.</p>
<p>Oh sure, we figured, we&rsquo;d not had our home water tested before. And yeah, we expected a sales pitch about some water treatment system, but whatever. And we can always use a $20 Home Depot card.</p>
<p>The night before our scheduled appointment we got a phone call from a call center confirming our appointment, making sure multiple times over that yes, both Becky and I were going to be home at that time, and then asking a series of questions that really didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with our home water solution. Becky answered as few as she could and then hung up the phone. We ended up having to call back to reschedule, and we ended up on the calendar then for 4 pm Monday.</p>
<p>At five minutes until 4 the lady we had met at Home Depot knocked on our door with her three briefcases of equipment. Guess we tried to cut it too close by giving the girls a bath, but hey, who ever shows up early for an appointment? So, we rushed the girls out of the tub and set them up with an hour-long TV show.</p>
<p>We sat down at the kitchen table and she told us briefly about her company, <a href="http://www.rainsoft.com/">RainSoft</a>. Then came the water testing. The kitchen sink didn&rsquo;t quite work to hook up her little mini-water-treater, so we all huddled in the bathroom as she ran a battery of tests. I knew she was getting verbose, but next thing I knew we were still running tests and it was 5:30. That&rsquo;s right, 90 minutes, and we weren&rsquo;t even close to getting the sales pitch. She did let us taste a bottle of their tasty drinking-water-treated water, though.</p>
<p>Finally the tests were nearing completion, so she set us down and worked us through her little notebook-driven pitch, warning of bad things like acid rain (didn&rsquo;t that get debunked at least a decade ago?), chlorine (&ldquo;many water systems have more than is safe for a swimming pool!&rdquo; oh, guess what, we don&rsquo;t have any in our water), and other nasty chemicals that can cause bad things. (Guess what: we don&rsquo;t have those, either.) Her sources were as reliable as Women&rsquo;s World magazine articles from the late 1980&rsquo;s can be. Eventually we found out that our water is very hard (which we already knew), but otherwise safe.</p>
<p>So then it was time for the sales pitch. It was as bad as a TV infomercial. Guess what? They normally charge $300 for installation. But they&rsquo;ll waive that today. Then the price of the unit is $4000. And, oh, by the way, you don&rsquo;t really need the drinking water filter, so how about a home air filtration system instead? Normally it&rsquo;s $2000, but how about today&rsquo;s special deal: it&rsquo;s only $1000! What a great deal! (I would&rsquo;ve really liked the air filtration system about the time she walked in the door - she must&rsquo;ve been smoking in her car all the way here. The dining room smelled of smoke for 30 minutes after she left!)</p>
<p>Then she &ldquo;ran the numbers&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s what a typical family spends on cleaning supplies. You won&rsquo;t need to spend that much at all because of your soft water. Oh, and we&rsquo;ll give you a long supply of soap so you won&rsquo;t need to buy any at all. Here, Chris, you run the calculator. Are you with me on these numbers? They make sense, right? Here, so see? You can get our deal for only $99/month. You&rsquo;ll actually be saving money! Don&rsquo;t believe us? We have this free coupon program we&rsquo;ll toss in free for 5 years, too! Just as a special gift!</p>
<p>It was nearly 7 pm when we had finally convinced her it didn&rsquo;t matter how rosy her numbers were, we weren&rsquo;t about to open up a $5000 line of credit to buy the thing tonight. She sullenly packed her bags and audaciously asked for the names and phone numbers of 5 homeowning friends who she might be able to contact. &ldquo;As a favor to&rdquo; her, she said. She&rsquo;d get a gas voucher if we gave her names. We declined.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re our salesman reading this, here are some helpful tips for how to make a sale to this cynical engineer next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be on time and don&rsquo;t go past the time you said you&rsquo;d take. I have three hours between the time I get home from work and when my kids go to bed. Don&rsquo;t take all of them. Did you ever wonder when we were going to eat supper?</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make us feel like we&rsquo;re doing you a favor by listening to your pitch. We don&rsquo;t owe you anything.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use the old bait-and-switch. Sure, the nifty specially-filtered bottled water tastes good. But then you didn&rsquo;t recommend it for us. And you didn&rsquo;t let us taste the normally-filtered water. Tsk tsk.</li>
<li>Be up-front about the costs, including the financing. I&rsquo;m a pretty sharp guy, I know how the numbers work. You preach $99/month up front, but when I ask &ldquo;for how many months?&rdquo;, you finally admit that it&rsquo;s just a $99/month minimum payment on a line of credit that charges 17.99% interest. That&rsquo;s 8 years at $99/month. Ouch.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to rush me into a sale. Seriously, you&rsquo;re asking me to make a snap decision, without doing any other research, on a $5000 system? In 10 minutes while you&rsquo;re here staring at me? If it&rsquo;s a good value today, it&rsquo;ll be just as good a value tomorrow. If not, you&rsquo;re trying to pull one over on me. For shame.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to talk circles around my wife. Yeah, she was struggling trying to verbalize her objections to the deal. But making her feel stupid because she doesn&rsquo;t see it your way? Bad form. A little hint: if I have to choose between my wife and you, she&rsquo;s gonna win every time and twice on Sundays. Be glad it wasn&rsquo;t a Sunday.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re really trying to sell a product, leave some literature behind in case I change my mind. You didn&rsquo;t even leave as much as a business card tonight. That gave me the idea that you were only in it for the quick sale tonight, and not interested in the long-term cultivation of a customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what have I learned? Maybe I should&rsquo;ve just turned down the test in the first place. But really, is there some unspoken social contract that obliges me to purchase the product because I invited the salesperson into my home to make their pitch? I didn&rsquo;t think so. In the future I&rsquo;ll stick to doing my research on the internet and proactively contacting vendors when I want to make a purchase, thank you very much.</p>

			 <p>Tonight after the service at <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi</a>, I read this brief letter to the congregation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been a blessing to be at Imago Christi this year, to serve as an elder and as worship leader, and to help plan and organize a church in its very first days of existence. It is therefore with sadness tonight that I come to tell you that my family and I will be leaving Imago Christi Church as of the end of this month.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Why are we leaving? Like any decision, there are a multitude of reasons each having a small part in the big decision. Primarily, though, it comes down to personal and family needs, and the conviction that I need to reprioritize my life with family in mind first. Some have already asked &ldquo;well, can&rsquo;t you stay at Imago and just reduce your responsibilities?&rdquo; and believe me, we have wrestled long and hard with that question. I have had something of a pattern of this my past several years in ministry - needing to recalibrate, trying to reduce, finding it impossible to effect permanent change. It is that history, as much as anything, that has convinced me (and Becky, too) that bigger change is necessary.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In case I haven&rsquo;t been clear about it already, this isn&rsquo;t a case of anyone being forced to leave or asked to leave or pushed out - quite the opposite, I have been pleaded with at length to stay. We are still very much behind the mission of Imago Christi, and our prayers go with you. I know that some of you do not or will not understand quite why we made this decision. And that&rsquo;s OK. If you have questions feel free to talk to me afterwards. But please know that we have prayed much about this, and really feel like we are following God&rsquo;s leading here. So we go. And so we trust, and pray that you will, too, that God is at work in this, both for our family, and for Imago Christi as a church body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been a very difficult decision for us over the past couple of months. In the end, though, we feel like this is where God is leading us - to make a break and try and re-form things in a way that works better for our family. We don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;ll end up for church, but we&rsquo;ll be looking around. That&rsquo;ll feel weird after nearly 10 years with mostly the same folks at Noelridge and Imago.</p>
<p>One day at a time.</p>

			 <p>Over the past two weeks' political conventions I have watched most of the major speeches and then headed to my computer to check Twitter, the blogs, news sites, and online forum that I frequent. What has astonished me these past two weeks is the amount of bitter, vitriolic tone that has come not from the politicians (where I expect it) but from supporters of both sides.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not talking about people complaining bitterly about the other side misrepresenting their candidate&rsquo;s positions (which both sides do). I&rsquo;m not talking about people finding creative ways to describe their opponents' apparent inexperience or lack of qualifications. (Both sides do it, and <a href="/08/09/how-much-experience-have-presidential-and-vp-candidates-had/">both have their share of inexperience</a>.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not talking about people you&rsquo;d expect the worst from, people like Hannity and Limbaugh on the right and The Huffington Post and The Daily Kos on the left. I&rsquo;ve done my best to tune all of them out for a while now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about Christians. People who I know are good, kind people. The kind of people you&rsquo;d want to sit down and have a beer with and discuss life. The kind of people who you&rsquo;d want serving in your church, ministering to you or your friend in need, teaching your kids in Sunday School. And these last two weeks the things I&rsquo;ve heard and read from these folks have surprised me. Name-calling. Making fun of candidates for their &ldquo;creepy laugh&rdquo; or their funny accent or the way they dress. Things that they wouldn&rsquo;t ever in a million years think of saying about a friend&hellip; or a visitor to their church&hellip; or someone they met on the street. But because that person is the current representative of a political view that they disagree with or fear, there seems to be no limit to the insults that can be hurled.</p>
<p>Professor and author Gene Veith today on his blog asks <a href="http://www.geneveith.com/why-the-vitriol/">&ldquo;Why the vitriol?&quot;</a> He asks, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve discussed controversial theological points and complex moral issues on this blog and stayed friendly. Why do we lose it when it comes to politics? There may be good reasons, but I’d like us to think about what they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With due respect, Professor, I&rsquo;m not so sure about good reasons. In fact, I want to go a little further and say this:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>If it would be wrong to make fun of your co-worker&rsquo;s funny-sounding name, it&rsquo;s wrong to make similar fun of Barack Obama.</p>
<p>If it would be wrong to derisively mock your neighbor&rsquo;s creepy laugh, it&rsquo;s wrong to mock John McCain&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>If it would be sinfully unloving to deride the parent of an unwed teenage mother who visited your church last week, it&rsquo;s just as sinful and unloving to deride Sarah Palin&rsquo;s current circumstance.</p>
<p>Why do we think that because there&rsquo;s a presidential election on that we&rsquo;re suddenly exempt from 1 Peter 3?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble. Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. For,<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech. He must turn from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not calling for the end of all political debate. I&rsquo;m not saying that Christians shouldn&rsquo;t have strong political views, or endorse candidates, or argue the issues.</p>
<p>But we should keep it to the issues. There are plenty to discuss and argue. If we listen instead of bluster, we might just learn something from the other guy, too.</p>
<p>So, friends, we shouldn&rsquo;t be mocking John McCain because he has a weird smile and laugh. We shouldn&rsquo;t be making fun of Barack Obama because he has (compared to recent political candidates) a strange-sounding name. We shouldn&rsquo;t be deriding Sarah Palin because she sounds like an extra from <em>Fargo</em>. And all that jesting about Joe Biden&rsquo;s hair plants? At least do it in good cheer.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A warning to my casual readers: this post is going to get more than a wee bit nerdy, and probably a bit political, too.</p>
<p>OK, with that out of the way, let me note that one of the things that&rsquo;s been bugging me ever since John McCain&rsquo;s announcement of Sarah Palin as his VP choice last week is that while there&rsquo;s been a veritable chorus describing her as &ldquo;inexperienced&rdquo; and &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo;, no one has really bothered to set down what they thought a VP&rsquo;s experience should be. I <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/index.php/topic,64365.0.html">had this discussion</a> with a guy who is a big Obama supporter over on a forum I frequent, and even he was unwilling to suggest a criteria other than that it should be &ldquo;the same as if they were running for president&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to give myself a history lesson. How much experience, exactly, did our various candidates for president and vice president have? <a href="http://twitter.com/gfmorris/statuses/908037653">Geof suggested</a> plotting that data against their presidential ratings to see how it panned out. So I did that, too. To bound the problem a little bit, I decided to limit my study to the more modern presidential era (starting with 1960). Then I headed off to Wikipedia to do some data collection.</p>
<p><strong>The Setup</strong></p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s experience is, in some ways, difficult to quantify, but I settled on the following categories of experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Years of college education (I also tracked whether it was Ivy League and whether they got a law degree)</li>
<li>Years of military service</li>
<li>Years in a state legislature</li>
<li>Years as a state governor</li>
<li>Years in other federal government service (i.e. cabinet or civil service positions)</li>
<li>Years in Congress</li>
<li>Years as Vice President</li>
<li>Years as President</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky part, then, is how you choose to sum these up; let&rsquo;s just agree that, for instance, years served as Vice President or as a governor are more valuable, year-for-year, than those served in the military or in a state legislature. I settled on some multipliers to try to help even things out. Feel free to argue over these if you want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Years of college education (I also tracked whether it was Ivy League and whether they got a law degree) - <strong>0.25</strong></li>
<li>Years of military service - <strong>0.25</strong></li>
<li>Years in a state legislature - <strong>0.25</strong></li>
<li>Years as a state governor - <strong>1.0</strong></li>
<li>Years in other federal government service (i.e. cabinet or civil service positions) - <strong>0.5</strong></li>
<li>Years in Congress - <strong>0.75</strong></li>
<li>Years as Vice President - <strong>1.0</strong></li>
<li>Years as President - <strong>2.0</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, George H. W. Bush, in 1984, had 4 years of college, 4 years in the military, 5 years in government service, 4 years in congress, and 4 years as VP. That gives him a score of ((4*0.25)+(4*0.25)+(5*0.5)+(4*0.75)+(4*1.0)) = 11.50.</p>
<p>With those multipliers in place it was easy enough to get Excel to do some sums and give me some totals.</p>
<p>What I found was fairly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>The Data</strong></p>
<p><strong>The average experience score for a presidential candidate:</strong> 16.8. <strong>The average experience score for a VP candidate:</strong> 12.9. <strong>Highest score for a presidential candidate:</strong> 28.75, shared by Bob Dole in 1996 and Gerald Ford in 1976. <strong>Highest score for a VP candidate:</strong> also 28.75, Joe Biden this year.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest score for a presidential candidate:</strong> 5.25, Barack Obama, this year. (second lowest: George W. Bush&rsquo;s 7.50 in 2000.) <strong>Lowest score for a VP candidate:</strong> 3.00, Sarah Palin, this year. (second lowest: Spiro Agnew&rsquo;s 3.75 in 1968.)</p>
<p><strong>Highest POTUS/VP combined score:</strong> Dole/Kemp in 1996 (45.75) <strong>Lowest POTUS/VP combined score:</strong> Reagan/Bush in 1980 (17.25)</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a lot of data, how about some analysis?</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>I did a plot of the experience ratings against some presidential performance ratings (as <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2008/Info/experience.html">found here</a>, which claim to be amalgamated from several different ratings on Wikipedia), but found that to be a mixed bag. There were experienced presidents who ranked poorly (Nixon) and well (LBJ) and inexperienced presidents similarly (Reagan ranked high, Jimmy Carter much lower). <strong>Result:</strong> Inconclusive.</p>
<p>Next, I noticed an interesting trend. If you throw out the few elections where strong incumbents were running for second terms (LBJ in 1964 after finishing JFK&rsquo;s term, Nixon in 1972, Reagan in 1984), <em>in each of the other cases, the POTUS/VP pair with the lower experience score won the election.</em> <strong>Result:</strong> If that trend holds through this election, McCain/Palin will win.</p>
<p>If you want to do a little more hardcore statistical analysis,</p>
<p><strong>POTUS Standard Deviation:</strong> 6.59 <strong>VP Standard Deviation:</strong> 5.82</p>
<p>Just for sake of argument, this means that Obama&rsquo;s POTUS score (5.25) is 1.75 standard deviations below the mean, and that Palin&rsquo;s VP score (3.00) is 1.70 standard deviations below the mean&hellip; which means that, per these ratings, Obama is slightly more relatively inexperienced as a presidential candidate than Palin is as a VP candidate. (Only slightly, though.)</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is great data for us dataheads who like to ponder such things. What it really shows, I think, is that there are far more factors that play into the election (and the subsequent job performance) than just experience.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll also conclude that I still haven&rsquo;t answered the question regarding &ldquo;how much experience is enough?&rdquo;. Yes, Palin is the least-experienced VP candidate in the past 50 years. But Obama is also the least-experienced POTUS candidate. Hey, the nature of number is that <em>somebody</em> will have to be least-experienced. So until somebody can give me some quantifiable other measures, I think it&rsquo;s still gonna come down to gut feel and politics&hellip; like usual.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/08/28/book-review-wild.html">Book Review: Wild Goose Chase</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/08/28/book-review-wild.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-08-28 06:29:43 -0500">Aug 28, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>Wild Goose Chase</em>, the latest book by pastor Mark Batterson of National Community Church in Washington, DC, sets out its' premise in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Celtic Christians had a name for the Holy Spirit that has always intrigued me. They called Him <em>An Geadh-Glas</em>, or &ldquo;the Wild Goose&rdquo;. I love the imagery and implications. The name hints at the mysterious nature of the Holy Spirit. Much like a gild goose, the Spirit of God cannot be tracked or tamed. An element of danger and an air of unpredictability surround Him. And while the name may sound a little sacrilegious at first earshot, I cannot think of a better description of what it&rsquo;s like to pursue the Spirit&rsquo;s leading through life than <em>Wild Goose chase</em>. I think the Celtic Christians were on to something that institutionalized Christianity has missed out on&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With each chapter in the book, Batterson then calls the reader to &ldquo;come out of the cage&rdquo; of one encumbrance or another, sharing anecdotes from his own life and those he&rsquo;s come into contact with in his ministry, and then finishing up each chapter with an example of the principle that he sees in the life of a biblical character.</p>
<p>I was unimpressed when the introduction, and indeed, the whole premise of the book, seemed to be based less on some Scriptural principle than on a single phrase from Christian antiquity. And my concerns were deepened when I looked at the chapter titles and subheadings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goose Bumps: Coming Out of the Cage of Responsibility</li>
<li>Dictatorship Of The Ordinary: Coming Out of the Cage of Routine</li>
<li>Eight-Foot Ceilings: Coming Out of the Cage of Assumptions</li>
<li>A Rooster&rsquo;s Crow: Coming Out of the Cage of Guilt</li>
<li>Sometimes it Takes A Shipwreck: Coming Out of the Cage of Failure</li>
<li>Good Old-Fashioned Guts: Coming Out of the Cage of Fear</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are some good points to be made in the book from time to time, it really feels to me that Batterson wrote the self-help, motivational principles of <em>Wild Goose Chase</em> and then looked to find bits and pieces of Scripture to support his points&hellip; which is a dangerous way to teach the Bible. In addition, Batterson&rsquo;s style of writing is unimaginative, cliché-ridden, trying too hard to be cool and trendy. Color me unimpressed.</p>
<p>After finishing up <em>Wild Goose Chase</em>, I felt like I had just sat through one of those exercise infomercials where ridiculously-toned models and cheesy announcers hype their transform-your-life product <em>ad nauseam</em> for 30 minutes late at night. What I came away longing for was something more solid, stable, and reliable - something more analogous to a Ken Burns documentary on PBS. So I&rsquo;m sorry, Multnomah, I just can&rsquo;t recommend this book. My friends, if you&rsquo;re going to buy a book on living the Christian life, get something by Eugene Peterson instead. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>
<p><em>As requested, I&rsquo;ll link to Amazon: you can buy</em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590527194">Wild Goose Chase</a> <em>there. But I&rsquo;d suggest you pick up something else instead.</em></p>

			 <p>OK, so bad travel plans notwithstanding, I made it to Denver on-time on Monday evening. Tuesday was spent in an all-day FAA DER Recurrent General Training class (boring), and today and Thursday I&rsquo;m attending the National Software and Airborne Electronic Hardware Conference. It&rsquo;s sponsored by the FAA and NASA Langley Research Center, and there are some really interesting topics if you&rsquo;re into safety-critical airborne software. Which, I know, none of you reading this are. :-) So enough about the conference.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t really seen much of Denver yet, though I may atone for that this evening and travel about. I&rsquo;ve just got too many things on my to-do list for this week. Sermon prep for Saturday, new Conversation Cafe website (now branded <a href="http://www.topicsonfirst.org">Topics On First</a> - check it out! - but it&rsquo;s still the beta version of the site), planning orders of service for the fall, updating church bylaws and membership covenants&hellip; so much to do, so little time.</p>
<p>Denver is a little bit frustrating, location-wise, because you think you&rsquo;re in Colorado, there should be mountains&hellip; but there aren&rsquo;t really any mountains in Denver. You can see them off in the distance, but they&rsquo;re still too far away to get to without some more serious time driving than I&rsquo;ll have. Oh well. Maybe one of these summers we can hit them for a vacation again.</p>
<p>Well, lunch hour is almost over so it&rsquo;s time to head back to the conference. Good times.</p>

			 <p>Work necessitates that tomorrow I travel from Cedar Rapids to Denver to attend three days of FAA training. On the face of it, that doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad, travel-wise. CID -&gt; DEN is only a two-hour flight, and one US airline, when not eternally funding the estate of George Gershwin with its advertising budget, provides three daily non-stop flights from our fair city to the Mile-High.</p>
<p>But wait! This is no ordinary travel planning. This is corporate travel! Per the guidelines of our corporate travel policy (its wisdom, who can measure?) I have been routed on a different airline from Cedar Rapids first to Dallas-Fort Worth, and only <em>then</em> to Denver. For those scoring along at home, that&rsquo;s 850 miles and two hours south-by-southwest to DFW, a 90-minute layover, then another 800 miles and two hours northwest from DFW to DEN. Which is quite obviously far superior to the 700 miles and two hours directly west from CID to DEN. To ice the proverbial cake, the forecast for both CID and DEN tomorrow calls for nothing but sunshine. DFW? 80% probability of thunderstorms.</p>
<p><a href="/06/06/atlanta-impressions/">Two years ago</a> when I attended this training travel was a mess and I ended up driving through downtown Atlanta at midnight searching for my hotel; <a href="/07/07/new-orleans-faa-sw-der-conference/">last year DFW gave me delays heading to New Orleans</a> and I was trying to avoid the bayou and find my hotel after even The Big Easy had fallen asleep. Even with this year&rsquo;s circuitous routing I am scheduled to arrive in Denver before 7 pm MDT, so it will take some serious delays if I am to achieve the three-peat. Still, with travel plans like this, anything is possible.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/08/14/finding-the-right.html">Finding the right Saturday-night service time</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of our challenges at Imago has been figuring out the right time to hold our Saturday night service. Pick a time to early, and folks find it hard to attend because they&rsquo;re still wanting to finish their Saturday activities. (Especially during the summer.) Pick a time too late, and you&rsquo;re running in to evening plans (which is bad if you&rsquo;re trying to attract college students), dinner schedules, and small children&rsquo;s bedtimes.</p>
<p>When we started back in January we decided on holding the services from 5:30 - 6:30pm. The reasoning went something like this: it&rsquo;s early enough that people can eat afterwards, even go out to dinner with someone else from church after the service. It&rsquo;s early enough that people with small children won&rsquo;t run into trouble with bedtimes. It&rsquo;s late enough that people should be able to make it and still have been able to put in a good day of work on Saturday. And really, for the past 7 months, that&rsquo;s worked pretty well. For our volunteers, it means something more like a 4:30 - 7:00 commitment, but that&rsquo;s still not awful.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re approaching fall and we want to add a couple of adult Bible studies on Saturday nights. We&rsquo;ve tossed around all sorts of service times, from starting earlier (5:00?) with classes afterwards, to having classes first, then the service, to moving everything later&hellip; Even though we&rsquo;re talking about at most a two-and-a-half hour block of time, for some reason it seems a lot more difficult to fit it in on a Saturday night than it would be on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Tonight at our core team meeting the elders are going to propose the following schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>5:00 - 5:15 prayer for the service</li>
<li>5:30 - 6:30 worship service</li>
<li>6:30 - 7:00 fellowship and snacks</li>
<li>7:00 - 7:50 adult Bible classes</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s probably the best option we&rsquo;ve got right now. The other challenge is what to do with the kids during the class time given that we&rsquo;re struggling with having enough manpower to do kids ministries. But we&rsquo;ve got to do that somehow, to make the opportunity available. We&rsquo;re trusting that God will provide the workers to teach the kids He brings in.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/08/12/wrestling-with-ideas.html">Wrestling with ideas about church membership</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of the things we&rsquo;ve been wrestling with as elders at Imago is the concept of church membership. Now, we all agree that membership is important, both for accountability for folks who are a part of the fellowship, and to provide accountability for the church leadership. But most of us come from Baptist churches where &ldquo;membership&rdquo; is too often considered a ticket to gripe and cause trouble at business meetings.</p>
<p>Our objectives for &ldquo;membership&rdquo; and the &ldquo;membership process&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide a way for people to feel like they are a part of the congregation</li>
<li>Provide a process whereby people can understand Imago&rsquo;s distinctives, including doctrinal statement and leadership structure</li>
<li>Create an environment where people come to think of &ldquo;membership&rdquo; as having responsibilities and commitments rather than &ldquo;privileges&rdquo;</li>
<li>Keep the voting base limited to the core planning/leadership team, rather than the standard Baptist congregational democracy.</li>
<li>Oh, yeah, and the end result needs to be church members, committed to service and under the authority of the church.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have pretty well settled on a set of three &ldquo;covenants&rdquo; that might be looked at as &ldquo;tiers&rdquo; of membership, though we&rsquo;re trying hard not to call them that.</p>
<p><strong>Fellowship Covenant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is pretty basic. This allows people who want to feel like they&rsquo;re a part of a fellowship to say that yeah, they&rsquo;re a part of the fellowship. I have really wrestled with whether or not this covenant should include a statement of accountability to the church. I am thinking maybe it should.</p>
<p><strong>Ministry Covenant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.</li>
<li>I will support the church with its financial needs as the Lord so directs me.</li>
<li>I will use my spiritual gifts in ministry opportunities of the church.</li>
<li>I will become better acquainted with ministry opportunities and strategies by attending planning and evaluation meetings of the church. I understand that I am able to contribute to the discussion at these meetings, but do not have the right to vote.</li>
<li>I will submit myself by being accountable to the leadership of Imago Christi Church.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the commitment at this level would require completion of a membership class, which would include a review of the doctrinal statement. At this level we wouldn&rsquo;t require that the person agree with the doctrinal statement 100%, but we&rsquo;d ask them to identify any differences they have and discuss them with the elders.</p>
<p>People committed at this level would be able to assume responsibilities such as teaching children, assisting in (but not leading) ministries, and would be welcome to participate in business and planning meetings of the church, but would not have a vote.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Covenant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will support the ministry of Imago Christi Church with my regular attendance at worship services and other events sponsored by the church.</li>
<li>I will support the church with its financial needs as the Lord so directs me.</li>
<li>I will use my spiritual gifts in ministry opportunities of the church.</li>
<li>I will attend and participate in the discussion at planning and evaluation meetings of the church and have the right to vote on any church business as prescribed by the church bylaws.</li>
<li>I will submit myself by being accountable to the leadership of Imago Christi Church.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this level, we would require that folks agree with our doctrinal statement, have been baptized by immersion, and have completed the membership class. This level would also require the approval of the elders.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still not sure when we&rsquo;ll institute this process - I&rsquo;m guessing probably in January. A year is plenty long for us to run with no members.</p>

			 <p>A week without a blog update + lack of creativity = desperate measures. Hence, the bullet points.</p>
<ul>
<li>This past weekend felt far more like autumn than summer; this morning when I woke up it was 53°F outside and 63°F in the house. Beautiful sleeping weather. It&rsquo;s gonna warm up a bit this week, but nothing too bad.</li>
<li>I <em>thought</em> it felt like I ran into a strand of web as I walked into the dining room this morning. A few minutes later I felt something on my neck. Becky, you can thank me later for killing that spider. :-)</li>
<li>My sermon on Saturday night went pretty well. I intended to link to it here but didn&rsquo;t get it uploaded last night. It&rsquo;ll have to wait.</li>
<li>Now I need to get my backside in gear for my next sermon, only two weeks hence. How do I focus all I want to say about worship into 30 minutes?</li>
<li>Next week I&rsquo;m headed to Denver for some training and a conference. I think it&rsquo;ll probably be warmer in Denver than it will be at home while I&rsquo;m gone.</li>
<li>Nick &amp; Allie led worship Saturday night at Imago and did a fantastic job. Allie wrote a new tune for the hymn <em>Under His Wings</em> that has been stuck in my head all weekend. Thanks a lot, Allie. ;-)</li>
<li>My poor backyard is being overtaken by crabgrass. Gotta do something about that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, now, that was random, eh?</p>

			 <p>This week&rsquo;s book review, thanks to a free copy from WaterBrook Press, is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Choice-Move-Beyond-Betrayal/dp/1400074258/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217010140&amp;sr=1-1">The Healing Choice</a></em> and its associated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Choice-Guidebook-Beyond-Betrayal/dp/1400074266/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217010192&amp;sr=1-3">Guidebook</a>, written by Brenda Stoeker and Susan Allen. The authors are aiming here to help women heal from the betrayal of a husband&rsquo;s unfaithfulness. Given the subject matter and the target audience, Becky volunteered to read the books and give us a review.</p>
<p>Becky says:</p>
<p>In what might well be a surprise to the reader, the first half of <em>The Healing Choice</em> centers not around an unfaithful husband, but around the death of author Brenda&rsquo;s mother. She then goes on to draw parallels between her feelings of being betrayed by God and the feelings of being betrayed by her unfaithful husband. The second half of the book then tells the story of Susan&rsquo;s healing after her husband&rsquo;s unfaithfulness. Her experiences led her to start <a href="http://www.avenueresource.com">Avenue</a>, a ministry facilitating support groups for men and women dealing with these situations. Both the stories are good and seem like they&rsquo;d be helpful to someone in those situations, but it was something of a surprise to open up a book with a cover selling it as being about marital unfaithfulness and find the first half dealing, rather, with the death of a parent.</p>
<p>I opened up the guidebook expecting more of a study guide, something that might be used in a group study or personal study. However, the guidebook was less of the workbook-style book I was expecting and more of what I would&rsquo;ve expected to be in the actual book. There is a lot of good content in the guidebook - it would work well as a stand-alone book, too. Expectations aside, these would seem to be good books for someone in the process of putting a marriage back together.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Thanks, Becky!</p>

			 <p>After the beach we took a couple of days to travel up from Long Beach to Leavenworth. The stop in Yakima wasn&rsquo;t really anything to write home about - Yakima is quite different from the other places in Washington we visited - dry, dusty, more desert than anything. But it was a good stopping-off point. Becky shot pictures from the moving van like a wild woman. She did get a rather nice one of Mount Rainier:</p>

<p>Also, on our way up to Leavenworth, the girls had fun throwing rocks into this little mountain stream:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/2670641754/" title="DSC_6912 by chrishubbs, on Flickr"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/bfb6591c27.jpg" alt="DSC_6912"></a></p>
<p>Once we made it to Leavenworth, we had a great time with family and friends at the wedding. We stayed at the <a href="http://www.riverdanceleavenworth.com">Riverdance Lodge</a>, which you really must check out via their website to appreciate. It&rsquo;s a ridiculously posh vacation home which happens to be right next door to the house that Andrew &amp; Heather were borrowing for the wedding. So, our family rented it to stay for a couple days. Fantastic choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157606175171898/">whole set of photos on Flickr</a> from the rehearsal and before and after the wedding, and it&rsquo;s really hard to decide which ones to show here, so I&rsquo;ll just give you one of them and you can go visit the set. In this particular pic, Andrew and Heather were kinda bored during the photo shoot and gave me this little pose:</p>

<p>Such fun. There&rsquo;s one more I&rsquo;d post, but somehow I didn&rsquo;t get it uploaded to Flickr yet. I&rsquo;ll make a separate post for that one picture - how often can you say you have a guy relieving himself against a tree in the background of a wedding picture? :-)</p>
<p>The wedding was beautiful and went about as smoothly as any wedding I&rsquo;ve ever been to. I played the piano, Ryan sang, Laura and Addie were beautiful flower girls. They also had a lot of fun dancing afterwards. What a fantastic time of celebration.</p>

			 <p>This weekend I finished up reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385524064?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385524064">Rules of Deception</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scifirev-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385524064" alt="">, the latest novel by <a href="http://www.christopherreich.com">Christopher Reich</a>. I have read all of Reich&rsquo;s novels and quite enjoy them; he does the spy/crime/legal thriller genre as well as most anybody out there right now. I had one real disappointment with the book, though (and OK, this is a bit of a spoiler, so be forewarned): the true evil villain, the mastermind who is willing to kill hundreds of people to accomplish his nefarious goals, is a &ldquo;born-again&rdquo;, &ldquo;evangelical Christian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now, I realize Dan Brown made it cool to rip on Christians and the church with <em>The DaVinci Code</em>, indeed, it seems nearly <em>de rigueur</em> these days to have Christians as the bad guys. And certainly as an author Mr. Reich is allowed to make whatever plot choices he wants to. He&rsquo;s very even-handed with his other groups of people - there are good and bad CIA agents, good and bad Iranians, good and bad Americans, and etc, in his plot. But Christians? They&rsquo;re <em>all</em> bad. And shadowy. And in lock-step. And willing to do anything, kill anyone, incite nuclear war, all for the purpose of &ldquo;hastening the Rapture&rdquo;. Ugh.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it, this is one of the reasons that Tom Clancy, one of the better authors in this genre a decade ago, had such good stories: he was willing to use the real-life bad-guys of the day and didn&rsquo;t feel any politically-correct need to pick somebody else. Hence, during the Cold War, the Soviets were the bad guys, even though there were some good Soviets among them (<em>The Hunt for Red October</em>, <em>The Cardinal of the Kremlin</em>). Once the Wall fell and the new fear was Islamic Fundamentalism, Clancy went with it. In <em>The Sum of All Fears</em> there are good Muslims and bad Muslims, good Jews and bad Jews, heck, good Americans and bad Americans. But Clancy never felt the need to invent some other bad guys just to be politically correct.</p>
<p>So I enjoyed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385524064?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scifirev-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385524064">Rules of Deception</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scifirev-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0385524064" alt="">, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll read Mr. Reich&rsquo;s next book when it comes out. But I can&rsquo;t help but wish that he&rsquo;d take a more realistic look at the world when he does. Maybe a little more plot creativity next time?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/07/16/c-s-lewis.html">C. S. Lewis on Consistency in the Worship Service</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/07/16/c-s-lewis.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-07-16 19:51:57 -0500">Jul 16, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Pastor Richard gave me this wonderful (if a bit long) quote from C. S. Lewis regarding consistency in the worship service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think our business as laymen is to take what we are given and make the best of it. And I think we should find this a great deal easier if what we were given was always and everywhere the same.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To judge from their practice, very few Anglican clergymen take this view. It looks as if they believed people can be lured to go to church be incessant brightenings, lightenings, lengthenings, abridgements, simplifications, and complications of the service. And it is probably true that a new, keen vicar will usually be able to form within his parish a minority who are in favour of his innovations. The majority, I believe, never are. Those who remain - many give up churchgoing altogether - merely endure.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Is this simply because the majority are hide-bound? I think not. They have a good reason for their conservatism. Novelty, simply as such, can have only an entertainment value. And they don&rsquo;t go to church to be entertained. They go to use the service, or, if you prefer, to enact it. Every service is a structure of acts and words through which we receive a sacrament, or repent, or supplicate, or adore. And it enables us to do these things best - if you like, it &ldquo;works&rdquo; best - when, through long familiarity, we don&rsquo;t have to think about it. As long as you notice, and have to count, the steps, you are not yet dancing but only learning to dance. A good shoe is a shoe you don&rsquo;t notice&hellip; The perfect church service would be one we were almost unaware of; our attention would have been on God.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But every novelty prevents this. It fixes our attention on the service itself; and thinking about worship is a different thing from worshiping. The important question about the Grail was &ldquo;for what does it serve?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tis mad idolatry that makes the service greater than the God.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
A still worse thing may happen. Novelty may fix our attention not even on the service but on the celebrant. You know what I mean. Try as one may to exclude it, the question &ldquo;What on earth is he up to now?&rdquo; will intrude. It lays one&rsquo;s devotion waste. There is really some excuse for the man who said, &ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d remember that the charge to Peter was Feed my sheep; not Try experiments on my rats, or even, Teach my performing dogs new tricks.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Thys my whole liturgiological position really boils down to an entreaty for permanence and uniformity. I can make do with almost any kind of service whatever, if only it will stay put. But if each form is snatched away just when I am beginning to feel at home in it, then I can never make any progress in the art of worship.<br>

			 <p>After <a href="/08/07/in-seattle/">arriving late on Monday</a> and <a href="/08/07/the-flat-tire/">having vehicle difficulty</a>, we took the new minivan out to the Washington coast to spend a couple of days at the beach. We encountered several of these signs along the way&hellip; not something we typically see back home in Iowa.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/2666221785/" title="DSC_6670 by chrishubbs, on Flickr"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/2355c1123a.jpg" alt="DSC_6670"></a></p>
<p>The three-hour drive to the appropriately-named Long Beach brought us from temperatures in the upper 70&rsquo;s in the Seattle area to 60 degrees, fog, and 30 mph winds in Long Beach. Yowza! We were glad we had remembered to pack jackets. We stayed at the <a href="http://www.lighthouseresort.net">Lighthouse Oceanfront Resort</a> as part of a little deal where I created them a new website. We had a two-bedroom condo that, when the fog was out, provided us a view of the Pacific from our deck. The girls had much fun on the beach even in the cold; Laura found a real live clam, which stayed real and live until it had set in our minivan for a day, at which point it became real and very ripe. To spend actual time <em>in</em> the water, though, we enjoyed the heated pool at the resort.</p>

<p>The second day we ventured out to check out one of the nearby lighthouses. We tried to figure out how to reach the lighthouse on Cape Disappointment, but couldn&rsquo;t figure out which road to take. So instead we visited the <a href="http://www.funbeach.com/attractions/lighthouse-northhead.html">North Head Lighthouse</a>, and while we couldn&rsquo;t tour it (no children under 7 allowed on the tour), we still had a nice little walk and got some nice pictures of the lighthouse and the coast. Apparently the North Head Lighthouse records some of the strongest winds along the Pacific coast. We didn&rsquo;t quite blow away, but it was seriously breezy.</p>

<p>Having traveled to the coast, the one thing Becky really wanted to eat was seafood. We did a little research and tried out a couple of different places that appeared to be somewhat family-friendly and within our budget. My conclusion is that seafood places in tourist towns must plan to sell you overpriced seafood and then make up for it with terrible service. The first night we tried a place called <a href="http://www.doogersseafoodandgrill.com/">Doogers</a>, and while my food was decent, the server totally forgot to bring me the Diet Pepsi I ordered. Becky&rsquo;s combination platter was completely missing one of its major elements, a fact which wasn&rsquo;t brought to light until Becky decided to ask for help identifying each of the elements on the platter. They went ahead and cooked up a razor clam and brought it out to her at the end of the meal, but still, come on, folks. The second night we tried The Crab Pot, supposedly a local favorite since 1946. We thought that surely it would be an improvement over Doogers. No such luck. Higher prices, poorer food, and incredibly awful service.</p>
<p>Still, though, we found a local bakery that was fantastic, and overall very much enjoyed ourselves in Long Beach. It would have been fun to have another day to spend traipsing around, but our schedule called us to move on. Next up: Yakima, en route to Leavenworth.</p>

Sadly, though&hellip; well, maybe not so sadly, I&rsquo;ve been vacationing rather than blogging. :-) I have been taking lots of pictures, though, so they&rsquo;ll show up eventually, along with some thoughts.</p>
<p>Short summary, though: Andrew and Heather were married yesterday evening in a beautiful outdoor ceremony.

			 <p>Day 1 of our vacation finally brings us to Seattle. Our flights were only delayed a little - we arrived at SEA maybe 30 minutes after our scheduled arrival time. Our luggage came through intact. (Had we known that the minivan we are renting had built-in child seats, we could&rsquo;ve saved ourselves one piece of luggage&hellip; but ah well.)</p>
<p>The girls handled the trip wonderfully. Addie was mostly excited about seeing all the airplanes - her little nose was pasted to the window as much as possible, though she had to be up on her knees to see out the plane window - she&rsquo;s too short to see out otherwise! Laura&rsquo;s greatest excitement came from seeing the mountains out the airplane window. She&rsquo;s never been to the mountains before, and when she saw the snowcaps, she let out a loud whoop, and kept yelling &ldquo;Mountains, Mommy, mountains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got in our aforementioned minivan and headed the few miles to our hotel. I was thinking the van felt a little funny but wasn&rsquo;t quite sure. When we got to the hotel, it was definitely feeling funny&hellip; and yep, there was a flat tire on the back. Ugh. As frustrating as it was to have rented a vehicle with a flat right off the lot, I must say that Alamo handled it pretty well - I called the local rental place, they told me that it&rsquo;d be no charge since it was right off the lot, they forwarded me to roadside assistance who had somebody at my location within 45 minutes to put on the spare. Then I drove the van on the donut spare back to SEATAC to exchange it for a different van. That was an hour and a half I would have preferred not to waste, but hey, it&rsquo;s done now.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&rsquo;re headed down to spend a couple days on the coast. Can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s starting to hit home that one week from now we will be on an airplane, with the kiddos, headed for our Washington vacation and Andrew&rsquo;s wedding. We&rsquo;ve gotten to the list-making stage. What all do we need to take? What will the weather be like? (It&rsquo;s a lot different on the coast than it is in Leavenworth where the wedding will be!) What suitcases are we taking along? How many bags will we have to check? Do we have seats assigned on all the flights? And on and on and on.</p>
<p>For me, the most stressful part of the trip is from now until we are at Seatac with a rental car and all our bags. After that, it&rsquo;s all downhill. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really gonna be as bad as I&rsquo;m worried it will be&hellip; but I can be a good worrier. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this vacation, though - both for Andrew &amp; Heather&rsquo;s wedding and just for the chance to get away - almost 2 full weeks away from the office once you count the holiday this week and then our trip. It&rsquo;ll be so nice.</p>
<p>Stay focused, Chris&hellip; still three more days of work.</p>

			 <p>Ten years ago today, on a sweltering night in Charlotte, NC, friends and family gathered as Becky and I exchanged our vows and became husband and wife. I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot about the ceremony itself; the pictures, though, show a geeky boy of 21 looking warm in a basic tuxedo, and a girl looking beautiful if a bit uncomfortable in a white dress and veil. We look so young! Were we really ready to start upon a lifetime together?</p>
<p>Ten years later we have been through much. New places to live, new jobs, new friends; two beautiful little girls added to our family; a lot of what we promised in our vows: sometimes better, sometimes worse, sometimes richer, sometimes poorer, sometimes sickness, sometimes health. One of the few constants through it all has been my wife Becky by my side, supporting, encouraging, and loving me. While we have our ups and downs, we truly do make a great team.</p>
<p>That night ten years ago my buddy Daniel sang a song that Rich Mullins wrote that included these lines:</p>
<p><em>If you find a love that&rsquo;s tender, If you find someone who&rsquo;s true Then thank the Lord - He&rsquo;s been doubly good to you.</em></p>
<p>And truly He has been good. I love you, Becky, and thanks for 10 wonderful years.</p>

			 <p>Once today is complete I will have only 6 more working days until vacation&hellip; and oh my, am I ever looking forward to it. My brother Andrew is getting married on July 12 and we are using that as an excuse to take a week&rsquo;s vacation to Washington. (The state, not the district.) We have several days of sightseeing and relaxation scheduled around the wedding, and it should be a great time. We&rsquo;ll hit Seattle, the Pacific coast, the mountains, and back to Seattle before heading home.</p>
<p>Preparations have been in a lull for a while - there was the frenzy months ago when we purchased our airline tickets, made hotel reservations, etc, but then we put it aside and it&rsquo;s just been lurking&hellip; and now we are back to planning in earnest. At this point Becky is starting to figure out what all needs to be brought along, how we can fit it into as few bags as possible, and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit it - the one thing I&rsquo;m nervous/fearful of on this trip is the airline travel. We&rsquo;re taking the girls on their first airplane trip, which will be fun, and we&rsquo;ve planned in longish layovers, to try to ensure things go smoothly&hellip; but it&rsquo;s still a cross-country airline trip, and we&rsquo;re still connecting through Chicago O&rsquo;Hare. I will be praying much that things just go smoothly. Once we&rsquo;re in Seattle with our rental car and all our baggage, the next week should be just brilliant fun.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my little update for today. I&rsquo;ll try for a more substantive post tomorrow as a major milestone occurs in the Hubbs household.</p>

			 <p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t done a meme in a while, and <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2008/06/18/top-ten-movies/">Jeff tagged me for this one</a>, so I&rsquo;ll give it a go.</p>
<p>The rules of the “game” are simple: 1. list your top ten favorite films (in no particular order). 2. if you’re tagged, you’ve got to post and tag 3-5 other people. 3. give a tag back (some link love) to the one who tagged you in your post 4. give a hat tip (HT) to Dan (I have no idea who Dan is, but hey, there ya go).</p>
<p>This is gonna be a challenge for me, because I haven&rsquo;t watched that many movies lately, and really, how do you go about choosing favorites? Simply by number of times watched? At least you&rsquo;ll get 10 from me here that I really like. Maybe not the 10 greatest movies I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but 10 that I&rsquo;d be happy to sit down and watch again semi-regularly or would recommend to a friend. Oh, and off the top, I&rsquo;m not gonna say Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, because they&rsquo;re almost prerequisites for this kind of list, and it seems boring. So, in no particular order&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Princess Bride An oldie but goodie. Yes, I can quote far too much of it. But to leave it off the list would be, well, inconceivable. And how can you dislike a movie with Andre the Giant?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lost in Translation Bill Murray. So good. Scarlett Johannson. Amazing. Slow, light on plot, heavy on atmosphere. I loved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Thing You Do So I&rsquo;m a sucker for a movie about musicians who briefly make the bigtime. Tom Hanks is such a fantastic character in this movie, and yeah, if I&rsquo;m one of the guys in the film, hands down, I&rsquo;m the drummer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiddler on the Roof I really need to include a musical on here somewhere, and Fiddler is a great musical. It&rsquo;s been far too long since I&rsquo;ve watched this one. But Topol captures Tevye so well, and the songs are classics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once OK, so I&rsquo;m gonna include a second musical on here, and it&rsquo;s gonna be a film that I&rsquo;ve only seen, well, once. Low-budget, first-time actors, but the story feels <em>real</em> in a way that very few films seem to manage. I need to buy this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apollo 13 Jeff mentioned this one in his list, but I&rsquo;m gonna include it here, too. Sure, Tom Hanks is great in the starring role, but Ed Harris is the guy that makes the movie for me. And how can I not love a movie where the true heroes are nerdy engineers? Can <em>you</em> build a CO2 scrubber from this random assortment of parts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat Michael Mann at his best, and Pacino and DeNiro to boot. A big crime drama, spread across Southern California, with the atmosphere and expanse that Mann seems to do so well. Oh, and did I mention Pacino and DeNiro?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Matrix Can we just forget that this is supposedly the beginning of a movie trilogy? This movie works so well by itself - the cyberpunk genre, the stop-action camera work, the ridiculous action scenes&hellip; so much fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Too many of the old song-and-dance movies were very weakly plotted, with just enough plot to string things together between musical numbers. Mitty isn&rsquo;t one of those. Yes, it provides ample opportunity for Danny Kaye to mug for the camera, do some hilarious song-and-dance routines (how can you not love Anatole of Paris?), and generally cut up, but they actually belong as part of the plot. Lots of fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L.A. Confidential It was harder than I thought coming up with a tenth film, but this one deserves a spot here. A gritty film noir filled with all the elements you could want - dirty cops, femme fatales, Hollywoord in its heyday. Add in Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell, and you&rsquo;ve got a great film.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, then, who to tag? <a href="http://www.raewhitlock.com">Rae</a>. <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">CanaDan</a>. <a href="http://mrsxb.blogspot.com">Bridget</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/06/18/i-tried-opera.html">I tried Opera for a day</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>No, Dad, regardless of the title, I&rsquo;m not talking about Wagner or Puccini or that kind of opera&hellip; sorry. But with Firefox 3 coming out yesterday, I figured I&rsquo;d be the contrarian and give that other browser a try; Opera was promising more features with version 9.5, and I hadn&rsquo;t played with Opera in quite a while. So yesterday was Opera trial day. Mind you, I&rsquo;m a quite-happy Firefox user, but I figured I should give it a try.</p>
<p>My first impression when starting Opera: It&rsquo;s pretty. I like the UI, though admittedly I&rsquo;m a sucker for new, shiny toys. But it looks good. And the rendering looks good, and it seems fast. So far, so good. Sadly, on my list of comments/thoughts about Opera, that&rsquo;s pretty much the end of the good things.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s my list of annoyances. First stop: Gmail. I keep Gmail open all the time, and use the Google Talk function embedded in Gmail as my primary chat engine. It seems to be the only thing that&rsquo;ll function here at work. Well, the GTalk panel doesn&rsquo;t even load in Gmail. Quick Google search, and ah, I can use the &amp;nobrowsercheck option in the URL. Then it shows up. Cool!</p>
<p>But it ends up there&rsquo;s a reason Gmail doesn&rsquo;t load chat in Opera; it doesn&rsquo;t work. You can&rsquo;t initiate a chat with anybody from the chat panel, it won&rsquo;t pop up the little window. If someone else starts the chat, then you can pop it up, but you can&rsquo;t pop it out; it&rsquo;s stuck within the main Opera window. No good to me.</p>
<p>Another Google search provides my next try for GTalk: load it up in the &ldquo;Panel&rdquo; aka sidebar. It loads up better there, but again you can&rsquo;t pop out chat sessions; they&rsquo;re all stuck within the panel. Given that I like to have more than one session going at once at times, this just won&rsquo;t work for me. Bummer.</p>
<p>Oh, and as long as I&rsquo;m talking about searches - one weird thing: the hotkey to get up to the search box is different between Opera and Firefox/IE. FF/IE both use CTRL-K to put your cursor in the search box. Opera uses CRTL-E. Would it have been that hard to stay consistent?</p>
<p>Firefox users who check out Opera quickly notice that there are no extensions for Opera like there are for Firefox. Opera proponents quickly point out that some of the most popular &ldquo;extended&rdquo; functionality in Firefox is built-in to Opera natively; they cite Mouse Gestures and Content Blocking as examples. Now, Mouse Gestures I have to give them. I love using Mouse Gestures and they work well in Opera. Content Blocking&hellip; not so much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hooked on Adblock for Firefox. It just works. The net it casts for ads catches most all the ads without filtering out the pictures I want to see. Opera has a built-in &ldquo;content blocker&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s not very user-friendly. Right-click on a blank area of the screen, and choose Block Content. Then it highlights all the blockable items on the screen. Then you have to click on the ones you want to block. By default, it blocks everything from a pretty high level in the domain the ad is hosted. This is fine if the ad you&rsquo;re blocking is from an adserver, but for some of the sites I visit, the ads are hosted right on the domain&hellip; which means Opera ends up blocking ALL the images from that domain, including the ones I want. Yes, you can fine-tune it, but it requires opening up another dialog, and it&rsquo;s a pain. I&rsquo;ll take the Adblock extension for Firefox any day.</p>
<p>Other little annoyances: I&rsquo;ve grown to love the Remember The Milk extension for Firefox that embeds my to-do list into my Gmail screen. Not available in Opera. The drag-and-drop arrangement for my fantasy baseball team in Yahoo Fantasy Sports? Not available in Opera. It&rsquo;s little things like that here and there that make my choice easy.</p>
<p>This morning with some relief I clicked on my Firefox shortcut and was happy to see FF version 3 loading up. This is a browser worth keeping.</p>

			 <p>Father&rsquo;s Day 2008 wasn&rsquo;t quite what any of us had been planning, but it&rsquo;s still gone pretty well. After finishing a tasty breakfast that Becky made for me, we spent most of the morning and afternoon cleaning up the basement - washing things down with a bleach solution, sweeping up dirt and grime, repacking boxes that had gotten wet, scraping peeling paint off the walls, and starting to repaint. Slowly it&rsquo;s coming back together.</p>
<p>Tonight we went out to Chili&rsquo;s for supper, and while the food was quite tasty, it was weird to have it served on paper plates and in plastic cups with plastic utensils. With all of Cedar Rapids still on a water conservation plan, though, everyone in the city is doing something similar. Thankfully they were able to get a second water pumping station back online today, so the risk of totally losing water has lessened considerably, and the restrictions on water use have eased a bit. People are quite happy they can take showers once again.</p>
<p>By tomorrow night or Tuesday at the latest we should have stuff mostly put back together and have it feel more like &ldquo;normal&rdquo; at home; it&rsquo;ll probably be the end of the week before the river has receded and we can see how many roads will need repaired before they can be used again. It will be nice to have the bridges back open, though; if they are all closed for too much longer it will become quite difficult to bring in trucks of supplies to restock the stores. But I think it&rsquo;s going to turn out OK.</p>
<p>It will be a long rebuilding process for Cedar Rapids. It won&rsquo;t be weeks or months; it&rsquo;ll be years. There are thousands of houses to repair or demolish and rebuild; hundreds of businesses that have been severely damaged, bridges and roads that have been totally washed away; the heart of the city decimated by a deluge the scale of which we have never before seen. But the sunshine gives us hope - an internal assurance that the sorrow now measured by muddy waterlines on painted siding will be eventually superseded by the joy of new buildings, fresh paint, and restored community. Through it all, we hope and trust that God is good. And tomorrow morning we will find new mercies.</p>

			 <p>What a beautiful day today was. Sunshine, cool temps&hellip; such a nice change from the weeks of rain. We&rsquo;re even forecast to get several more sunny days here over the next week. Let&rsquo;s pray that it happens.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve had shop vacs of one sort or another running continuously in the basement now for about 30 hours. I finally went and bought one of my own so I wouldn&rsquo;t keep being scared of burning out the motor on a borrowed vac. :-) The water has slowed down to the point where I don&rsquo;t think much maintenance will be needed&hellip; which is a very good feeling. We&rsquo;ve still got a lot of cleanup to do, but we&rsquo;ll leave all the fans and the dehumidifier running all night and I imagine we&rsquo;ll be in pretty good shape tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you who have prayed, called, emailed, and otherwise checked in. We were blessed here in Hiawatha to be on high ground. There are thousands down in Cedar Rapids who will be demolishing and rebuilding houses and businesses over the next months and years. It&rsquo;s going to be a long, difficult recovery.</p>
<p>I mentioned it to Dad this morning on the phone: as soon as the water showed up in my basement, I started praying for good weather with an incredible fervor. Barely had the first prayer left my lips, though, then I felt a sense of guilt - why was I only praying now, when the water had been in <em>other people&rsquo;s</em> basements, homes, and businesses, for days now? I am reminded that I need to hold up my neighbors in prayer with the same attention that I pray for myself and my family. A good lesson to learn, even in the midst of the flood.</p>

			 <p>No time to post pictures but if you visit any online news site you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly be able to see the pictures of Cedar Rapids, IA. When the river crests tomorrow (God willing), it will be about 12 feet above, not flood stage, but 12 feet above the previously-highest measured flood. Twenty feet above flood stage.</p>
<p>We are on high ground here in Hiawatha, but very wet, saturated ground. The water started coming up through the cracks in the basement floor about 1 pm on Thursday, and we&rsquo;ve been running two Shop Vacs non-stop since then (14 hours now). We&rsquo;re keeping up with it, but only just. It hasn&rsquo;t rained for almost seven hours now, so I keep thinking (hoping) that the water level will go down enough that it&rsquo;ll stay out of the basement. I guess we&rsquo;ll find out. For now, we&rsquo;re just praying for no more rain and for these shop vacs to hold out. I doubt they were designed to run this long this hard.</p>
<p>We have an internet connection finally here at home (it was out for 24 hours due to the flooding), so I&rsquo;ll try to post updates if I get a chance.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a weird year for weather here in Iowa. We started with the snowiest winter on record. Once that melted, we had an unusually cool spring. Now we&rsquo;re finishing up spring and headed toward summer, and the rain has been nearly unstoppable. Seems like every day is another thunderstorm, bringing an inch (or two) (or three) of rain.</p>
<p>Now the flooding has begun. Already three of the bridges crossing the Cedar River in Cedar Rapids have been closed because the river has reached (or nearly reached) the bottom of the bridge. Mandatory evacuations have been declared for low-lying areas of town. A flood totally took out the railroad bridge up in Cedar Falls. They&rsquo;ve got a fully-loaded train sitting on our railroad bridge here in Cedar Rapids to try and keep it from being swept away, too. (This picture is of a different bridge in CR.)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A lot of the low-lying areas are well known for flooding, but this one (near Ellis Park on the SW side of CR) is still stunning:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And there&rsquo;s rain on the way again this morning. And tonight. And tomorrow. It&rsquo;s gonna get better before it gets worse. Now, friends, fortunately our house is far away from the river, and on high ground; we&rsquo;re in no danger of flooding; however, we have friends and co-workers who are currently in the process of sandbagging, packing up, and evacuating. Let&rsquo;s pray that this rain stops, very soon.</p>

			 <p>I had three things on my to-do list for the weekend as of last Friday afternoon. And though I kept busy all weekend, those three things are still on my to-do list. How did that happen? I suppose I could do like Becky does and add items to my to-do list after I&rsquo;ve done them just so I can cross them off. But when you use an on-line list that removes completed items from view, there&rsquo;s not a lot of satisfaction in it.</p>
<p>Still, I managed to get a bunch of stuff done around the house: mowed the lawn, cleaned out the gutters and installed some gutter guard, did the dishes (well, at least unloaded and loaded the dishwasher). Led music for both Saturday night and Sunday morning church services. Took the girls to the park to play in the splash pad. Laura, who last year was too scared of the water to even want to get wet, was running through the sprayers yesterday with great enthusiasm. I foresee many trips to the park this summer.</p>
<p>And now it&rsquo;s Monday again. I guess I&rsquo;ll be hitting &lsquo;postpone&rsquo; on those tasks a few more times.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks now but there was great excitement among the little girls in our house because we bought a nice set of bunk beds at a garage sale and set them up in Laura&rsquo;s room. Laura is now the proud owner of a &ldquo;big bed&rdquo; - a real twin-sized bed with real sheets and pillow. We&rsquo;ve set up the upper bunk as well (the pictures were taken before it got set up) and while we don&rsquo;t have any immediate plans to move Addie in with Laura, I imagine it&rsquo;ll happen eventually.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s time for some before-and-after pictures, well, of a sort. Back in November 2005 when Laura was 16 months old and we knew that Addie was on the way, we set up a new crib for Laura and she wanted to help assemble it. This was the scene:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been in Montreal since Monday night, and it&rsquo;s my first trip here, and for that matter, my first trip out of the country. I don&rsquo;t have any profound essays to write but a bunch of little observations that work most easily as bullet points. So here goes.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s the little things that mess with you. Ordered a Whopper at Burger King the other night (I was craving the fries) and was asked if I wanted &ldquo;the trio&rdquo;. What in the world is &ldquo;the trio&rdquo;? Ends up that&rsquo;s what I know better as a combo. [lightbulb goes on]</li>
<li>The roads are bad. They aren&rsquo;t marked very well, the lanes are narrow, and the traffic is horrible.</li>
<li>The other weird traffic thing: rapidly-flashing green lights. As far as I can tell, a rapid green is equivalent to a green left arrow in the US; it&rsquo;s letting you know that it&rsquo;s safe to turn left, because the folks opposite you still have a red. Rather non-intuitive, but it works once you get the hang of it.</li>
<li>Sewing machine stores in shopping malls. Apparently people in Canada really like to sew or something.</li>
<li>A big report came out today in Montreal that is the result of a year-long commission holding hearings and taking suggestions on how to deal with all the ethnic and cultural issues they have in Quebec. It&rsquo;s interesting listening to talk radio this afternoon to hear what people have to say about it. The commission&rsquo;s conclusion is that the worst of the division is more stirred up by the media than by the ethnic groups involved. Figures.</li>
<li>Of course French is the predominant language here in Montreal, but pretty much everyone I&rsquo;ve run into switches pretty much effortlessly into English. Still, it frustrates me a bit that they have to; it feels like I&rsquo;m making them do me a favor rather than being able to just interact with them on their terms.</li>
<li>Tim Horton&rsquo;s (a donut/breakfast chain - think a Canadian Dunkin' Donuts) has tasty food, but no trash cans. Weird. It feels like a fast food, there are lots of tables to sit and eat&hellip; but apparently they expect you to just leave your trash on the table. Very strange.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, enough of that. Still, it&rsquo;s been an interesting place to visit. Tomorrow I fly home.</p>

			 <p>So today was the day I finally ventured outside the good &lsquo;ol US of A; traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the next round of SC-213 meetings. No big details, pictures, or etc so far, but it was nice to actually have decent travel this time around. The flights were more or less on time, the lines were short, the rental car big enough (the PT Cruiser has an amazing amount of leg and head room!) and the hotel comfortable.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just after midnight and I&rsquo;m sitting up too late working on an andrewosenga.net redesign. I finally got the layout working more or less how I want it&hellip; now it&rsquo;s time to make it pretty. Well&hellip; that can wait until tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Apparently this is something that goes by generations, too.

<p>Today I decided to wear my Beaker t-shirt. No sooner did I come home this morning (Becky&rsquo;s not feeling well) than they both pointed at the shirt and asked, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that guy?&rdquo; So here they are, doing their best Beaker impressions.</p>

			 <p>I have a couple other posts floating around in my head, but need to gather some thoughts (and pictures) before writing them. So&hellip; a little this&rsquo;n&rsquo;that, aka bullet points for a Tuesday morning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Softball last night was fantastic. Beautiful weather, good competitive game. Oh, and we won.</li>
<li>Not my favorite: opposing pitchers who whine about us taking walks when they are unable to throw a strike.</li>
<li>Definitely my favorite: Becky, who struck out (looking!) said whiny pitcher to start the seventh inning.</li>
<li>My list of projects is getting long. I&rsquo;ve accomplished some, but others are going to slide right into June without me even touching them. :-(</li>
<li>Next week: headed to Montreal. Looking forward to it.</li>
<li>Also next week: Becky&rsquo;s folks come to visit. This will be two years in a row that they&rsquo;ve come to visit the week that I&rsquo;ve been on travel. Hmmm&hellip; wonder what I should infer from that?</li>
<li>These <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/12/fractal-drawers.html">Fractal Drawers</a> might be one of the coolest things I&rsquo;ve ever seen&hellip; at least this week. (Saw them on Boing Boing, then <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Daniel</a> shared them, too&hellip; thanks Dan!)</li>

			 <p>Some weeks ago Becky and I were enjoying a date night with a stop at our local Coldstone ice cream shop when we overheard some college students discussing a plan - a plan we liked so much we decided to turn it into a tradition of our own. It&rsquo;s really quite simple: the first day in the spring and summer that the high temperature for the day surpasses the next 10-degree mark, we go for ice cream.</p>
<p>It just so happened that our date night weeks ago was on the first 70-degree day of the year. And it just so happened that yesterday was the first 80-degree day of the year. So after getting a bunch of outside work done, we packed the girls up in the van and headed for Coldstone. I figure we have at least two ten-degree trips still coming this season, and if, God forbid, we hit the third (110°F), we&rsquo;ll at least be happy for the relief!</p>
<p>So here are a few pictures from the night. Oh, and our ice cream flavors:</p>
<p>Addie: Chocolate with sprinkles Laura: Cotton Candy with white chocolate chips Becky: Chocolate &amp; Coffee with cookie dough me: Cake Batter Chocolate with cookie dough</p>

<li>Crock Pot cord repaired: complete.</li>
<li>Music leading both Saturday night and Sunday morning: yep.</li>
<li>Double-edged sword: if I had the Versus channel I could&rsquo;ve watched the Dallas Stars play last night. On the other hand, had I stayed up to watch, I would&rsquo;ve had to watch until the fourth OT to see them win.</li>

			 <p>Last night was the start to our church league softball season. For most of the day it looked like we might not even play a game; the weather was quite nasty in the morning, with near-freezing temperatures, strong wind, and sleet. But the bitter morning gave way to a merely blustery evening, and so we made our way out to Noelridge Park to another season like the rest, save that this time we were bundled in multiple layers of shirts, sweats, and stocking caps.</p>
<p>Looks like we might have a good team this year. We&rsquo;ve added a few new guys (and one older guy) from Noelridge who have skills, a catcher who managed to catch a foul fly for an out in her first-ever game (hi Bridget!) and our defense looks passable. I switched around from my usual third base last night to play first, and that worked out just fine. Not a lot of action, but managed to catch everything and make one stretch to get a bang-bang double play called our way.</p>
<p>In theory we&rsquo;re starting up another league on Friday night with some folks from work, but right now the forecast says rain on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday&hellip; so I guess we&rsquo;ll see. Sure is fun to get back to playing softball.</p>

			 <p>One of the things that just fascinates me is observing the girls' learning - not just <em>what</em> they learn but <em>how</em> they learn. Sure, I&rsquo;m a nerd, but thinking not just that &ldquo;hey, she used a funny word&rdquo; but realizing how that particular word reflects the fact that she&rsquo;s learning about verb tenses (without even knowing it!) just blows me away.</p>
<p>Recent highlight: Laura, looking at a book of nursery rhymes in the van yesterday on our way home from the mall. It&rsquo;s not a book we&rsquo;ve read to her very many times. And she&rsquo;s not reading yet, so what she does is look at the pictures in the book, recite from memory as much as she can, and then improvise based on what she understands from the pictures. So Becky and I are sitting in the front seat talking, and soon we hear this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker man, bake me a cake as fast as you can. Pat it, and roll it, and mark it&hellip; um&hellip; with some frosting&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilarity ensued.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;m rather a new-music junkie. Granted, it&rsquo;s gotta be in a genre I&rsquo;m interested in, but hook me up with a new artist and I&rsquo;ll go whole hog. This week, on the recommendation of <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Daniel</a>, I&rsquo;ve been exploring the music of composer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass">Philip Glass</a>. I didn&rsquo;t know much about Philip Glass before this week; if you&rsquo;d asked me I would have remembered that he was very into minimalism and possibly 12-tone music, but that&rsquo;s about it. I would&rsquo;ve guessed that he&rsquo;s not my cup of tea whatsoever. But, having been promised that his newer works were more accessible, I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>My first stop: <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/">Glass&rsquo;s personal website</a>. It has a nice overview of his stuff and also&hellip; an <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/audioplayer/audioplayer.html">audio player</a>! The player gives a pretty nice sampling of his stuff. It includes cuts from his music for the movie <em>The Hours</em>, which is beautiful stuff. It also has a sampling of his <em>Etudes for Piano</em> which I found to be very nice. Then there&rsquo;s some weird stuff - for instance, the soundtrack for a very weird independent art film called <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em>. Definitely enough good stuff to get me interested, though.</p>
<p>My next stop: the local library. I currently have checked out to me nearly every Philip Glass CD that&rsquo;s in their system. While it&rsquo;s not an extensive collection, it&rsquo;s enough to get a sampling. There&rsquo;s the recording of his String Quartets - fairly nice. Then there&rsquo;s <em>Einstein on the Beach</em>, which is a whopping four (four!) CDs of &ldquo;opera&rdquo;, though it&rsquo;s not like any opera you&rsquo;ve ever heard or thought of. It&rsquo;s either brilliant or totally bizarre&hellip; maybe a bit of both. Following that I&rsquo;ve been listening to his Symphony #4, <em>Heroes</em>. It, too, is pretty good. I still have <em>Dance Nos. 1 - 5</em> and <em>music in twelve parts</em> to sample, though I doubt I&rsquo;m going to find them as enjoyable; I know from some online reading that <em>twelve parts</em> is his serious work in the twelve-tone motif, which is too far down the esoteric path for me.</p>
<p>I still want to get my hands on <em>Symphony #1</em>, which Daniel highly recommended; the little samples on Amazonmp3.com sound good. Other than that, I feel like I&rsquo;ve at least given Glass a good shot this week.</p>
<p>My conclusions: The soundtrack from <em>The Hours</em> is a keeper and will get regular play time. The piano etudes probably will as well. Symphonies 1 and 4 are probably worth having and will get played semi-regularly. The older, more esoteric stuff is somewhat interesting, but probably not something that I&rsquo;d listen to much. But hey, it&rsquo;s a new musical discovery, and one that found me some good new music, at that. Thanks, Daniel!</p>

			 <p>Signs that spring is finally here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warmer weather, finally. high temps in the 70&rsquo;s for the majority of this week. Woohoo!</li>
<li>The grill has been retrieved from its exile in the shed and is being prepared for some cooking. We&rsquo;re gonna use it for the first time this season tomorrow.</li>
<li>The snowblower has been exiled to the shed, taking the grill&rsquo;s place.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve sown grass seed in our annual attempt to get grass to grow under the oak tree on the west side of the house. I will try to be consistent with watering this year and see if we can get something going.</li>
<li>Softball! We had our first (and probably only) softball practice last night. This morning my throwing elbow is quite sore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with spring comes my list-making of all the house tasks that need done now that the weather&rsquo;s warmer. The driveway is in sad shape and needs patching - this winter was really hard on it. (Really, we&rsquo;ll need to replace the driveway within the next few years.) The trip and soffet on the house needs scraped and repainted. We need to keep replacing windows. The garage door really needs replaced, but it can wait one more year. On the smaller list, I need to clean out and organize the garage, and get the pegboard hung in the basement. And the list goes on&hellip; and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m forgetting things.</p>
<p>Still&hellip; the weather is warm, the sun is shining&hellip; I&rsquo;m not gonna complain.</p>

			 <p>For a family that didn&rsquo;t travel a whole lot when I was growing up, we have certainly made up for it in the past half-dozen years: Ryan spent a semester at St. Andrews in Scotland, Aaron, Andrew, and Rebecca all spent significant amounts of time with YWAM in Panama, and Mom and Dad (and Ryan, too, come to think of it) took at least one trip down there to visit them. Oh, and Rebecca went to China with YWAM while she was doing her DTS, too. Which leaves one person in the family who has yet to leave the country: little ol' me. The grief I get is multiplied when you realize I&rsquo;m married to a missionary kid who spent time in Indonesia.</p>
<p>But today is the first start in just a little change in that regard; I got travel booked to go to Montreal for a week in May for a industry committee meeting. Now, in some senses, Canada shouldn&rsquo;t even really count; it&rsquo;s not that far away, they mostly speak the same language, I mean, come on, it&rsquo;s <em>Canada</em>. But since a) the ridiculous US Gov&rsquo;t now requires a passport to travel there (well, technically, just to come home, but, yeah) and b) I&rsquo;m going to Quebec, where they speak French, well, I&rsquo;ll reluctantly count it as an out-of-country experience.</p>
<p>I got an automated email from the company&rsquo;s travel agent reminding me that I would need the passport when traveling internationally, and they linked me to the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1082.html">US Dept of State&rsquo;s page on traveling to Canada</a>, which I dutifully visited. I did find this bit regarding traffic to be amusing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highway 401, from Detroit to Montreal, is one of the busiest highways in North America. It has been the scene of recurrent, deadly traffic accidents due to sudden, severe and unpredictable weather changes, high rates of speed, and heavy truck traffic. There have been numerous incidents involving road racing and dangerous truck driving, which have caused injuries to Americans. Drivers tend to be aggressive, often exceeding speed limits and passing on both sides, and police enforcement is spotty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, that doesn&rsquo;t sound too different from interstates I&rsquo;ve been on in the US. Still, I&rsquo;ll probably stay off 401. :-)</p>
<p>The trip isn&rsquo;t for a month yet, so I&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to obsess over the little details that tend to drive my nerves crazy. I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be that bad&hellip; I just like to have my bases covered.</p>

<li>FINALLY with some warmer weather here in Iowa. Softball is supposed to start in two weeks and it&rsquo;s been too cold to get out to practice. Tomorrow, though, we&rsquo;re supposed to hit 70. Hallelujah!</li>
<li>I drove to Naperville, IL last Friday to see <a href="http://andrewosenga.com">Andy O</a>, <a href="http://www.ericpeters.net">Eric Peters</a>, and <a href="http://www.jeremycasella.com">Jeremy Casella</a> play a concert. Hung out with them before and after the show (with the &ldquo;after&rdquo; including pizza at Giordanos!), had a great time. What a great group of guys, and so darn talented to boot.</li>
<li>I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157604497778892/">posted a bunch of pictures</a> from the concert on Flickr.</li>
<li>My Flickr Pro account (gifted from Geof last year) is about to expire. I want to pay to continue it for another year, but for some reason when I go to pay it won&rsquo;t accept my password&hellip; the same password it just accepted for me to log in. It happens on two different browsers. Something funky is going on.</li>
<li>What, you say, it&rsquo;s tax day today? Somehow April 15 is a lot less exciting when you&rsquo;ve had your taxes filed and refund in hand for a couple months already.</li>
<li>And to come full circle, back to softball. We&rsquo;re actually going to be playing in two different leagues this year: our usual Monday night church league, and then on a Friday-night city league team to which we were invited by a friend of mine from work. Becky had to think all of about two seconds before agreeing to play in the second league&hellip; should be a lot of fun.</li>

			 <p>An original user of Google Reader, some months ago when NewsGator decided to make its products free I decided to switch over and give them a try.  I&rsquo;ve been using Feed Demon for a while now and have been more or less happy with it.</p>
<p>The scary part about switching to a new feed reader for me is establishing a level of trust in it.  The Most Important Thing that a feed reader has to do is to get me all the content.  It can&rsquo;t miss posts.  It can&rsquo;t drop &lsquo;em.  If it got posted on a feed I&rsquo;m subscribed to, it better show up.   And a couple of weeks ago I started getting suspicious of Feed Demon.   I&rsquo;m subscribed to Andy Osenga&rsquo;s blog feed <em>and</em> his comment feed, and comments started coming through for posts I hadn&rsquo;t yet read.  The blog feed looked OK in Feed Demon, it just wasn&rsquo;t updating.  Strange.  I unsubscribed and re-subscribed to the feed and then it all seemed to work OK again.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today.  I was reading through comments from Geof Morris&rsquo; blog and realized&hellip;  I&rsquo;ve never read that blog post.  I went over to <a href="http://ijsm.org">ijsm.org</a> and found out that I&rsquo;ve missed at least 10 days worth of posts from Geof. Not good. Not good at all.</p>
<p>Feed Demon has a version 2.6.1 Beta available, and I might just give it a try&hellip; but for now I think I&rsquo;m going to return to my trusty friend <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>. I exported OPML from Feed Demon, imported it back into Reader, and everything worked very nicely. It imported my 400-feed OPML file without a hiccup and managed to recognize duplicate subscriptions and not double-subscribe me. Time to give it another go.</p>
<p>In theory I still really like the idea of Feed Demon, what with it allowing local applications on multiple PCs to sync to the same online account, and allow web-based access, too. I&rsquo;m also happy to have a non-Google alternative. (While I&rsquo;m not a Google hater, keeping all the eggs from the same basket always seems like a good idea.) But if I can&rsquo;t trust my feed-reader, well, sorry, it failed Most Important Thing #1.</p>

			 <p>Having noted in chapter three that <em>something</em> happened to cause the early Christians' belief in resurrection to be vastly different from their former religious or cultural beliefs, in chapter 4 N. T. Wright sets out to make the case for a real, historical Easter. He starts out be listing four &ldquo;strange features&rdquo; shared by the accounts in the canonical gospels which, he says, should compel us to take them seriously as early accounts. Those features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The &ldquo;strange silence&rdquo; of the Bible in the stories. Up to this point, the gospel writers consistently used allusions to and quotations from the Old Testament to show that Jesus' death was &ldquo;according to the scriptures&rdquo;. The resurrection narratives, though, have almost no such references. If the resurrection accounts were invented much later, you would expect the writers to stay consistent.</li>
<li>The presence of women as principal witnesses. As has often been remarked upon, women were not regarded as credible witnesses in the ancient world. Yet there they are in all the resurrection accounts.</li>
<li>The portrait of Jesus himself. If the resurrection stories were written later, you&rsquo;d expect a shining, transfigured Jesus. Instead, you get Jesus mistaken for a gardener and as a human being with a body that was in many ways quite normal.</li>
<li>The resurrection accounts never mention the future Christian hope. In every account since then and in every Easter sermon preached, the conclusion is drawn: Jesus is raised, therefore there is life after death. But in these accounts, no such conclusions are drawn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wright goes on to address with great clarity some of the other common objections to the resurrection, including hallucination, cognitive dissonance, the swoon theory, mistaken identity, and the like. Each of them is reasonably discarded.</p>
<p>Finally, Wright concludes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any other historical inquiry, the answer would be so obvious that it would hardly need saying. Here of course, this obvious answer (&ldquo;well, it actually happened&rdquo;) is so shocking, so earth shattering, that we rightly pause before leaping into the unknown. And here indeed, as some skeptical friends have cheerfully pointed out to me, it is always possible for anyone to follow the argument so far and to say simply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a good explanation for what happened to cause the empty tomb and the appearances, but I choose to maintain my belief that dead people don&rsquo;t rise and therefore conclude that something else must have happened, even though we can&rsquo;t tell what it was.&rdquo; That is fine; I respect that position; but I simply note that it is indeed then a matter of choice, not a matter of saying that something called scientific historiography forces us to take that route.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wright&rsquo;s other main argument in chapter four is for those who discount a &ldquo;real&rdquo; resurrection based on &ldquo;science&rdquo;. He notes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;there are different types of knowing. Science studies the repeatable; history studies the unrepeatable&hellip; historians don&rsquo;t of course see this as a problem and are usually not shy about declaring that these events certainly took place, even though we can&rsquo;t repeat them in the laboratory.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But when people say &ldquo;But that can&rsquo;t have happened because we know that <em>that sort of thing</em> doesn&rsquo;t actually happen,&rdquo; then they are appealing to a would-be scientific principle of history, namely, the principle of <em>analogy</em>. The problem with analogy is that it never quote gets you far enough. History is full of unlikely things that happened once and once only, with the result that the analogies are often at best partial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to this chapter but it would be uncharitable to just quote the whole thing. Suffice it to say that Wright very convincingly argues that there is really no good explanation for all that has happened since other than that Jesus was truly resurrected from the dead. &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he notes, &ldquo;human beings - individuals or communities - are confronted with something that they must reject outright or that, if they accept it, will demand the remaking of their worldview.&rdquo; Having thus set out the framework in part one of <em>Surprised by Hope</em>, Wright will continue to discuss what that worldview looks like when it comes to future things.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>Let&rsquo;s start at the very beginning,</em> says a familiar song from a classic musical, <em>it&rsquo;s a very good place to start.</em>. And start at the beginning N. T. Wright does in Chapter 3 of <em>Surprised by Hope</em>. In fact, Wright is in a supremely-qualified position to start at &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; given his preeminence as a New Testament scholar. Wright&rsquo;s question for chapter three is this: how did the early church talk about the resurrection? What was their view? The answers provide some keen insights into truths about the resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>In the ancient Jewish tradition, Wright says, they did have a concept of <em>resurrection</em>. But their view of resurrection wasn&rsquo;t some vague concept of &ldquo;life after death&rdquo;. Instead, what they looked forward to was a bodily resurrection of the righteous at the end of time. When Jesus tells Martha that she will see her brother Lazarus again, and she replies &ldquo;I know he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re talking about. So when the early Jewish writers then spoke of Jesus resurrection and being bodily alive <em>right now</em>, they understood that they were describing something that had never happened before. The resurrection was the thing that set Jesus apart.</p>
<p>Wright then discusses seven ways in which the Christian view of resurrection soon mutated from the traditional Jewish view of resurrection:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Christians, though coming from a broad spectrum of philosophical and religious backgrounds, quickly agreed on a single, &ldquo;two-step&rdquo; view of life after death: a temporary, spiritual time with God until the final, bodily resurrection.</li>
<li>The resurrection became more important - it moved &ldquo;from the circumference to the center&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The understanding of the resurrected body moved from some vague Jewish beliefs to a solid belief in a material, transformed human body.</li>
<li>The early Christians came to understand the resurrection as &ldquo;split into two&rdquo; - the prototype of Jesus resurrection, which points forward then to the resurrection at the end of days.</li>
<li>Because God had inaugurated the resurrection in Jesus, the Christians now &ldquo;believed that God had called them to work with him, in the power of the Spirit, to implement the achievement of Jesus and thereby to anticipate the final resurrection, in personal and political life, in mission and holiness.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The metaphorical use of <em>resurrection</em> changed from being about the restoration of ethnic Israel to being about the restoration of humans in general.</li>
<li>Resurrection became associated with the Jewish views of messiahship. To this point, no one had expected the Messiah to die and be resurrected; from this point on, they understood it to be the case.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important here, Wright says, to see this key development of a very early belief that &ldquo;Jesus is Lord and therefore Caesar is not.&rdquo; This, says Wright,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;is the foundation of the Christian stance of allegiance to a different king, a different Lord. Death is the last weapon of the tyrant, and the point of the resurrection, despite much misunderstanding, is that death has been defeated. &hellip; Resurrection was never a way of settling down and becoming respectable; the Pharisees could have told you that. It was the Gnostics, who translated the language of resurrection into a private spirituality and a dualistic cosmology, thereby more or less altering its meaning into its opposite, who escaped persecution. Which emperor would have sleepless nights worrying that his subjects were reading the Gospel of Thomas? Resurrection was always bound to get you into trouble, and it regularly did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Wright says, there was a definite shift in the religious views as Jews became Christians following Easter. So what happened, really, on that historical Easter? That&rsquo;s the question Wright will address in Chapter 4.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In Chapter 2 of <em>Surprised by Hope</em>, N. T. Wright examines the wide sweep of confusing views that the Church has commonly held about death over the past few centuries. I found them quite familiar. From the stern &ldquo;death is our enemy&rdquo; position all the way over to the &ldquo;death is our friend to take us out of this place&rdquo; end of things, Wright quotes familiar hymns (most of which you&rsquo;ve probably sung in church before) to point out the varied viewpoints. Really, how do you even begin to start to rectify John Donne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death be not proud&hellip; Death, thou shalt die&rdquo;, with <em>Abide With Me</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s morning breaks and earth&rsquo;s vain shadows flee&rdquo;? There&rsquo;s a disconnect there somewhere. Wright reminds us that &ldquo;God&rsquo;s intention is not to let death have its way with us.&rdquo; Death is an enemy, one that has been and will be defeated.</p>
<p>So, then, what about heaven? The common Christian conception of <em>heaven</em>, Wright says, and I find this true in my experience, is that it is &ldquo;&hellip;the appropriate term for the ultimate destination, the final home, and that the language of resurrection, and of the new earth as well as the new heavens, must somehow be fitted into that.&rdquo; Not so, says Wright - &ldquo;there is actually very little in the Bible about &lsquo;going to heaven when you die&rsquo; and not a lot about a postmortem hell either&rdquo;. Rather, Wright says, &ldquo;Heaven, in the Bible, is not a future destiny but the other, hudden, dimension of our ordinary life - God&rsquo;s dimension, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wright goes on to ask a series of questions that he will answer later in the book: What about the human soul? What is it? What do we mean by &ldquo;Jesus coming to judge the living and the dead&rdquo;? What do we mean by &ldquo;the communion of the saints&rdquo;? In this final introductory chapter, Wright definitely impresses us enough that there is widespread confusion, not just from outside the church about the church&rsquo;s beliefs, but from <em>inside</em> as well. It is that confusion that he hopes to iron out in future chapters.</p>

			 <p>So it&rsquo;s been far too long since I posted <a href="/08/03/wrestling-with-tom-an-american-evangelicals-coming-to-grips-with-n-t-wrights-surprised-by-hope/">my original review</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0061551821%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0061551821%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Surprised by Hope</a>, the latest book from N. T. Wright. As you may recall from that review, I found myself stunned by the clarity and richness of Wright&rsquo;s exposition of the doctrines of heaven and the resurrection. (As Wright so cleverly puts it, &ldquo;heaven is important, but it&rsquo;s not the end of the world!&quot;) Finally I&rsquo;m finding some time to come back to it and interact more fully here. <em>Surprised by Hope</em> is split into three broad sections: &lsquo;Setting the Scene&rsquo;, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Future Plan&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Hope in Practice: Resurrection and the Mission of the Church&rsquo;. In this post I want to just address the first chapter, titled &lsquo;All Dressed Up and No Place to Go&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Wright opens <em>Surprised by Hope</em> by positing two questions which he says are often dealt with quite separately but that should really be tied together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, what is the ultimate Christian hope? Second, what hope is there for change, rescue, transformation, new possibilities within the world in the present? And the main answer can be put like this. As long as we see Christian hope in terms of &ldquo;going to heaven,&rdquo; of a salvation that is essentially <em>away from</em> this world, the two questions are bound to appear as unrelated. Indeed, some insist angrily that to ask the second one at all is to ignore the first one, which is the really important one. This in turn makes some others get angry when people talk of resurrection, as if this might draw attention away from the really important and pressing matters of contemporary social concern. But if the Christian hope is for <em>God&rsquo;s new creation</em>, for &ldquo;new heavens and new earth&rdquo;, and if that hope has already come to life in Jesus of Nazareth, then there is every reason to join the two questions together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wright then goes on to highlight just a few of the various beliefs commonly held today regarding death and the afterlife. From the ancestor worship of Africans and Buddhists to the Islamic hope of paradise to the Jewish hope of resurrection, and finally to the Christian view&hellip; but what, exactly, <em>is</em> the Christian view? Wright asserts that while there are many popular views of the afterlife in today&rsquo;s culture, &ldquo;so far as I can tell, <em>most people don&rsquo;t know what orthodox Christian belief is.</em>&rdquo; Yes, there is some belief in &ldquo;life after death&rdquo;, but what form does it take, and in what places? What about this word &ldquo;resurrection&rdquo;? Wright wants to clear up confusion on these issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to do much commentary on this first introductory chapter, but it certainly sets the scene for the book. More to come.</p>

			 <p>I had the opportunity to do the Easter &ldquo;program&rdquo; (if you want to call it that) twice this year: once in a slightly-odd (celebrating Easter on Saturday?) Saturday night service at <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago</a>; the other on Sunday morning at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>. It was a nice change to not have to plan the service this year; I really enjoy just being the pianist and playing behind someone else. Of course, not planning the service means that you get whatever the leader plans. My only real comment in that regard: I am not a fan of Gaither tour DVDs. In fact, I think pretty much any sort of live person-led activity, even of lower technical quality, is preferable to playing a DVD of a song. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>My larger observation, though, is that I think we at Noelridge, and likely the greater evangelical church, miss something by not observing all of Holy Week. Maundy Thursday? What&rsquo;s that? Good Friday? Well, there&rsquo;s a community Good Friday service that we could&rsquo;ve attended, I guess. But it&rsquo;s not really pushed as a priority. We just have an Easter morning service.</p>
<p>What happens, then, is that the Easter morning service turns into an observance of <em>all</em> of Holy Week, and, in our case, turned into 80% (or more) reflections on Christ&rsquo;s death and the cross, and only about 20% (or less) about His resurrection. And the natural result of that is that the message (sandwiched in after all the special music at the end of the service) ends up being a call to unbelievers to believe, with nothing really targeted at believers, other than a reminder of the hope that we have that death is not the end.</p>
<p>Now the influence of N. T. Wright&rsquo;s recent <em>Surprised By Hope</em> on my thinking is going to show. Wright argues strongly that we don&rsquo;t celebrate the Resurrection enough, and I think he&rsquo;s right. He says, and I loosely paraphrase since I don&rsquo;t have the book with me at the moment, that we spend 40 days in sacrifice for Lent (oh, something else we don&rsquo;t do as Baptists) but then Easter is maybe 2 hours on Sunday morning. Instead, Wright says, Easter should be the kickoff day for a full week of celebration. And the message of the Resurrection isn&rsquo;t just for hope that we will go someplace better when we die, but that God is working to redeem and restore the whole of creation, and that we look forward to participating in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>So much still to think through&hellip;</p>

			 <p><em>Read to the end of the blog post - I&rsquo;m giving away a copy of the book!</em></p>
<p>Just when you think you&rsquo;re familiar with a guy&rsquo;s talents&hellip; then <em>this</em> happens.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been an Andrew Peterson fan for a few years now. He is an amazingly-talented songwriter; albums to his credit include my all-time favorite Christmas album, <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em>. He&rsquo;s shown himself to be a bit of a thinker and writer, too; he launched <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com">The Rabbit Room</a> a few months ago and it is now a must-read site with book and music reviews and essays on the arts and faith.</p>
<p>Then I hear the latest news: AP&rsquo;s writing a book. I actually think I got wind of it about 18 months ago from a friend who knows Andy, but had kinda forgotten about it. Now it&rsquo;s for real: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400073847"><em>On The Edge of the Dark Sea of Darkness</em></a>.</p>
<p><em>OTEOTSDOD</em> focuses on the quiet land of Skree, the Igiby children Janner, his younger brother Tink, and their crippled sister Leeli. Oh, and their ex-pirate (are you ever really an &ldquo;ex&rdquo;- pirate?) grandfather. There&rsquo;s something about lost jewels, and a dude whose name is Gnag the Nameless. (How is he nameless, again?) Oh, and there&rsquo;s this thing about toothy cows. Amazing.</p>
<p><em>OTEOTSDOD</em> is a work of fantasy and adventure. It feels a little bit like Narnia, but with much more humor and much less allegory. It feels a bit like Monty Python, but without all the naughty bits that you wouldn&rsquo;t want your kids to see. It feels a bit like <em>The Princess Bride</em>, but without Andre the Giant. And there are footnotes. Can&rsquo;t forget the footnotes.</p>
<p>Being over 30 I might not be in the target demographic for this book, but I loved it none the less. The cover of the book promises that this is just book one of the saga, and talking to Andrew before a concert the other night he confirmed he&rsquo;s working on the next volume. This is a set to add to your bookshelves. Fun to read, probably even more fun to read aloud - I just hope AP doesn&rsquo;t get so popular as an author that he stops making music.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: the publisher gave me a copy of this book to review. Can&rsquo;t say it influenced my review, though - the book really is good.</p>
<p>And now for the giveaway: they gave me an extra copy to giveaway. It&rsquo;s gonna be real simple: leave a comment in reply to this post anytime through March 19. I&rsquo;ll randomly select a winner and send you the copy.</p>
<p>Oh, if you don&rsquo;t win the giveaway, you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400073847">buy the book from Amazon</a>.</p>

			 <p>This morning Laura and Addie and a few of their friends participated in a little fashion show for a Christian women&rsquo;s group. They got to pick out dresses to borrow from a local store and then strut their stuff. I&rsquo;m not sure how much Laura slept last night, she was so excited. Becky managed to get a few pictures of the girls and their friends. Enjoy! (You can click on the pics to see the bigger version on Flickr.)</p>

			 <p>Yeah, so my birthday isn&rsquo;t until Friday, but finalized plans yesterday to be able to not just attend the <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> concert here in Cedar Rapids on Saturday, but also to be the runner for the day, which basically means just hanging out there at the church as they set up and then driving AP and company around anyplace they need to go. I was runner a couple years ago when AP and gang came for the Behold the Lamb of God tour, and it was a blast.</p>
<p>I was afraid it wasn&rsquo;t going to work out, mainly because I have been unable to find a replacement worship leader, so I still have to setup and then lead music for the 5:30 service at <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago</a>. In stepped Becky, who awesomely volunteered to be the runner for me for a couple hours while I do the church service, then I can make it back just in time for the concert. Too much fun.</p>
<p>Andrew Peterson will be touring with Andy Gullahorn, Jill Phillips, Ben Shive, and maybe some others, and will be doing music from his upcoming album <em>Resurrection Letters, Vol. 2</em>. I&rsquo;m listening to a few songs from it right now on a <a href="http://www.michaelcard.com/audio/radio/310.mp3">Michael Card podcast</a> and there&rsquo;s some amazing new stuff. Saturday is going to be fun.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Few writers have gained the attention of, and made waves in, the Christian blogosphere in recent memory in quite the way that N. T. Wright has. (The other that immediately comes to mind is Mark Driscoll, but his similarity with Wright probably ends about right there.) A &ldquo;Lord Bishop&rdquo; (ach, a hierarchical title!) in the Anglican (aren&rsquo;t they all liberals?) Church, Wright is a brilliant yet down-to-earth scholar of the New Testament. He has written a thick three-volume set on Jesus (one volume of which I received as a Christmas gift and am still wading through), a defense and apologetic of Christian beliefs (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0060507152%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0060507152%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Simply Christian</a></em>), and a little book that went off like a bomb in the Reformed world called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0802844456%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0802844456%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">What St. Paul Really Said</a></em>. (As a non-Reformed evangelical, I don&rsquo;t really get what the huge deal is about, though I do appreciate the insights that Wright has to Paul.)</p>
<p>I have been listening to as many of Wright&rsquo;s messages as I could get my hands on over the past year (check out <a href="http://ntwrightpage.com">ntwrightpage.com</a> - a great resource!) and have heard much that seemed to make sense, though it seemed different than what I&rsquo;ve learned in the evangelical church, regarding the resurrection, heaven, and the end times. So when I heard that Wright was writing a book to sum up those arguments, I put it on my to-buy list and grabbed it as soon as it was released.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0061551821%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0061551821%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Surprised By Hope</a></em> runs just over 300 pages (not counting the copious end notes) and is full of the reminder of the hope of Christians not for some ethereal existence in some far-off &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;, but for a resurrected body (similar to Jesus' prototype) and eternal existence as a part of a redeemed and restored creation on the &ldquo;new earth&rdquo;. Wright makes powerful arguments that this hope of resurrection is consistent with the belief of Israelites before Christ, with the belief of the early church, and that it makes much more sense of the gospels and of Paul than do some of today&rsquo;s more popular views of heaven.</p>
<p>I have completed one pass through <em>Surprised By Hope</em> and have managed to mark up almost every page. What I have found has been eye-opening; not so much that it is a hugely different doctrine than what my denomination holds to, but more that it sets out so clearly beliefs that we tend to get muddled up and then just gloss over. Wright hits it on the head in Chapter 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It comes as something of a shock, in fact, when people are told what is in fact the case: that there is very little in the Bible about &ldquo;going to heaven when you die&rdquo; and not a lot about a postmortem hell either. The medieval pictures of heaven and hell, boosted though not created by Dante&rsquo;s classic work, have exercised a huge influence on Western Christian imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a bit later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most Christians today&hellip; remain satisfied with what is at best a truncated and distorted version of the great biblical hope. Indeed, the popular picture is reinforced again and again in hymns, prayers, monuments, and even quite serious works of theology and history. It is simply assumed that the word <em>heaven</em> is the appropriate term for the ultimate destination, the final home, and that the language of resurrection, and of the new earth as well as the new heavens, must somehow be fitted into that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s me. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been taught&hellip; though not so much taught it, because other than a requisite Sunday School class teaching the standard dispensational view of the book of Revelation, we don&rsquo;t teach it much more than the usual thumbnail sketch: heaven is where Christians go when they die. They are there forever in God&rsquo;s presence. It&rsquo;s pretty much an eternal conversation with the saints of old who you want to get to know, and there&rsquo;s some idea of worshiping God, though we&rsquo;re not quite sure what that&rsquo;ll look like, and then the glassy sea, and crowns, and well, yeah, it&rsquo;s a bit muddled. We don&rsquo;t teach it much because we don&rsquo;t have a coherent framework that incorporates the gospel with the resurrection and then applies it to our mission today. Sure, if we&rsquo;re current we&rsquo;ll talk about things like contextualization, of paying attention to the culture and being in the community, but we see it with just the end goal of being &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people so we&rsquo;ll have an in with the non-Christians who we want to tell about Jesus. Wright is saying throughout the book that there&rsquo;s more to it than that, and he makes a powerful argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning on chewing on the book with multiple blog posts over the next week or two; I also now need to make another pass through the New Testament with this new understanding in mind and see how it fits. Oh, and to Dad and to Richard: I have ordered you copies and they&rsquo;re on the way. :-)</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was Day 2 of the RTCA committee meeting here in Augusta. (Why am I posting a day behind, you ask? Because there&rsquo;s free wi-fi in the convention center, but they want $10/day to get it in my room. I don&rsquo;t need it that bad&hellip; so I&rsquo;m only online during the day.) The meetings were rather uneventful.</p>
<p>Traveled around Augusta last night, and was surprised a bit when I drove past the famed Augusta National golf club. For some reason when I picture golf courses I think of them as big, open, in beautiful surroundings. Augusta National (where they play the Masters every year) is plopped down right in the middle of an older, poor part of town. I suppose maybe years ago when they built it it was on the outskirts, but now it&rsquo;s just a walled-off enclave in the middle of the &lsquo;hood. Strange.</p>
<p>Last night I found a shopping mall (boring; all shopping malls are about the same. why do I continue to seek them out?), a bookstore (also the same, but good for buying gifts for the girls), and a steakhouse restaurant (mediocre at best - disappointing). But I spent most of my time at the restaurant and then in the hotel after dinner working through N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>Surprised by Hope</em>. There will be several blog posts on it here in the near future, but let me say right now that this is one of those books that has been an &ldquo;aha&rdquo; book for me. It simply makes sense and puts the pieces together in a way that no book has done for me since reading Lewis&rsquo; <em>Mere Christianity</em> and <em>The Abolition of Man</em> back in college. Oh, and Dad, if you read this: I ordered you a copy this morning, so don&rsquo;t buy one.</p>
<p>Time for the meeting to start again. Gonna make sure those Synthetic Vision Systems are safe.</p>

			 <p>This week has brought me to Augusta, GA for the quarterly <a href="http://rtca.org/comm/Committee.cfm?id=68">SC-213</a> meeting. The inevitable first question/comment I&rsquo;ve gotten from friends when I say Augusta is &ldquo;did you take your golf clubs along?&rdquo; So as a preemptive strike: no, I don&rsquo;t play golf. I&rsquo;ve never hit a ball in my life. Yes, I know they have some fancy course here where they play some tournament every spring. I even know that a guy from Cedar Rapids happened to win that tournament last year. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m gonna be playing it in my spare time. :-) I will probably drive by it at some point just to have done so.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to read the litany of my travel travails; suffice it to say that Monday I was scheduled to get into Augusta (including drive from the Columbia, SC airport and everything) by about 6 pm - I ended up getting in about 10:30 pm. Not so much fun.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of meetings, and it was fairly useful. Last night I was looking for something to do and noticed in the paper that the local ECHL hockey team (the Augusta Lynx) was playing at home. The arena was only six blocks away, so I headed over, bought a ticket, and watched my first hockey game in some time. The game was poorly-attended (maybe 300 present) and the local team gave it a good effort against the first place Texas Wildcatters, but took too many penalties and couldn&rsquo;t seem to pull the trigger and shoot the puck on the few power plays they had. Final score: Texas 3, Augusta 1. (As a side note: I went to look up the Wildcatters to find out where they are located in Texas; their <a href="http://www.wildcattershockey.com">team website</a> actually didn&rsquo;t say, any place that I could find. Poor website content. The <a href="http://www.echl.com/cgi-bin/ppublic.cgi?action=show_team&amp;team_id=28">ECHL site</a> tells me they are in Beaumont, TX.)</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m eating breakfast and getting prepared for another day of meetings reviewing this document my committee is creating. Good times.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/02/25/tim-kellers-the.html">Tim Keller&#39;s The Reason For God - a review</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2008/02/25/tim-kellers-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2008-02-25 09:22:40 -0500">Feb 25, 2008</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Tim Keller has been a favorite speaker of mine for some time now. As pastor of <a href="http://www.redeemer.com/">Redeemer Presbyterian Church</a> in New York City, he reaches thousands each week. He has also become a fixture at pastor&rsquo;s conferences including John Piper&rsquo;s conference in Minneapolis (where I saw Keller in person a couple years ago) and Mark Driscoll&rsquo;s Acts 29 conferences. His dry wit and humor coupled with great insight on ministering to the city make him a must-listen for me.</p>
<p>(As a brief aside, I made this analogy at Piper&rsquo;s conference a couple years ago: if Piper&rsquo;s conference were Star Wars, Mark Driscoll would be Han Solo, Piper would be Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Tim Keller is quite easily Yoda. <em>Quite</em> easily.)</p>
<p>When I heard that he had written a new book, I eagerly ordered it (thank you, <a href="http://wtsbooks.com">wtsbooks.com</a>) and put it at the top of my reading stack.</p>
<p>God and Reason have been hot topics lately in the book world; it seems to be the topic <em>du jure</em> for atheists who want to trash Christianity. Keller&rsquo;s book seems to be something of a response to those books, proposing, as the title suggests, <em>The Reason for God</em>. There has been significant buzz in the Christian blogosphere surrounding the book, and a not-insignificant marketing blitz as well - it&rsquo;s not often that a new Christian apologetic comes complete with <a href="http://www.thereasonforgod.com">its own website</a>.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I found <em>The Reason for God</em> to be underwhelming. Keller spends the first half of the book responding to common objections to Christianity (&ldquo;why is Christianity so exclusive?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can God send people to hell?&rdquo;, etc) and then takes the second half on the positive side of the bargain, explaining why he thinks Christianity is true, and then laying out a bit about Christian beliefs. While the reasoning was solid, it wasn&rsquo;t anything groundbreaking - it&rsquo;s the same stuff you&rsquo;ll find by reading C. S. Lewis' <em>The Abolition of Man</em> and <em>Mere Christianity</em> and N. T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>Simply Christian</em>. In fact, Keller quotes <em>extensively</em> from Lewis and philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a>. Too often it seemed to me Keller should just be suggesting that we buy and read Lewis and Plantinga rather than reading his repackaged version.</p>
<p>The first half of the book kept my interest pretty well, but I will admit to a waning interest and a lot of skimming toward the end. This isn&rsquo;t to say that <em>The Reason for God</em> is a bad book, or not worth reading. Put into the right hands, it could be a good introduction to the rational, logical reasons for Christianity. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d answer all of the serious intellectual doubter&rsquo;s questions, but it&rsquo;d be a start; good for your college seeker, too. But for someone who&rsquo;s already familiar with the arguments, has already read Lewis and the like? Don&rsquo;t bother. Or buy it for the quick read and then give it away. Here&rsquo;s hoping for something more fresh and insightful next time from the capable Dr. Keller.</p>

			 <p>Rest easy, friends, I&rsquo;m not growing some fractional appendage. But I am pretty much tired of winter. Whatever the steps are in dealing with issues, well, I&rsquo;ve moved past frustration and anger on to acceptance. It&rsquo;s just more snow. Half an inch of ice to start it off? Well sure, why not? We can use the variety. I <em>am</em> glad this year, though, for the snowblower.</p>
<p>Two weeks from now I will be jetting off for a week in Augusta, GA. I can hardly wait to feel the warmth. The highs for this upcoming week, per weather.com? 11°F, 14°F, 10°F, and 19°F. Windchills down below zero most of the week. Now, I know that this winter is likely a climatological statistical anomaly that has no bearing on the validity of &ldquo;global warming&rdquo;, but the cynical part of me would like to invite Al Gore to move to Iowa for a few winters like this one. Right about now I&rsquo;d be happy to trade him and move down to Tennessee.</p>
<p>At least when it gets cold in Wisconsin they can call it &ldquo;The Frozen Tundra&rdquo;, and it sounds cool. Here in Iowa it&rsquo;s just more snow and ice and cold. And in Wisconsin they specialize in cheese&hellip; which would go pretty well with this whine.</p>

			 <p>So back in my <a href="/08/02/putting-on-the-miles/">Caedmon&rsquo;s concert post</a>, Daniel commented that he found the length of that road trip to see a concert &ldquo;insane&rdquo;. Being the nerd that I am, I decided an &ldquo;equation of insanity&rdquo; would be appropriate. (<a href="http://www.ijsm.org">Geof&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://ijsm.org/archives/2003/11/26/an-equation-of-motivation/">equation of motivation</a> was an additional piece of inspiration.)</p>
<p>So, without further ado, the equation:</p>
<p>I = (d+t)/qL</p>
<p>Where</p>
<p>I = relative insanity of the trip 
d = distance traveled to the concert 
t = time that trip took 
q = quality of the artist you are going to see 
L = length of the concert.</p>
<p>Of course the tricky thing here is that the q value will vary between persons, so just because you think my trip is insane doesn&rsquo;t mean that I will agree with you. Also, by including not only the distance of the trip but also its' duration, trips like Geof&rsquo;s planned flight to Philly aren&rsquo;t as insane as if he were to, say, drive to Philly.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the issue of <em>theoretical</em> insanity versus <em>actual</em> insanity. For instance, <a href="/06/06/road-trip-andy-o-cd-release-show/">my trip to see Andy O&rsquo;s <em>The Morning</em> release show</a> theoretically should be much more insane because of the distance to Nashville, but in actuality the concert was so awesome that the real insanity level was much lower.</p>
<p><em>Note to Becky, my Mom, etc: Yes, this really just means that I am a huge nerd. Not exactly a revelation. :-)</em></p>

			 <p>Having been <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2008/02/07/another-fun-meme-yay-memes/">tagged by Jeff</a> for the latest interweb meme to filter around to these parts, I suppose I should play along.</p>
<p>The Rules: (1) Link to the person that tagged you. (2) Post the rules on your blog. (3) Share six non-important things/habits/quirks about yourself. (4) Tag six random people at the end of your post by linking to their blogs. (5) Let each random person know they have been tagged by leaving a comment on their website.</p>
<p>So, the six non-important things/habits/quirks about me:</p>
<p><strong>1) The Soundtrack in my Head</strong> Other people talk about having an internal dialog going all the time - I have an internal soundtrack. If I hear some word or phrase or phrasing that trips a memory in my brain, I&rsquo;m likely to start singing the line from the song. (This drives my wife nuts.)</p>
<p><strong>2) I have a propensity for spoofing song lyrics.</strong> Think Weird Al, just less talented, and without the accordion. The fun part is to try to do it on the fly in real time. Sometimes it works. Most of the time I just end up breaking out in hysterical laughter after about five lines.</p>
<p><strong>3) I hate hate HATE asking people for things.</strong> Don&rsquo;t know how this one got started, but I would rather put myself out than ask someone for something, even something that I know they&rsquo;d gladly be willing to do/give. This maybe doesn&rsquo;t belong on this list because it verges toward the important - this can be a real flaw at times that I need to work to correct.</p>
<p><strong>4) I see chord structures.</strong> I don&rsquo;t know of a better way to describe it. If I hear a song, I&rsquo;m working through parsing the chord structure in my head. Usually I assume what key the song is in, and then work it out from there, but if I find out it&rsquo;s actually in a different key, I can easily make the switch. I feel it in some combination of what the chord feels like when played on the piano and when played on the guitar. I will drive myself nuts sometimes if I don&rsquo;t get a song figured out right away. I remember sitting in the parking lot at a Subway waiting for Becky to get a sandwich and trying to work out Simon &amp; Garfunkel&rsquo;s <em>Mrs. Robinson</em>. I was so proud when I finally got it.</p>
<p><strong>5) I go to the same restaurants and order the same things every single time.</strong> I hate trying new places. Once I find a place and a dish that I like, I will order the same thing every time. This goes so far as to extend to business trips; last fall I traveled to Oklahoma City for two days and once I found a movie theater and restaurant nearby that I liked, I hit them both two nights in a row&hellip;. it&rsquo;s just easier than having to try something new.</p>
<p><strong>6) I have a huge memory for music and lyrics&hellip; but my repertoire is limited.</strong> Yeah, if I were on that <em>Don&rsquo;t Forget The Lyrics</em> show I would fail miserably&hellip; unless they limited themselves to CCM from the 1990&rsquo;s and indie-Christian-folk-rock from the 2000&rsquo;s. I somehow missed all of the other stuff growing up and have been trying to fill in holes as I go along. You know, in some areas I didn&rsquo;t miss much at all, but I wish I would&rsquo;ve found U2 a lot earlier on. :-)</p>
<p>Now, then&hellip; who to tag?</p>
<p><a href="http://raewhitlock.com">Rae Whitlock</a> <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Daniel D</a> <a href="http://mrsxb.blogspot.com/">Bridget</a> <a href="http://www.qwertyuppy.com">Roger</a> <a href="http://loverbyblood.wordpress.com">TK</a> <a href="http://constancy.blogspot.com/">Nate</a></p>

			 <p>The lengths I will go to hear a concert? Well, this weekend the length was 300 miles, each way. Lincoln, Nebraska ends up being, with short stops, about a five-hour drive. Well worth it to see Caedmon&rsquo;s Call in concert again. First I should extend thanks to my mom for coming down to watch the girls for a couple of days. They had lots and lots of fun with Grandma, and it was sure a blessing for Becky and I to be able to get away.</p>
<p>Three hundred miles to Lincoln on Friday morning was broken up with P. F. Chang&rsquo;s for lunch in Des Moines. It ended up being a good thing we ate a big lunch, because we never did get supper eaten, unless you count the McDonalds cheeseburgers we picked up from the drive thru around 11 pm while on our way to see Andy Osenga&rsquo;s post-show set. After checking into our motel (very decent for the price), we headed down to the church where they were playing to hang out, take pictures, and watch the sound check. Everything was running late enough that once sound check was over it was almost time for the doors to open&hellip; so we ended up just staying there the whole night. Between Derek Webb, Caedmon&rsquo;s, and Andy Osenga, the concert went a full three hours. Lots of fun. I&rsquo;ve written up <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2008/02/09/lincoln-ne-2-8-2008-concert-wrap-up/">a full review with pictures</a> over on caedmonscall.net.</p>
<p>After the Caedmon&rsquo;s show, we trekked over a couple miles to Grace Chapel (a little PCA church in a neat old church building) where Andy Osenga did another half-dozen solo songs. It was fully midnight by the time that was over, and then we were headed back to the other side of Lincoln to our hotel. What a day.</p>
<p>The drive back home was rather uneventful, unless you count seeing multiple cars sliding off the road (not already in the ditch, but actually actively sliding <em>into</em> the ditch) as eventful. Made it home in one piece. Took most of Sunday to catch up on rest. In the end we drove about 750 miles for the weekend. Now, I&rsquo;ve driven further to see concerts, and have seen better concerts, but overall it was great to hear Caedmon&rsquo;s again, to be able to take Becky along (her first Caedmon&rsquo;s show!) and to have a weekend out.</p>

			 <p>This past weekend I had the pleasure of leading music both at <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi</a> on Saturday night and at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a> on Sunday morning. It was the first time in a month that I&rsquo;ve been to Noelridge, and with a month of Imago under our belts it was a good chance to draw some comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>Look and Feel</strong> At Imago we&rsquo;re meeting at night in a 100-year-old sanctuary with lots of stained glass and insufficient lighting. At Noelridge we&rsquo;re meeting on Sunday morning in a smaller 50-year-old sanctuary. Noelridge has a smaller, intimate, friendly feel to it; Imago has a deeper, more awe-inspiring feel. I think I prefer the relative expanse of Imago. We do need to do something about the lighting, though. (Plans are in process.)</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> OK, the music was basically the same. At Imago I led on an electric keyboard with Dave playing guitar behind me. At Noelridge I led from a baby grand with another Dave playing bass and Tapuwa on the congas. I&rsquo;m much more comfortable sitting down leading at the piano rather than standing up - partly I need a mic stand with a longer boom so I can situate the stand better; partly I&rsquo;ve just mostly led while sitting down, and it&rsquo;s a bit of an adjustment to stand up. Both congregations knew the songs pretty well. There was a bunch of sound generated by each congregation with the singing. I am struck, though, by how much more live the sanctuary at Imago is. Hardwood floors and a big high ceiling let the sound rattle around in a way that creates some presence. Noelridge with its low ceilings and carpet is dead by comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Preaching</strong> Same pastor, same sermon, pretty much. I don&rsquo;t have recordings of either of them, and I was semi-distracted during the Imago service during the sermon (trying to decide what song to sing for a closing meditation), so I&rsquo;m going on middling memories here. The Imago version was more concise and seemed targeted a bit more toward unbelievers in the audience. At Noelridge it went kind of long (which seemed OK, though). Still, quality stuff from John 1 both times.</p>
<p><strong>Attitude</strong> This is where there are two very distinct feelings between the two churches. At Imago, since we&rsquo;re so new, everyone seems focused on finding the visitors/new people, greeting them, pulling them in. At Noelridge we have an established congregation, so it&rsquo;s much more of a family feel - people have established relationships, and it shows. Noelridge is still very friendly to visitors, but it&rsquo;s a slightly different feel. What I gather from this is that we at Imago really need to work on developing relationships among the core team and volunteers, getting us feeling more like a warm family and less like a band of volunteers.</p>
<p>Conclusions? There are good things going on both places. We both have work to do. We both have things we can learn. In both, the gospel is proclaimed, and so I rejoice.</p>

<li>Playing basketball three times a week is good for your game and your weight, but sure does make you sore.</li>
<li>Hard to believe it&rsquo;s almost February already. Next weekend: trip to Lincoln, NE to see Caedmon&rsquo;s Call and Andy O.</li>
<li>Five-hour road trip to see said musicians: seems relatively short. Oh, and Mom is coming down to watch the girls so Becky and I get a couple days out to ourselves!</li>
<li>Doing double-duty this weekend - leading at both <a href="http://imagochristicp.org">Imago</a> and <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve registered a domain name to hang out a shingle for web design services. Don&rsquo;t know how much business I&rsquo;ll manage to drum up, but after doing so many freebie websites for friends over the past several years, it&rsquo;s fun to think that I could actually get paid for it instead.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tweet140.com/user/cjhubbs/">Tweet140</a> mocks me even as I&rsquo;m writing this post.</li>
<li>Haven&rsquo;t traveled for work yet this year but that&rsquo;s gonna change soon - there&rsquo;s the threat of a last-minute trip to Seattle in mid-February, and a scheduled trip to Augusta, GA in early March.</li>
<li>I think I might actually only finish two books in January, which is a real low for me. It&rsquo;s not that I haven&rsquo;t been reading - it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ve been reading a long, thick book that has to be read slowly.</li>

			 <p>It took me a while to get around to it, but last night Becky and I finally sat down to watch <em>Once</em>. I had a hard time finding it at the video store - I think they only stock maybe two copies on DVD. But it was worth the search.</p>
<p>Never heard of <em>Once</em>? It&rsquo;s a rather obscure Irish film made back in 2006 for something less than $10,000. It&rsquo;s a story about a guy who writes songs, who meets a girl on the street one day. She, too, is a musician, and over the course of a week they write and record several songs and along the way wrestle with ideas of love, commitment, family, and responsibility. It&rsquo;s a musical of a sort; you get to hear seven or eight full-length songs sung during the movie, but they&rsquo;re not in <em>The Sound of Music</em>-style musical narration - rather, they&rsquo;re acoustic folk/rock songs (think Damien Rice for a comparison) that the pair is writing. And while the film started off obscure, don&rsquo;t expect it to stay that way. It&rsquo;s garnered quite an obsessive following due not in the least to the fantastic soundtrack. Oh, and that award from the Sundance film festival and that Oscar nomination won&rsquo;t hurt it, either.</p>
<p>So why does this film work so well?</p>
<p>First, the actors aren&rsquo;t experienced actors - the male lead (Glen Hansard of the Irish band The Frames) has only been in one picture before this, and this is the female lead (Marketa Irglova)&rsquo;s first film. But they are musicians, and in my experience films about musicians that actually star musicians seem to do better. The fact that Hansard and Irglova teamed up to write all the original music for the movie amazes me even more.</p>
<p>Second, the story is real. We can all repeat the cliched chick-flick plot basically in our sleep, right? There&rsquo;s the guy, and the girl, and her friend, and his friend. There&rsquo;s the initial meeting, the I-think-I-love-you scene, the crisis where everything looks lost, and then the glowing finale. When you watch <em>Once</em>, forget the cliches. The guy writes songs which he sings on the streetcorner. He moved back in with his dad after his mom died and works at the family business fixing vacuum cleaners. She&rsquo;s a Czech immigrant who cleans houses, and, without revealing too much, has family entanglements as well. They meet. They interact. They wrestle with their feelings. It feels right.</p>
<p>And the music is so good. The headline song (<em>Falling Slowly</em>) is nominated for an Oscar and certainly should be the favorite. The rest of the soundtrack is nearly equal in quality. The songs will stand by themselves even if you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie&hellip; but watch the movie. It got an R-rating because of the Irish predilection of casually using the F-bomb as an adjective and interjection. Even that, though, is pretty much limited to a couple of scenes. The film as a whole, though, is a beautiful, beautiful work of art. You can have your Hollywood blockbusters. I&rsquo;ll take this little Irish gem any day.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;&hellip;and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.&rdquo; (2 Tim 2:2)</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s wise counsel to Timothy is applicable on many levels, and has a multitude of benefits. A few that I will mention today:</p>
<p><strong>It about the message, not the messenger.</strong> Paul was a good example of this, not being jealous of others who gained renown preaching the gospel, but rather simply rejoicing that the gospel was proclaimed. Pride will tempt us to want to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; - the teacher and leader that people remember and look to. But what is of primary importance isn&rsquo;t us, but is the gospel that gets preached. When we practice entrusting to faithful men, we are shedding a few of the (multitudinous) opportunities for pride.</p>
<p><strong>The message must carry on after us.</strong> Paul himself knew that his days on the earth were short. To have his most effective ministry, he needed not only to preach to unbelievers, but also to teach the teachers who would reach the following generation. I have heard it said that your effectiveness as a parent isn&rsquo;t shown as much in how your children turn out as in how your grandchildren turn out. For Paul&rsquo;s spiritual grandchildren to be vibrant and mature Christians, he needed to make sure his spiritual children were well-trained.</p>
<p><strong>You can&rsquo;t do it all on your own.</strong> This is the big temptation for me, and was the initial thought that prompted this post. Just because you (or I) have the skills to do the task yourself doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be the one to always do it. There is far more work to do than any one of us can handle. Finding and training others who can both assist and replace you is essential in maintaining health, sanity, and the healthy operation of any ministry.</p>

			 <p>Pretty much ever since my brother Andrew and his fiancee Heather set a date for the wedding this summer Becky has been in full-on planning mode for the trip. It&rsquo;ll be a bit of an adventure and all, taking the girls on their first airplane ride and going cross-country to Washington for a week. We&rsquo;re going to make a week-long vacation out of it; we&rsquo;ll have a few days with the family for the wedding, but we want to get out to see the ocean, too, and will try to take a day to see Seattle and hopefully Matt (my old college roommate) and his wife Abbie.</p>
<p>So when I say full-on planning mode, well, that doesn&rsquo;t capture the half of it. Becky is a ridiculous crazy good planner. She first scoped out the airfares and after a few days settled on the best option of price, schedule, and dates. With that in place, she sketched out an itinerary for the 8 days of the trip - fly in, go to the ocean, then head up towards the wedding, then hit Seattle for a couple days on the way out. With that planned, she started researching places to stay near the ocean. If she could find true Oceanfront, she&rsquo;d be thrilled. [There is a point to this story, just be patient.]</p>
<p>She found a place called the <a href="http://www.lighthouseresort.net">Oceanfront Lighthouse Resort</a> that has some pretty nice &ldquo;oceanfront&rdquo; condos, at least as far as we could tell from the website. The website is pretty scary - obviously someone&rsquo;s side project, just enough to make do. Then inspiration struck - why, I asked Becky, don&rsquo;t I contact the resort and see if they&rsquo;d like to trade a website overhaul for a couple nights' stay? A few emails later I had agreed to create a prototype so that they could make a decision. Half-a-dozen hours of weekend webdesign later I had <a href="http://thehubbs.net/lho/">a prototype</a> complete and emailed off. (And <a href="http://www.gfmorris.net">Geof</a>: thanks for allowing shell access. Makes it a <em>ton</em> easier to edit stuff live.)</p>
<p>Last night I talked on the phone with the manager of the resort for a while. The end result: we now have reservations for a complimentary two-night stay in <a href="http://www.lighthouseresort.net/203.htm">an oceanfront condo</a>. And I have probably another 5 or 6 hours of work to complete and setup the new website. Sure, if I were a professional designer I&rsquo;d get a better hourly rate, but for a couple afternoons of design work, well, I&rsquo;ll do the trade.</p>
<p>If I design too many more websites I need to think about setting up a design homepage to see if I can attract a little more business. After doing so many (worthy) freebies, these paying gigs are kinda fun!</p>

			 <p>If there was ever a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; album to come out of the (largely mediocre) world of CCM, Rich Mullins' <em>A Liturgy, a Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band</em> was it. (Are the &lsquo;A&rsquo;s supposed to be capitalized? It looks funny either way.) This album is fifteen (fifteen!) years old this year, and yet still sounds as fresh and vital as when it was released. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the album, let me give you an overview. (If you <em>are</em> familiar with the album, you won&rsquo;t mind the refresher at all.)</p>
<p>Split into two halves, the first half is the splendid Liturgy. <em>Here In America</em> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introit"><em>Introit</em></a>, or entrance. It is followed by the stunning text of (Isaiah) <em>52:10</em>, the hymn of praise recognizing the beauty of creation called <em>The Color Green</em>, the supplicant&rsquo;s prayer <em>Hold Me Jesus</em>, the bold restatement of the (Apostle&rsquo;s) <em>Creed</em>, and <em>Peace</em>, helpfully subtitled <em>A Communion Blessing from St. Joseph&rsquo;s Square</em>. Each song in itself is excellent, and as a set they reach the level of masterpiece. When, in <em>Peace</em>, Rich starts the first two verses with this juxtaposition</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though we&rsquo;re strangers, still I love you<br>
I love you more than your mask<br>
And you know you have to trust this to be true<br>
And I know that&rsquo;s much to ask&hellip;
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And though I love you, still we&rsquo;re strangers<br>
Prisoners in these lonely hearts<br>
And though our blindness separates us<br>
Still a light shines in the dark&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We understand immediately the tension of the Christian fellowship - bound by the love of Christ, and yet so frustratingly driven apart by our sinful humanity. It&rsquo;s beautiful stuff from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The second half is the Legacy: a reflection on life. It starts with the upbeat instrumental <em>78 Eatonwood Green</em>, then moves into the challenge of being like Jesus (<em>Hard</em>), the challenge of living life away from family (<em>I&rsquo;ll Carry On</em>), a child&rsquo;s wonder at Christmas (<em>You Gotta Get Up</em>), the challenge and frustration of the world we live in (Mark Heard&rsquo;s <em>How To Grow Up Big and Strong</em>), and finally the most beautiful picture you&rsquo;ll ever hear painted of the tension of living in a country you love while simultaneously looking forward to the heavenly home (<em>Land of my Sojurn</em>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody tells you when you get born here<br>
How much you&rsquo;re going to love it and how you&rsquo;ll never belong here<br>
So I&rsquo;ll call you my country, but I&rsquo;ll be longing for my home<br>
And I wish that I could take you there with me&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Ragamuffin Band? Well, they sound fantastic. From Rich&rsquo;s clear piano and the cymbals mirroring the ocean&rsquo;s crashing in <em>Here In America</em>, to the mellow electric guitar and <em>fantastic</em> drum fills in <em>Peace</em>, to the dulcimer driving <em>Land of my Sojurn</em>, the album has an organic acoustic sound that rightfully has become the inspiration for a younger generation of musicians. My first inclination is to say that it is lightning in a bottle, that it&rsquo;ll never be captured that way again. But then I listen to the guitars of <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a>, the piano of <a href="http://www.benshive.com">Ben Shive</a>, and the percussion of <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Todd Bragg and Garrett Buell</a>, and I will instead be thankful that the musical and songwriting heritage of Rich Mullins has indeed carried on.</p>

			 <p>My mom has mentioned more than once how she enjoys seeing our girls' personalities as they get bigger and start to really develop. She sees Laura as having more of my personality: quiet, methodical, the classic introverted engineer. (Poor kid!) Addie, on the other hand, is the more ornery outgoing one, much like my brother Ryan. I knew I more or less agreed with Mom, but saw it very clearly last night.</p>
<p>We showed up at church around 5 pm to get ready for Wednesday night dinner (which we were serving). The daycare kids who occupy our basement after school were just getting ready to leave. Of course Laura and Addie wanted to play with them, and for a few minutes both of them did. But it was only a couple minutes later that Laura started feeling overwhelmed by the group of noisy kids, and she retreated into the kitchen with us. She was much happier just hanging out there where it was quiet.</p>
<p>But Addie? She was wearing a necklace of gold plastic beads that she got from a parade this summer; it has a big gold plastic disc pendant that advertises a local bank. Since the kids didn&rsquo;t know her name, they saw the bling and started calling her &ldquo;hip-hop baby&rdquo;. She spent the next 10+ minutes chasing them around, teasing them, ducking into the kitchen where they weren&rsquo;t allowed, only to then poke her head out, get them to scream, chase after them a bit&hellip; All the more hilarious because she&rsquo;s not yet 2 and they were all between 8 and 10.</p>
<p>Parenting is so much fun.</p>

			 <p>Weekends are going to look a little bit different now that we&rsquo;re having church on Saturday night. Something to get used to. This weekend was actually pretty great; a phone call from my sister saying &ldquo;hey, we&rsquo;re bored, can we come visit this afternoon?&rdquo; changed our direction pretty quickly. So the folks and Rebecca came down in time for church on Saturday night and then hung around on Sunday until late afternoon. It was great to see them and hang out.</p>
<p>Saturday night went well down at Imago Christi - certainly better than the first week. Sermon was tighter, music was more together, adding Dave Paris on the guitar with the worship team was a big plus. Picking a song for the meditation after the sermon continues to be a challenge - it&rsquo;s just hard to know what the right song will be until I hear the message. Saturday night I wanted to use the song &ldquo;Jesus, Name above all Names&rdquo;, but the 70&rsquo;s style of the original song was turning me off to it. So for the last five minutes of the sermon I worked out a new tune in my head, and then sang it. It actually sounded pretty good. I should go write it down while I still remember it. :-)</p>
<p>Watched a bunch of football yesterday and was surprised and disappointed to see the Colts lose to the Chargers; not so surprised or disappointed to see the Cowboys lose. I&rsquo;m gonna have to cheer for the Packers from here on out. There has to be <em>somebody</em> who can beat the Patriots.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s your weekend update from Iowa. It&rsquo;s now Monday morning and there&rsquo;s work to be done.</p>

<li>Just realized I never gave you all any feedback on the first service at Imago Christi. It went pretty well - had 60 in attendance. Music was OK, though I starting singing the wrong verse of one hymn at one point, which threw everybody off. :-(</li>
<li>Just started my new book list for 2008. You can find the link on the sidebar. Only one book on it so far.</li>
<li>I have resolved to not get any more books from the library until I read through the pile that&rsquo;s next to my bed. It has grown to where it won&rsquo;t fit under the lip of the bedside table any more - must be 15 books there. They&rsquo;re good things that I want to read, I just keep preempting them with newer stuff from the library. Gotta whittle that pile down.</li>
<li>Just heard that Andrew Peterson will be doing a concert in Cedar Rapids the day after my birthday. Happy Birthday to me! Hey Andrew and Heather, when will you be back in the area for spring break? Want to come down to CR?</li>
<li>Speaking of Andrew and Heather, we&rsquo;ve been plotting (well, Becky&rsquo;s been plotting) our trip to WA this summer for the wedding. It&rsquo;s looking like fun.</li>
<li>Next note on the wedding: I&rsquo;m gonna have to buy a suit. I haven&rsquo;t owned a suit in years. The blazer I wore during college hasn&rsquo;t fit me through the shoulders since probably 2000.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s harder than it should be to remember that the Saturday night service at Imago wasn&rsquo;t a one-time event. I&rsquo;ve got to plan music for this Saturday&hellip; should do that today.</li>

			 <p>The biggest adjustment this week in preparing for the Saturday night service is starting to think of it as a weekly routine. We&rsquo;ve done other one-time events down there in the past, and it would be quite easy to think of last Saturday&rsquo;s service as just another one-time event. Except that it&rsquo;s not - I need to get music planned, get the worship team lined up and ready to go, get the lyrics prepared for the bulletin, all the usual tasks&hellip; again this week.</p>
<p>One thing I think would help in this regard is setting a regular schedule throughout the week for my planning and preparation. Something like this:</p>
<p>Saturday night: worship service.</p>
<p>Sunday: prepare sermon recording for website, listen to it again and evaluate.</p>
<p>Monday: make sure the website is updated for the week.</p>
<p>Tuesday: choose music for the following week and email to worship team.</p>
<p>Thursday: prepare bulletin.</p>
<p>Saturday: practice with the WT and do the service.</p>
<p>Repeat.</p>
<p>I think it might work. However it happens, I sure need a routine.</p>

			 <p>Saturday was the big day - first service at <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi</a>! A timeline of the day:</p>
<p><strong>7:30 am:</strong> Wake up after sleeping in. Feels good. Making mental lists of what I need to remember for the service.</p>
<p><strong>9:45 am:</strong> Everyone is fed and dressed. Making a couple final tweaks to the bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>9:55 am:</strong> Headed to Noelridge to print the bulletin and pick up the drums.</p>
<p><strong>10:30 am:</strong> Setting out 2008 giving envelopes for Noelridge while the bulletins print.</p>
<p><strong>10:50 am:</strong> Loading congas, microphones, mic stands, and a small podium into the van.</p>
<p><strong>12:10 pm:</strong> Girls are taking a nap, Becky and I are watching Heroes. Almost done with Season One.</p>
<p><strong>12:30 pm:</strong> Nate calls and wants to know when we can meet so he can drop off the sound equipment. Any time before 3:30 will work for him.</p>
<p><strong>1:15 pm:</strong> Meet Nate at Imago. Set up speakers, amp, adjust the EQ.</p>
<p><strong>1:45 pm:</strong> Heading back home.</p>
<p><strong>3:15 pm:</strong> Leaving to pick up Andre and head to Imago for worship team practice.</p>
<p><strong>3:30 pm:</strong> Made it to Imago, setting up microphones and the keyboard. How will we arrange all this stuff on the stage?</p>
<p><strong>4:00 pm:</strong> Finally ready to practice the music. Getting a nasty hum from the passive pickup in Morgan&rsquo;s guitar.</p>
<p><strong>5:00 pm:</strong> We&rsquo;re as practiced as we&rsquo;re going to be. Plugging in the iPod. Andrew Peterson will provide background music until the service starts.</p>
<p><strong>5:15 pm:</strong> Changing into my <a href="http://ilikeandy.com">ilikeandy.com</a> t-shirt and a jacket.</p>
<p><strong>5:30 pm:</strong> Service starting. Must be about 50 people here.</p>
<p><strong>5:35 pm:</strong> We&rsquo;re up. Music starts. People are clapping on the first song. Woohoo!</p>
<p><strong>5:39 pm:</strong> This second song is a mess. Timing is off, and I messed up the lyrics to the second verse. Not my A game. Grrrr.</p>
<p><strong>5:50 pm:</strong> Music set is done. Still pondering what song to use as the musical meditation at the end of the service.</p>
<p><strong>6:40 pm:</strong> Richard has finally wrapped up the sermon. Taking mental notes to give him a review later. I&rsquo;ve decided on a song.</p>
<p><strong>6:50 pm:</strong> First service is over, and we survived. Thank God. Heading down for a fellowship time.</p>
<p><strong>7:15 pm:</strong> Tearing down sound equipment. Fortunately we have a closet where we can store it there at the church.</p>
<p><strong>7:45 pm:</strong> Everything is torn down and put away. Now to lug those congas back out to the car so we can use &lsquo;em at Noelridge in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>8:10 pm:</strong> Home. Exhausted. Putting the girls to bed.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 pm:</strong> Watching the last three episodes of Season One of Heroes. Pretty good ending.</p>

I think we&rsquo;re to the point where we&rsquo;ve planned about as much as we can; now we just have to go for it and trust God to see us through. This is the point where the butterflies set in.</p>
<p>Pray for us today that we would be effective, and above all else, that God would be glorified.</p>

			 <p>One year ago I decided that my blog was the must useful place to keep my reading list, and that proved to be a good choice. I&rsquo;ve tried keeping reading lists in the past, but was never consistent in recording. This year, though, I managed to record each book and a couple sentences of synopsis and review. I don&rsquo;t do much in the way of Top 10 lists, but this seems like one place where I have enough data at hand to make a year-end summary. So here goes.</p>
<p>Total books read: 85. Total fiction: 68. Total non-fiction: 17. Total re-reads: 1.</p>
<p>The one notable series for this year was Harry Potter. I managed to resist the series until this year, but finally decided it was time to give them a try. I was glad I did; they were some very entertaining reads. I started Book 1 on July 11 and finished Book 7 on August 23, and managed to sneak six other books in during that six weeks as well!</p>
<p>A look at my non-fiction stuff betrays my interest in history and science, with a dabbling in music. No real surprises, I guess.</p>
<p>My Top 5 non-fiction reads of the year, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0486460363%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0486460363%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">The Everlasting Man</a> - G. K. Chesterton. This is a classic, took me a while to read, but Chesterton is worth it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0743270754%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0743270754%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</a> - Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin makes history interesting. Very readable, interesting insights into an amazing man.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0307339386%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0307339386%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Chosen Soldier: The Making of a Special Forces Warrior</a> - Dick Couch. I&rsquo;m a sucker for special forces/military stuff anyway, and this is an excellent look at what the Army Special Forces folks do.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0684804484%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0684804484%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II</a> - Doris Kearns Goodwin. Got started on DKG, read a second book. Good stuff once again.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0802716210%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0802716210%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">A More Perfect Constitution: 23 Proposals to Revitalize Our Constitution and Make America a Fairer Country</a> - Larry J. Sabato. Some very interesting ideas here, including changing the number of senators/representatives and the lengths of their term, a proposal for a single six-year (extendable to eight-year via national referendum) term for president, and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>My top 8 fiction reads, again in no particular order (I was going to list 10, but couldn&rsquo;t find two more that lived up to the standards of these 8):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765351684%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765351684%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Variable Star</a> - Robert Heinlein &amp; Spider Robinson. The title character goes on a &ldquo;galactic bender&rdquo;&hellip; yeah, and it&rsquo;s a great story.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765354535%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765354535%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Sun of Suns (Virga, Book 1)</a> - Karl Schroeder. Schroeder manages to create a very believable, imaginative world for his story. I&rsquo;ve got book 2 sitting in my to-read pile right now. Can&rsquo;t wait.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0765313553%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0765313553%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">In War Times</a> - Kathleen Ann Goonan. Goonan combines time travel, jazz, and World War II in a way that blows my mind. Easily my favorite non-series book of the year.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0618894640%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0618894640%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">The Children of Húrin</a> - J.

Card has a gift for storytelling and imagination. This novel weaves some of the plot and ideas of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em> into a delightful modern fantasy.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0545010225%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0545010225%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Book 7)</a> - J. K. Rowling. I promised myself I&rsquo;d only include one HP book in this list, and it had to be this one. It caps off the series brilliantly.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1560259817%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1560259817%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Overclocked: Stories of the Future Present</a> - Cory Doctorow. Most of the sci-fi short stories I&rsquo;ve read up to this point have been older; it&rsquo;s fun to read something written recently - the current-ness of the technology and ideas makes them even more believable and frightening.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0307387895%26tag=scifirev-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0307387895%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">The Road</a> - Cormac McCarthy. No, I didn&rsquo;t read this one because Oprah recommended it. <a href="http://www.rabbitroom.com/?p=332">Andrew Peterson recommended it, too!</a> :-) Chilling, spare, and yet ultimately hopeful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently I am a sci-fi nerd. It&rsquo;s not that all I read is sci-fi&hellip; I guess those just stick out the most to me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start a new list for 2008 once I finish my first book. Gotta see how my reading preferences change from year to year.</p>

			 <p>Alex Strauch provides some practical guidance for becoming a church that truly cares for people (from the Summer 2007 edition of <a href="http://www.emmaus.edu">Emmaus Bible College&rsquo;s</a> <em>Journey</em> magazine):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize a Benevolence Fund.</strong> Caring for the poor and needy cannot be done in a willy-nilly fashion&hellip; it&rsquo;s amazing when we put our money together what we can do!</li>
<li><strong>Establish a Father Program.</strong> Many children in our churches today come without a father&hellip; over the years my four daughters would bring children, mainly girls, from school to the table to eat with us. For many of these girls it was the first time they were at a table with the father present.</li>
<li><strong>Provide language training for new immigrants.</strong> A number of our women had professional training and detrees in TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language), and they said we should do this. We were wondering, &ldquo;Where are these people going to come from? We haven&rsquo;t seen any immigrants in the neighborhood.&rdquo; Nevertheless, we put up a sign reading &ldquo;English as a Second Language.&rdquo; Within one day we filled the whole program.</li>
<li><strong>Provide hospitality to poor and needy members.</strong> People love it when they come to your table for a meal. And the Lord Jesus instructs His people to invite certain kinds of people for a meal: &ldquo;the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind&rdquo; (Luke 14:13).</li>
<li><strong>Provide the poor with cars, furniture, and household goods.</strong> How often we&rsquo;re getting rid of a car, selling a car. Don&rsquo;t sell it - give it to someone!</li>
<li><strong>Raise awareness of poverty both local and global.</strong> Even if your assembly is middle class or upper middle class, there are bound to be people who are suffering financially. But you must have your eyes open to see it.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledge the reality of the AIDS epidemic.</strong> One of the greatest tragedies in world history is right here before us&hellip;</li>
<li><strong>Leaders must set a vision before the congregation.</strong> We need to set a vision before our people that pulls us out of our self-centeredness. Our people need to be stirred to a compassionate care for our congregation, and a compassionate awareness of a world situation that is almost unspeakable.</li>

			 <p><a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org">Imago Christi</a>&rsquo;s inaugural service is just over a week away - January 5, 2008. <a href="/07/12/selecting-music-for-an-inaugural-service/">As I noted previously</a>, it&rsquo;s a bit of a challenge to pick the music - something appropriate for the first service of a new church, setting the tone for services to come, and having something accessible for those who are coming who may not be familiar with the songs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve settled on these four:</p>
<p>Blessed Be The Name of the Lord (Clinton Utterbach)<br>
Praise to the Lord, The Almighty<br>
My All In All (Dennis Jernigan)<br>
Jesus, I Come (with new tune from RUF Hymnal)</p>
<p>I think this keeps things relatively simple, yet incorporates some new and old lyrics of praise of the Father, praise of the Son as the Lamb of God, and a beautiful expression of the Gospel in the final hymn. I pray it will be a blessing to those who attend.</p>

			 <p>What a great Christmas, and now how good to be home. We spent several days at my parents' place in Wisconsin, though for the first day or so they weren&rsquo;t there&hellip; they had to go to Chicago to pick up my sister, who flew in from Panama, and my brother, who flew in from DC. They made it within about 30 miles of home before the snow storm got so intense that they couldn&rsquo;t manage to get any further. So they got a room, stayed the night, and waited for the snow plows. By noon the next day they made it home. It was sure good to see everyone.</p>
<p>Christmas was a marvelous time. It&rsquo;s always such fun with small children, and Laura and Addie just loved opening their presents and playing with their new toys. The carnage comes when we bring them all home and add them to the existing pile of toys. I think it&rsquo;s time for a garage sale or a large donation to Goodwill.</p>
<p>We did manage to get at least one decent family picture taken, so here we wish you a belated Merry Christmas! (For family and friends: I&rsquo;ll get a bunch more uploaded to Flickr sometime this week.)</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re going to have our first worship team practice for Imago tonight, which means I need to have music selected for our first service. Selecting church music is normally a bit of a challenge, but selecting music to kick off a whole new church? Intimidating. I&rsquo;ll need to pick a mix of old hymns and some more modern stuff; I&rsquo;m thinking of some Chris Tomlin and maybe Praise to the Lord, the Almighty. Any ideas? Feel free to leave them in the comments. I&rsquo;ll post the list when I get it finalized.</p>

			 <p>Today is my last work day for the year. Thanks to a day of vacation tomorrow and a generous holiday schedule from my employer, I will be able to enjoy the better part of two weeks away from the office. Not that it&rsquo;ll be slow during that time&hellip; we leave Saturday to visit my family in Wisconsin. It will be so good to have everyone back together&hellip; Rebecca gets back from Panama on Saturday. Oh, and I&rsquo;m also very ready to be allowed to dig into the massive pile of cookies that Becky has been making over the past couple of weeks. I think her goal this year was to make so many cookies that she could take them up to my family&rsquo;s place and still have cookies left at the end of the visit. I&rsquo;ll bet she achieved it.</p>
<p>Lots of other blogs do Top 10 lists at the end of the year, proclaiming their best new albums or movies or books or the like. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be doing that here. First of all, I doubt I&rsquo;ve bought 10 CDs all year. And I haven&rsquo;t watched too many movies, either. I may do a book roundup, though - I&rsquo;m probably gonna be over 80 books for the year, maybe I can do a retrospective.</p>
<p>After reading the above two paragraphs, I&rsquo;m amazed that content like this keeps anyone coming back to this blog. :-) Thanks for reading, and Merry Christmas.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>One of my big initial tasks for Imago Christi is to figure out the worship team situation. Music is going to be an important part of our church &ldquo;feel&rdquo;. I had to select a word carefully there. Music won&rsquo;t be the most important part of the church, not by a long shot. Nor will it be the most important part of the worship service. But music sets the tone, the &ldquo;feel&rdquo;, for the service and the congregation. Our music at Imago needs to draw from both ancient and modern, to be current musically while capturing the richness of two millenia of church tradition, wisdom, and teaching.</p>
<p>With that mental framework in place I start to look for musicians and vocalists. In the end I picture a small band; drums, a guitar or two, keyboard, bass, and a few vocals. But we&rsquo;ll start smaller than that. It looks like our inaugural service will be keys, (conga) drums, and maybe an acoustic guitar. Three of us on vocals. We&rsquo;ll see where it goes from there. I&rsquo;m a lousy recruiter. I hate asking people to do things. I want people who are self-motivated and <em>want</em> to participate on the team. When God brings them, we&rsquo;ll add them in. Am I being naive about this?</p>
<p>First practice is Thursday night. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was reading Psalm 131 this morning and was struck by the picture of contentment painted in its three short verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With two small girls at our house, this picture is a familiar one. When Laura snuggles up on my wife&rsquo;s lap, she is the picture of contentment. She&rsquo;s not worried about things &ldquo;too great and marvelous&rdquo; - she just wants to rest and to feel the love of her mother. She is secure in the arms of one who she knows loves her, will care for her, and will keep her safe. So she sits quietly, peaceful in the knowledge that she&rsquo;s in good hands, and content.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s people our hope and contentment is in the Lord. He can handle the great and marvelous things. I want to focus on resting in Him and trusting His goodness today.</p>

			 <p><a href="/07/12/christmas-shopping-complete-in-record-time/">Christmas shopping is complete.</a> The <a href="http://www.imagochristicp.org/2007/11/19/cocoa-and-carols-december-15/">Christmas program</a> is over. We&rsquo;ve received a bunch of Christmas cards already. We still haven&rsquo;t gotten any sent. Apologies in advance to organized friends like Stephanie and the Hollands. It&rsquo;s not that we don&rsquo;t appreciate you thinking of us and sending us the pictures. We do, really. We&rsquo;re just not organized enough to get our own sent out this year. When I was growing up it was the family joke that we would send out a New Year&rsquo;s letter, because our Christmas letter always went out really late. I think this Hubbs household might have to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Tasks for this week: baking cookies. Well, that&rsquo;s mostly Becky. She has baked so many cookies this last week already. Toll House cookies. Chocolate Espresso cookies. O&rsquo;Henry bars. Chocolate chip cookie dough balls. I know the Chex Mix is coming up yet this week. She has a schedule for every day divided up into morning, afternoon, and evening, with baking tasks laid out appropriately so that she can finish before we head to Wisconsin on Saturday. I am impressed, as usual, with her organizational determination.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/2110109190_d7e2a2a475_t.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Other tasks for this week: Wrapping presents. Just because they&rsquo;re all bought doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re ready for Christmas. We&rsquo;ll load up the coffee table downstairs with all the wrapping implements and then turn something on the TV. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;ll be more Heroes. I never watched Heroes when it started last year on TV, and once I got behind, I knew it was no use trying to start in the middle. So I got Season 1 and we&rsquo;ve been saving it until we had time. Now with the writer&rsquo;s strike and no new shows to watch, it&rsquo;s the perfect time. We watched five episodes over the weekend. Totally hooked. If not Heroes, it&rsquo;ll be time to break out the Muppet Christmas Carol. It is pretty much a yearly tradition - who can fail to love Kermit as Bob Crachit and Michael Caine as Mr. Scrooge? So much fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking Friday off work to get a head start on the holidays. Then we pack and head off to see the family. Lots to do between now and then, though. After all, it&rsquo;s only one more week &lsquo;til Christmas.</p>

Thanks to the wonders of amazon.com and other online retailers, my Christmas shopping has been complete for almost a week now. OK, ignore that one thing I need to pick up for my sister&hellip; but yeah, everything is bought and in the care of US Mail or UPS, making its way to my house in time to be wrapped and transported to Wisconsin for Christmas.</p>
<p>I should really be careful with this - now I&rsquo;ve set my performance bar pretty high for next year! :-)</p>

			 <p>Becky and I were wandering the toy shelves at our local Target store recently, finishing up some Christmas shopping for the girls. On one shelf I saw this little set of dolls:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A couple of thoughts came to mind: first, how quaint! This reminds me of something out of the early 20th century, all nicely culturally stereotyped in ethnic garb. I am surprised that the PC police haven&rsquo;t come down on it. But then I looked a little closer, and noticed this particular doll, which you can still make out even with the fuzzy picture quality from my camera phone:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Notice anything wrong? Yep, the doll is supposed to represent England, but <em>she&rsquo;s wearing Scottish plaid</em>. If I were from England, I&rsquo;d be unhappy. Obviously, somebody from Target (or whoever in China designs their toys) doesn&rsquo;t realize that Scotland /= England. Ah well, a geography lesson for another day.</p>

<li>Finally thinking about Christmas shopping. I think it&rsquo;s gonna be a Amazon year. I have some good book ideas for almost everybody.</li>
<li>Chatted with Ryan for a while yesterday and it&rsquo;s interesting to see us progressing remarkably parallel paths of theological thought and reading. Makes me wonder what it was in our common upbringing that&rsquo;s moving us that way.</li>
<li>In the same chat conversation there were enough ideas come up to give me an outline for one of those books that I&rsquo;d love to write but keep lamenting I never have the time for. I really should make an effort.</li>

			 <p>Dear Delta Airlines,</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t decide whether to be mad with you or not. I was definitely not pleased with a 2.5 hour delay in Cedar Rapids <em>and</em> a missed connection + 1.5 hour delay in Atlanta. But I was happy with how easy it was to get booked onto the later flight, and the first-class seat was nice, given that I had to sit in it for an hour <em>on the ground</em> before we ever took off.</p>
<p>Hoping for better luck on the way home, Chris</p>
<p>Dear National Car Rental,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why my reservation was with you instead of Hertz, but it was really lame that your employee was still there at 1:30 a.m. but told me you were closed and I couldn&rsquo;t get my car.</p>
<p>Hoping to not deal with you again, Chris</p>
<p>Dear Hertz,</p>
<p>Thanks for staying open past your posted 1 a.m. closing time. I wish I could&rsquo;ve gotten a nav system in the car, but the map worked OK.</p>
<p>Your loyal customer, Chris</p>
<p>Dear Hilton Savannah Desoto,</p>
<p>I was so glad you still had my room reserved when I showed up at 2:30 a.m. The bed was comfortable, too, Five hours in it was definitely not long enough. And kudos on the free wi-fi. Here&rsquo;s a hint: if you use the same SSID throughout the building and just vary the channel, it makes it less hassle connecting as I move around the building.</p>
<p>Feeling bad for bringing up such a minor point, Chris</p>

			 <p>So it&rsquo;s been a nice weekend. Ryan decided at the last minute to come visit for the holiday, so we&rsquo;ve enjoyed his company over the long weekend. Watched a lot of football, ate a bunch of tasty food, and now the weekend is over. Still, only a month until Christmas. :-)</p>
<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m waiting for my flight from Cedar Rapids to take me to Atlanta, which in turn will connect to Savannah, GA. This flight was supposed to leave about 3 pm today, but is now looking more like 5:20 pm. I think my connection in Atlanta will be delayed enough that I can make it. I&rsquo;m happy that Atlanta is getting rain and all, but couldn&rsquo;t they have gotten it tomorrow after I&rsquo;m there?!? This is the part of air travel that I so dislike. Ah well.</p>
<p>Tomorrow evening I&rsquo;m planning on meeting a college friend (Daniel Schaffhauser, if that name rings a bell) and his family for some supper and time to visit. Should be a good time. Otherwise, I don&rsquo;t know what Savannah will hold for me, though I&rsquo;ve had a slew of recommendations. So little time to play tourist&hellip; but ya gotta roll with it. What else can you do?</p>

			 <p>Last Wednesday night we left the girls at church (Laura for AWANA, Addie to play in the nursery) and ran a few errands, then arrived back a few minutes early to pick them up. Becky went over to chat with one of her friends, and I, having a few minutes on my hands, wandered into the sanctuary to play the piano.</p>
<p>There are few things I enjoy more than the chance to sit down in a dark, quiet room and play a nice piano. I don&rsquo;t get to do it very often any more. So I sat and improvised a little George Winston-esque jazz, just enjoying the sounds and textures. Occasionally someone would come through the sanctuary, hear the piano, look up, and nod or say hello, but otherwise it was quiet. Then Cubbies got out, and here came the three and four year olds.</p>
<p>I could hear them tearing down the hallway toward the sanctuary. Laura&rsquo;s friends Abigail and Ella got to the door of the sanctuary first, but stopped short as the entered the doorway, saw the room dark, and heard the piano music. They looked up at me to see where it was coming from, then just stood there, not sure what to do, but intimidated by the room and the situation.</p>
<p>Then Laura reached the door. She followed their gaze to the piano, saw me sitting there, and took off at a full run up the aisle to the piano, yelling &ldquo;Daddeeeeeeee!&rdquo; at the top of her lungs. She crashed up to the piano, gave me a hug, and proceeded to show me the picture she&rsquo;d drawn at Cubbies.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve not used this blog to draw lots of devotional illustrations from my children thus far, but this one was so immediately obvious that I just couldn&rsquo;t let it go. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:16;&amp;version=9;">Hebrews 4:16</a> instructs us to &ldquo;&hellip;come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&rdquo; We aren&rsquo;t to fear coming to God with our needs and concerns, quivering at the dark door like some ancient Israelite priest. Instead, we&rsquo;re called to come in boldly, running up the aisle to the One who we know loves us like no one else can. Thanks, Father, for the vivid reminder.</p>

			 <p>I was going to make this part 3, but this all really ties together too much, so let&rsquo;s just talk about it now. What about oversight? Too often I think of &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; with a negative flavor; the person overseeing is the one who either a) gets to be the disciplinarian when things go poorly or b) has to take the blame when things go poorly. No fun either way. But if oversight doesn&rsquo;t kick in until things go poorly then we are failing.</p>
<p>So back to those evaluations where people said the Sunday morning service was good. I think one of the key reasons the Sunday morning service was good, and got better, was that we held weekly meetings on Mondays to critique and review. As a staff we sat down for an hour and discussed the music, the sermon, the rest of the service. What was good? What was bad? What could be done better for next time? Those meetings were good learning times for all of us. I can&rsquo;t think of a single time, though, that we did that kind of evaluation for any of the other ministries I&rsquo;ve been involved in at the church.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we do oversight? First, I think it&rsquo;s the negative connotation. We don&rsquo;t want to be the bad cop who&rsquo;s offering criticism when something is done poorly. Now sure, it&rsquo;s more comfortable not to offer criticism, but we don&rsquo;t usually shy away from it. Why do we shy away from it in church ministry?</p>
<p><strong>1. We&rsquo;re afraid of losing volunteers.</strong> If the gal who runs the overhead projector or the guy who greets at the west door get criticized for doing a poor job, they may just decide that it&rsquo;s not worth it at all. Then we may be out a couple of volunteers&hellip; and isn&rsquo;t having someone that does a hit-or-miss job better than not having anyone? There are a couple responses to this one: first, teaching and shepherding of our people to have them understand the importance of service; second, making sure that we talk to folks regularly, so we have opportunities to praise them for doing an excellent job&hellip; which makes the sting of constructive criticism easier to take later on.</p>
<p><strong>2. We feel guilty for overworking our volunteers</strong> It&rsquo;s the old 80-20 rule, right? 80 percent of the work gets done by 20 percent of the people. In some churches it&rsquo;s probably more like a 90-10 rule. So when one of those 10 percent, a faithful, hard-working volunteer, is doing a poor job in a ministry, we hesitate to mention it because, you know, they&rsquo;re already doing too much already, but we really need somebody to do this, and, well, they&rsquo;re busy, and it&rsquo;s hard to get it all done&hellip; so let&rsquo;s cut them some slack. I am one of those 10 percent people. Even today I have responsibilities that I am doing poorly because I have too many things on my plate.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the response to this one? First, don&rsquo;t overload your people. If somebody&rsquo;s volunteered for too many things, tell them so. Then help them to prioritize so they can do a few things really well. Then get some of those 90 percent people to fill the gaps. If there&rsquo;s no one to fill in, leave a hole there for a while.</p>
<p><strong>3. We feel guilty because we haven&rsquo;t trained well</strong> I&rsquo;m as guilty of this as anyone. To my silly engineering mind, most of these tasks are &ldquo;easy&rdquo;, so I tend to let them go with just a little bit of training. &ldquo;Here, it&rsquo;s just Powerpoint. Turn on the projector, use the remote to flip the slides, turn it off when the songs are done.&rdquo; To most people, things aren&rsquo;t that obvious. The best solution for some of these tasks is apprenticeship - get a new volunteer to work with an old, experienced volunteer for a while to learn the ropes. In times when that&rsquo;s just not possible, set up a time to work with the new volunteer and train them until they&rsquo;re comfortable with the task. Don&rsquo;t just throw them into it on a Sunday morning and leave them hanging. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I&rsquo;ve done it before&hellip; and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p>
<p><strong>Active oversight</strong></p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my call for active oversight of for every volunteer in every ministry going on in the church. Maybe a weekly meeting is infeasible, but a conversation or phone call every couple of weeks would work. As a leader, ask these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you think it&rsquo;s been going? Good? Bad?</li>
<li>Have there been any times that you felt unprepared or out of your depth?</li>
<li>Is there anything I can do to help you do even better next time?</li>
<li>How are things going in your life otherwise?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a leader, be prepared to offer some feedback, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>How you actually think it went.</li>
<li>Suggestions for improvement.</li>
<li>Encouragement to continue well, and a reminder of why we&rsquo;re all serving.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not the responsibility of the pastor to talk to all the volunteers every week, either - this oversight responsibility should delegate down. Let the nursery coordinator be the one that contacts the nursery volunteers on a regular basis. Let the head technical person keep in active touch with the folks who run sound and video every week. Then let the elder overseeing the nursery ministry talk to the ministry coordinator, etc. Flow things up. If everyone gets in the practice of talking to their two or three on a regular basis, everyone stays on the same page, and improvements get made. Just keep in mind the end goal: effective, well-done ministry, in service of God&rsquo;s people, and for God&rsquo;s glory.</p>

			 <p>This seems like such a no-brainer that it shouldn&rsquo;t even need to be mentioned, but based on my experience, it does. Sundays aren&rsquo;t even the best view of this. Look at it through the week. Are the same people that are teaching Sunday School the same people that are hosting a Bible study at their home on Monday, leading kids' clubs on Wednesday, volunteering in the church office on Friday, and showing up on Saturday to help with the work project and get things prepared for Sunday again?</p>
<p>Another place to look carefully here is at the impact not just on individuals, but on families. At one point in time at Noelridge we had six women serving as deaconesses, and of those six, three were elders' wives, and the other three were deacons' wives. Now I&rsquo;m sure this isn&rsquo;t too uncommon - after all that heart for service really <em>should</em> run together in couples, but as a leader, be acutely aware of the combined family schedule, <em>especially</em> for younger families that still have children at home. More than once I have had someone wonder why I thought I was so busy when I was only committed to two or three different activities per week(!) at the church. When I asked them to figure in my wife&rsquo;s commitments, and then remember we have small children at home, well, suddenly expectations change a bit.</p>
<p>Discernment is required here to understand who truly has the time and desire to serve greatly and who is working from feelings of compulsion and guilt. We do not get the best service from our people when they have a dozen things on their plate. Something will get missed, and something else will be done poorly. To my shame, I have done this often enough myself. As leaders we need to be willing to protect those overly-willing servants by telling them when they have enough on their plate, and then to fill the gaps we need to get a fire lit under those who aren&rsquo;t helping out.</p>
<p>I visited <a href="http://raewhitlock.com">a friend&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://gracecentral.org">new church website</a> the other day and under the tab titled &ldquo;what we do&rdquo;, I found these refreshing words: &ldquo;At Grace Central, we basically only do three things.&rdquo; Wow, I thought, only three things? Now those spread out a bit in ministry, I&rsquo;m sure - it&rsquo;s not like there are only three events on their calendar every week. But still, the focus: only three things. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit in one of those boxes, it&rsquo;s not essential, and we&rsquo;re not going to do it.</p>
<p>From their website again [emphasis mine]: &ldquo;&hellip;we want to try very hard to limit what we do to only those things which we are convinced are essential. That way people are encouraged to take what they are learning at Grace Central and go out into their lives to apply it and to discover the radical implications of God’s grace. <em>We think being a responsible church means our people should have time for relationships and activities outside of our church as well</em>.&rdquo; Amen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week Richard (my pastor for the past 8 years who is also leading our <a href="http://www.icatcp.org">church plant</a> effort) asked me this question: What do we need to do to have more effective ministries at the church? He shared with me that in the past 15 years when he has had the opportunity to conduct &ldquo;exit interviews&rdquo; of folks who have left the church for one reason or another, the predominant theme he gets is that the Sunday morning service is good, but that the ministries that go on through the week leave something to be desired.</p>
<p>So that got my wheels turning. Why is there this disparity? What can we do to change things to make it better? This is crucial both for our existing ministry at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a> and our upcoming ministry at <a href="http://www.icatcp.org">Imago Christi</a>. Are there processes we should put in place that would help? Are there things in place right now that are unnecessary hindrances to the effort of ministry?</p>
<p>I had a few answers for him there in our conversation, but I want to take the chance to explore them more fully here on the blog. So over the next few days I am going to explore some areas where I think we can improve things in our ministry - and I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;s applicable and useful for my non-Noelridge readers as well as the locals.</p>
<p>As a note to my Noelridge readers: please don&rsquo;t read any of this and feel that it&rsquo;s a criticism of you, of your efforts in ministry at Noelridge, or of your dedication to the Lord. The responsibility for this stuff falls on the leadership. We are the ones that need to take a hard look and then, if need be, change things. It&rsquo;s entirely possible that some of the ideas I explore here won&rsquo;t even be good options for Noelridge. What I am hoping these accomplish is to get us to think on some things and have a productive discussion. So please, leave comments and discuss.</p>

			 <p>OK, rarely will I write a full post to recommend someone else&rsquo;s post, but the latest from software-manager-<em>par-excellance</em> Rands is just too good to pass up. He has me nailed. In <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html">his latest post</a>, Rands lists off his &ldquo;Nerd Handbook&rdquo;. Becky had only to read the first two sentences and she was chuckling in the knowledge that this guy was describing me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A nerd needs a project because a nerd builds stuff. All the time. Those lulls in the conversation over dinner? That’s the nerd working on his project in his head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guilty as charged.</p>
<p>A few other priceless bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”. Nerds know how a computer works. They intimately know how a computer works. When you ask a nerd, “When I click this, it takes awhile for the thing to show up. Do you know what’s wrong?” they know what’s wrong. A nerd has a mental model of the hardware and the software in his head. While the rest of the world sees magic, your nerd knows how the magic works, he knows the magic is a long series of ones and zeros moving across your screen with impressive speed, and he knows how to make those bits move faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your nerd lives in a monospaced typeface world. Whereas everyone else is traipsing around picking dazzling fonts to describe their world, your nerd has carefully selected a monospace typeface, which he avidly uses to manipulate the world deftly via a command line interface while the rest fumble around with a mouse.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The reason for this typeface selection is, of course, practicality. Monospace typefaces have a knowable width. Ten letters on one line are same width as ten other letters, which puts the world into a pleasant grid construction where X and Y mean something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, monospaced font, how I love thee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humor is an intellectual puzzle, “How can this particular set of esoteric trivia be constructed to maximize hilarity as quickly as possible?” Your nerd listens hard to recognize humor potential and when he hears it, he furiously scours his mind to find relevant content from his experience so he can get the funny out as quickly as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Got me again.</p>
<p>And the most painful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your nerd has built an annoyingly efficient relevancy engine in his head. It’s the end of the day and you and your nerd are hanging out on the couch. The TV is off. There isn’t a computer anywhere nearby and you’re giving your nerd the daily debrief. “Spent an hour at the post office trying to ship that package to your mom, and then I went down to that bistro — you know — the one next the flower shop, and it’s closed. Can you believe that?”<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And your nerd says, “Cool”.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Cool? What’s cool? The business closing? The package? How is any of it cool? None of it’s cool. Actually, all of it might be cool, but your nerd doesn’t believe any of what you’re saying is relevant. This is what he heard, “Spent an hour at the post office blah blah blah…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool. I mean, ouch.</p>
<p>There is a lot of good stuff that I didn&rsquo;t quote here, so if you really want to get an insight into me, yeah, <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html">go read the article</a>. For my sensitive readers, yeah, there are a couple bad words in the post. Ignore them. Read the rest of it. Well worth it.</p>

			 <p>Yep, 105 comments held in moderation. All of &lsquo;em spam. I guess I should tighten up Spam Karma 2 a little bit. But still, not hard to bulk-moderate &lsquo;em all into oblivion.</p>
<p>Other thoughts from the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell phones showed up yesterday via Fedex. It was easy to activate them, then dialed 0 to get out of a weird automated service and talked to a very nice real person at Verizon who got our number port going.</li>
<li>One odd thing: in the store and on their website, Verizon claims that porting a number over will take between one and four hours. When I actually initiated the port yesterday afternoon, the woman told me it could take up to 72 hours. It&rsquo;s been 16 hours so far, and still nothing.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve had colds most all week at our house. Not fun. Haven&rsquo;t actually slept through the night in a couple of weeks. No wonder I&rsquo;m tired.</li>
<li>Going back to Standard Time from Daylight Time makes it feel like winter to me. That&rsquo;s what I associate with winter: that it&rsquo;s dark by suppertime. And so it is this week. On the positive side, we&rsquo;ve been getting to bed earlier, though whether that&rsquo;s due more to the time change or the sickness is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</li>
<li>It sounds like we are ever-so-close to having a building deal done for our church plant. It will be nice to get a start date set and then get this thing going. I&rsquo;m guessing the first Saturday in January - that would be 1/5/08.</li>
<li>I had no meetings scheduled at work yesterday, and none again today. Must be some kind of record. Not that I&rsquo;m complaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that&rsquo;s pretty much my week. Not very exciting.</p>
<p>Oh, one last thing I should mention: congratulations to my friend Geof who <a href="http://ijsm.org/archives/2007/11/08/space-flight-awareness-honoree/">has won a Space Flight Awareness Award</a> from NASA. It&rsquo;s a big deal. Wish I could come with you to see the shuttle launch, G, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get free. And I&rsquo;m not a single woman, either, so I&rsquo;m a bit out of your target demographic. ;-)</p>

			 <p>After running the numbers and looking at likely use scenarios over the upcoming year or two, we finally decided to switch our cell phone service from US Cellular, our provider of the past seven years, to Verizon. Their plans are fairly similar, but when it came down to it, the employer discount that Verizon offers was enough to sway the balance in their direction.</p>
<p>So last night Becky and I had a couple hours while the girls were at a friend&rsquo;s house, and we headed to the local Verizon establishment to get things set up. We had researched phones already, so it was just a matter of getting the phones and setting up the service. Some observations:</p>
<p><strong>Good things:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Welcome/Service</strong>: Verizon gave a very good first impression. The manager greeted us as we entered the store, asked a few questions to find out how he could help, then took our names, double-checked that our existing phone numbers were portable (they are), and answered a couple questions while waiting for a member of the sales staff to get free. Well done, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of signup:</strong> We made this pretty easy because I already knew exactly what plan I wanted. I told the sales guy that we wanted <em>that</em> plan and <em>those</em> phones, and he pretty much took care of the rest. He was able to scan the bar code on my Iowa driver&rsquo;s license to get all that pertinent info (no possibility of transcription errors!); the only thing I had to give him was my SSN and my email addresses (work email to qualify for the employee discount, home email for account correspondence).</p>
<p><strong>Not-so-good things:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phone availability</strong>: Our salesman went to the back to grab the phones we wanted and seemed to take a while. Finally he came back empty-handed and asked his co-worker if they were, in fact, out of the Nokia phones that we were looking for. His co-worker&rsquo;s response: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any of those in a <em>long</em> time.&rdquo; Not an exceptionally heartening reply. However, Verizon will Fedex us the phones for free and we can activate them once they are delivered. While this didn&rsquo;t allay the disappointment of not being able to walk out with a new phone, it&rsquo;s at least a reasonable solution, and we&rsquo;re getting good phones at a good price.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> A couple of things here. First off, while it was clear I was getting some sort of employee discount on the service, it wasn&rsquo;t clear that I was getting a similar discount on the phones. The phones that we were getting were listed on the placard as $80 with a $50 mail-in rebate. However, when they were rung up for sale, I was only charged $20 each; no rebate necessary. While I&rsquo;m not complaining about the lower price, had I known that I was receiving a 30% discount on the phones themselves, I would likely have considered buying a slightly more expensive phone. But I&rsquo;m happy with the one I&rsquo;m getting, so that&rsquo;s mostly their loss of a sale.</p>
<p>Second thing: I never once saw a piece of paper with the cell contract, details, or my contact information on it. I found this to be a bit odd. In past signups with US Cellular, I had to sign multiple copies of a contract, verify that all my information was correct, etc. This time: nothing. Now I know there&rsquo;s a 30-day money-back period where I can go change things if they really messed something up, it would&rsquo;ve been more comforting had I at least been given a one-page printout summarizing my purchase; something for me to verify that they got my name and email in the system correctly, that they had signed me up for what I wanted, basically just a receipt of sorts.</p>
<p>Which leads to the third issue - my email addresses. I had to dictate the email addresses to the salesman. He got the work email address correct; I had that email waiting for me this morning. But I have yet to receive an email to my home address; I was supposed to get one welcoming me to Verizon, giving links to log into the Verizon customer website, etc. I can only imagine that the sales guy transcribed it wrong, and of course, I had no way to verify it. (See above.) For future reference, how would you dictate &lsquo;chris.hubbs&rsquo; as part of an email address? I said &ldquo;chris dot hubbs&rdquo; and assumed it was obvious, but I have a bad feeling that there&rsquo;s an email floating around in cyberspace this morning looking for the &lsquo;chrisdothubbs&rsquo; email address. :-(</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait until we get the phones here later in the week to make a final decision. (Oh, another thing that would&rsquo;ve been nice: a Fedex tracking number for the phones. Probably also emailed to chrisdothubbs.) Overall, it was a pretty good, easy experience last night; a one-page confirmation sheet, though, would&rsquo;ve taken it from &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; to &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>No costumes &lsquo;round our building today, but we&rsquo;re having an event that appears to be proving popular enough that it should be continued in following years: a chili cook-off. A dozen or so contestants brought in crock pots full of chili of varying color, flavor, and spiciness. (Question, though: can green tortilla chicken soup really be called &ldquo;chili&rdquo;? I think it should be disqualified. It is tasty, though.) The rest of us brought in acoutrements. Voting ends at noon. Sampling has been going on all morning.</p>
<p>Maybe next year I&rsquo;ll have to give it a whirl&hellip; but the competition would be stiff. Were I to have brought a pot of my usual chili along today, well, I wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for it. There are some <em>amazing</em> chilis out there.</p>
<p>Might be time to go through and sample some more. The little styrofoam cups are just the thing, though one guy should win the innovation award for sampling utensils: he brought along a 6-cup muffin tin. Brilliant!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last night Becky and I experienced a couple of firsts: 1) going to a concert at <a href="http://www.legionarts.org">CSPS</a> in downtown Cedar Rapids, and 2) hearing <a href="http://www.davidwilcox.com">David Wilcox</a> perform. I&rsquo;ll take them in that order, but the first will be brief.</p>
<p>CSPS is a pretty cool music venue; an arts gallery and concert stage built into the upper stories of an old warehouse building. The performance area is an intimate setting - no more than 8 or 9 rows of chairs on hand-built risers, right up near the little stage. It&rsquo;s designed to seat about 150, and wow, it works well. I was thinking how much fun it&rsquo;d be to get any one of several <a href="http://www.squarepegalliance.com">Square Pegs</a> in there&hellip; hmmm&hellip; I&rsquo;ll have to keep that in mind. Anyhow, pretty sweet venue.</p>
<p>Then we got to hear David Wilcox. This was my first experience hearing David, though I did find myself familiar with a few of his songs that have been covered by Billy Heller singing down at <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">Brewed Awakenings</a>. David&rsquo;s first set was broadcast live on <a href="http://kuniradio.org/">KUNI radio</a> as part of their regular <a href="http://www.kuniradio.org/kustud.html">&ldquo;Live from Studio One&rdquo;</a> show, which I think rearranged his setlist a bit from what he&rsquo;d normally do in a concert, shifting most all of his more popular songs up front. Still, he played two great sets of songs, just him and his guitar. And quite a guitar player he is, using lots of open tunings and capos to marvelous effect. His songwriting, though, is what really shines; the phrasing and ideas of songs like <a href="http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=news&amp;display=915">Three Brothers</a> and <a href="http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=253">Show the Way</a> just rise above the lyrical skill you usually hear from, well, about anyone. I was very, very impressed.</p>
<p>As I sat through the show I kept trying to decide who Wilcox reminded me of. Vocally he sounds a bit like James Taylor, but without the annoying nasal tone that Taylor has. Heck, Wilcox can really sing. And then when I was just about done being impressed with his voice, breaks out some falsetto on the last song that was just amazing. Visually, put a scruffy beard on him and give him a cane and I&rsquo;d be reminded of <a href="http://www.fox.com/house/">Dr. Greg House</a>. There were times I was reminded of CCM artist Chris Rice, except that Wilcox reaches a level with his songwriting that Rice has never hit. I guess I don&rsquo;t quite have enough words to say, or, as his one song said, I really can&rsquo;t tell of the places I&rsquo;ve been. Sometimes you just have to have been there. Thanks to <a href="http://lapointemusic.com">Nick</a> and <a href="http://lapointemusic.blogspot.com">Allie</a> for inviting us along for a great night.</p>

			 <p>I hit the scale last Saturday after a fairly physically strenuous day of outdoor work (OK, strenuous for me at least), a time when usually the scale is nice to me (hey, I know how to work the system), and I was not happy at what I saw. It wasn&rsquo;t Garfield&rsquo;s &ldquo;one at a time, please&rdquo;, but it <em>was</em> a few pounds higher than I thought it would be, and a solid 7 or so pounds higher than it was when I was at my low point back in February or so. Eesh. I haven&rsquo;t been just totally letting myself go, I guess, but I have been snacking too much lately and well, we do all enjoy dessert.</p>
<p>So I declared this week to be &ldquo;No Excuses&rdquo; week for me when it came to exercise - I needed to do something every day. With the gym only 1 mile down the road I don&rsquo;t really have much excuse anyway; in general, my natural laziness + staying up too late at night = not getting up to work out in the morning. So this week there hasn&rsquo;t been anything compelling to stay up and watch on TV (World Series starts tonight, though&hellip; uh oh), I haven&rsquo;t been involved in a really engrossing book (my other late-night weakness), and so it&rsquo;s been better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monday:</strong> 2 miles on the treadmill.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> 1 mile on the treadmill, some weights. I have only recently discovered the bench press, and it&rsquo;s frightening how little I can press. Something to work on.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> 2 more miles on the treadmill, with a better time than on Monday.</li>
</ul>
<p>My other good accountability tool in this is an online calorie tracker. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com">The Daily Plate</a> off an on for a while now&hellip; this week it&rsquo;s back on. It lets you enter your height/weight/age and a weight loss goal, and then gives you a calorie-per-day target. It has calorie info for pretty much anything you&rsquo;d eat, so you can just look it up, indicate how much you ate, and it gives you a nice nutritional summary.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my big push for this week. It feels good, too. Hopefully the scale will be a little friendlier to me next time I get on. Then the challenge is continuing. I think long-term it&rsquo;s unrealistic to think I will hit the gym <em>every</em> morning <em>every</em> week, but if I could hit it 3 times a week plus play basketball one night? Well, that will be a big help.</p>

			 <p>Bullet points for the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.icatcp.org">Church plant</a> plans are moving right along. Looking like the start date might be the beginning of the year.</li>
<li>Tonight will be my first night all week of just coming home from work and being home. Too many evening activities makes for a long week.</li>
<li>Major weekend activity: tree trimming and collecting brush. Hiawatha picks up brush starting Monday.</li>
<li>Waiting to hear whether or not I get a freelance website development job. Hoping I do.</li>
<li>You know you&rsquo;re short on sleep when the Diet Pepsi doesn&rsquo;t really help things any.</li>
<li>The new Iron and Wine album (<em>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Dog</em>) is really good.</li>
<li>The new Radiohead album is good as well. I don&rsquo;t usually dig Radiohead, but the new album is quite accessible.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meebo.com">Meebo</a> (my browser-based chat client of choice) just released a Firefox plugin that&rsquo;s actually pretty good. Not perfect yet, but beats having to keep extra FF windows open.</li>
</ul>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2007/10/10/convergence-death-of.html">Convergence: Death of a PDA, Expiration of a Cell Contract</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2007/10/10/convergence-death-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-10-10 22:55:36 -0500">Oct 10, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve carried a PDA pretty much everywhere with me for the past several years; I think I&rsquo;ve been through three different Palm models. My current one is a Palm Tungsten E2. I don&rsquo;t use too many features on it, really; my primary uses are the calendar and a few games. The calendar is the biggie for me - I need something to keep all my work meetings and outside meetings lined up. The past few weeks my PDA has had trouble holding a charge. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether I charge it via USB or from the wall charger; within 10 minutes or so it complains about the battery being low and starts disabling functions. I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s nearing the end of its life - <a href="/05/09/officemax-replacement-watch-day-26/">I&rsquo;ve had it just over two years now</a>.</p>
<p>Second upcoming event: our cell phone contract is just about up. I haven&rsquo;t completely decided yet, but I&rsquo;m thinking we&rsquo;ll abandon US Cellular in favor of Verizon, for a number of reasons. With the new contract comes the opportunity to purchase a new phone at a reduced price. So I have a convergence here which might allow me to start consolidating electronic gadgetry. So I want to explore my options.</p>
<p>Desired operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cell phone operation</li>
<li>A usable calendar that allows for easy entry and reference. My employer uses an antiquated Lotus Notes system for email and calendar, so I&rsquo;m not counting on the ability to sync things up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Heck, I think that&rsquo;s basically it. So what are my options?</p>
<p>Geof was the first to respond to my tweet on this topic. <a href="http://twitter.com/gfmorris/statuses/320980982">His words</a>: &ldquo;this is God&rsquo;s way of getting you to buy an iPhone.&rdquo; Geof was an iPhone early-adopter and has had nothing but good to say about it. And I will admit that I&rsquo;ve drooled over the iPhone a time or two. Who can&rsquo;t love its wonderful touch-screen interface and Apple styling?</p>
<p>I have a few issues with the iPhone option, though. I&rsquo;m not crazy about the price, but hey, if I&rsquo;m replacing a PDA, the iPhone isn&rsquo;t really any more expensive. Does the iPhone even have a calendar feature? Surely it must. But I don&rsquo;t really want to use it to replace my iPod - I want my iPod to be able to hold my entire music collection, and they don&rsquo;t make a 40 GB iPhone yet. :-)</p>
<p>The other issue, which will be an issue for all web-enabled phones, is that I don&rsquo;t really need full connectivity all the time. Goodness knows I check my email often enough as it is, I certainly don&rsquo;t need <em>another</em> way that I can be distracted. And the data plans that come hand-in-hand with these smartphones end up adding $30 - $40 per month to your cell plan. For the type of plan we&rsquo;d have, that&rsquo;s almost a 50% increase, which is too much.</p>
<p>There are other cell/PDA combos out there; you can get a Palm Treo, any one of several models of Blackberry, and some &ldquo;smartphones&rdquo; that the cell providers offer. But again, I don&rsquo;t want/need the data plan. I just want something that&rsquo;ll give me phone capability and help keep me organized.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s a guy to do?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Business has brought me this week to Oklahoma City, square in the middle of the Sooner state. I&rsquo;ve been to the Tulsa area many times (my grandparents having lived in Collinsville for twenty years), but while I&rsquo;ve driven through OKC on I-35 a multitude of times, I don&rsquo;t recall ever having stopped; certainly I&rsquo;ve never stayed here overnight. So it&rsquo;s like visiting a new place, which I really enjoy - a chance for observations, to learn a new city.</p>
<p>My first impression of OKC was at the airport. I like the OKC airport. It appears to be fairly new, is large, open, airy, and bright. It&rsquo;s a fair bit larger than my home port of Cedar Rapids, but not immense; twenty-some gates and a three-story parking garage. It was only a short walk through the terminal to the Hertz desk to pick up my key, then a short stroll to the parking structure to my car (a Toyota Corolla, very nice). The Hertz #1 Club Gold, letting me skip the paperwork and head straight to the car, is worth every penny.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving the airport, I ran into the seemingly inevitable road construction. In this case, the construction is on Meridian Ave, the main drag that heads north out of the airport and up to I-44 and my hotel. This trimmed a four-lane highway down to two rather narrow lanes, and made the waits at traffic lights frustratingly long. Still, the trusty Never-Lost GPS system in the car got me within visual distance of the hotel before announcing &ldquo;You have arrived.&rdquo;, and I could handle it from there.</p>
<p>My next impression of OKC came from the hotel that the Federal Aviation Administration selected for our training this week: the Clarion Meridian Hotel and Convention Center. The hotel seems to be a microcosm of the city as a whole, trying to move forward from the dusty, tired, and worn trappings of the old oil and ranch business into the technology of the twenty-first century. The hotel dates to probably the 1970&rsquo;s. It was originally all exterior-entry rooms, but some time later in an attempt to upgrade an additional hallway was built outside the room doors, allowing for climate-controlled access to the hotel lobby from the rooms. The room itself has had fresh paint and sports two 25-inch televisions with local cable, but it&rsquo;s still obviously a remodel and the layout just isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>
<p>Driving through the city the past couple of nights I have seen the same contrasts; on one side, dusty, dated businesses feeling like the older southwest of the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s; on the other side, a trendy, new city whose Dell Computer campus gives you another reason to compare it to Austin, TX. My restaurant choices thus far have been limited to the &ldquo;new&rdquo; side of things; I ate at a &ldquo;grill and brewhouse&rdquo; on the north side of town tonight that was very tasty. I might still be tempted to try an older steakhouse tomorrow night&hellip; I guess I&rsquo;ll see what sounds good when my class has wrapped up.</p>
<p>The instructor at our class today told us he&rsquo;s lived in Oklahoma for most of his life. He described OKC as &ldquo;a great place to live, and an OK place to visit.&rdquo; Now, when the Oklahoma tourism folks originally created the &ldquo;Oklahoma is OK&rdquo; slogan, I&rsquo;m guessing they weren&rsquo;t intending the suggestion of mediocrity that our instructor gave us, but after being here two days I&rsquo;m thinking he&rsquo;s closer to the truth. In many ways, the situation that OKC finds itself in reminds me of my home state of Iowa; a good, solid midwestern state, a good place to raise a family, a place struggling to find its way beyond its agricultural roots into technological opportunities. Not a super-exciting place to visit, but that&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s a lot less hassle than the more exotic destinations, too. For this traveler, this week, Oklahoma is, indeed, OK.</p>

<li>Had a productive weekend; got the lawn mowed, some concrete patching done, led music at church.</li>
<li>Miserable weekend as a sports fan: Cubs played terrible and got swept; Huskers got mauled by Mizzou; Hawkeyes ran into a freight train called Penn State. At least the NHL season is new, so Dallas can&rsquo;t be too far out of it yet.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m headed to Oklahoma City for training tomorrow. Can&rsquo;t imagine it&rsquo;ll be too exciting. Let&rsquo;s just see if I can get somewhere on time this time. My recent luck with flights hasn&rsquo;t been good. Flying United this time.</li>
<li>Listening to the new album from Iron and Wine. It&rsquo;s good.</li>
<li>I am officially now a Company Designated Engineering Representative (DER) for the FAA. I have only partial approval authority at the moment; it&rsquo;ll take time and experience to get full approval authority.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been a week now of just bringing a bottle of pop to work in the morning rather than filling my mug at the convenience store. It&rsquo;s going OK. I have decided, though, that Coke Zero is too sweet for me - I like Diet Pepsi better.</li>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t enjoyed a single episode of TV quite so much in a while. I&rsquo;m a couple weeks behind on Dr. Who, but finally watched the episode called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.scifi.com/doctorwho/episodes/episodes.php?seas=3&amp;ep=0310&amp;act=1">Blink</a>&rdquo; tonight. A very, very good episode. [Spoilers ahead, so if you&rsquo;re going to watch it and want to be surprised, don&rsquo;t read on.]</p>
<p>First of all, the idea of weeping stone angels as quantum-locked beings who are only alive when no one is looking at them? Awesome. Now, the whole time-travel plot device of having someone send messages to themself in the past is far from new - Phillip K. Dick wrote a short story with that premise, which got adapted into a so-so movie called <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0338337/">Paycheck</a></em> a few years back. But it was really well done here. And the whole final scene where the human has one-up on the Doctor, because she knows what&rsquo;s gonna happen, and he doesn&rsquo;t yet? Brilliant. And so well done.</p>
<p>Dr. Who can be really cheesy at times, but this season has done well. And <em>Blink</em> is definitely the best episode to date.</p>

			 <p><strong>&ldquo;Clergy fight same sex marriage&rdquo;</strong>. This headline stared out at me from this morning&rsquo;s copy of the <a href="http://gazetteonline.com">Cedar Rapids <em>Gazette</em></a>. The sub-heading (which was used as the title of <a href="http://gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070927/NEWS/70927010/1006/NEWS">the online version of the story</a>) gives more detail: &ldquo;Iowa church leaders planning rally &lsquo;defending marriage&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A coalition of church leaders today announced plans for an Oct. 28 prayer rally and other actions to defend traditional marriage in the face of a district judge&rsquo;s ruling striking down a same-sex marriage ban &ndash; a development they warned could convert Iowa into the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rainbow Vegas.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;This is a call to arms,&rdquo; said Dan Berry of Cornerstone Family Church. &ldquo;The sleeping giant is being awakened.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the story, the Rev. Keith Ratliff of Maple Street Missionary Baptist Church in Des Moines said the &ldquo;&hellip;campaign is not geared toward hate or fear of homosexuals, but rather seeks to preserve the longstanding, family-based and Bible-backed tradition of marriage as being a union between a man and a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final, colorful quote in the story comes from Chuck Hurley of the Iowa Family Policy Center, who warns that if the same-sex marriage ban is permanently reversed, Iowa will be come &ldquo;the Rainbow Vegas&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We have gotten all too familiar with hearing pastors and Christian leaders like these over the past two decades. On a national level, radio hosts like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dobson">Dr. Dobson</a>, televangelists/presidential candidates such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_robertson">Pat Robertson</a>, and leaders of movements like the Moral Majority (the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_falwell">Rev. Jerry Falwell</a>, an OK guy in my book), and later on the Christian Coalition (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_E._Reed%2C_Jr.">Ralph Reed</a>, who turned out to be a bit more crooked), urged their listeners or viewers to call their congressman, write their legislator, to stop this piece of legislation, encourage that one, or to decry a recent judicial ruling.</p>
<p>There is a place in the life of a Christian for speaking the truth to our community. In many cases that should and will include involvement in the political arena. At our church this past week we had a petition on the table in the foyer urging Iowa lawmakers to pass a state constitutional amendment in &ldquo;defense of marriage&rdquo;, and to urge them to support an amendment to the federal constitution as well. One of our elders, during announcement time in the service, asked folks to consider signing it. Many did. (I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not so sure that we should change the constitution for something like this.) But I fear for the sake of the Gospel and our churches when what our pastors are known for are leading the &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo; into the political arena when those rascally judges finally go too far. (Why is the church &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo;, anyway? Maybe that&rsquo;s problem <em>numero uno</em>.)</p>
<p>Particularly disgusting to me was the quote from Mr. Hurley of the Iowa Family Policy Center, pulling out the scare tactics to warn good little church people that their beloved, safe hometowns will become a &ldquo;Rainbow Vegas&rdquo;. &ldquo;Ooh! Run away!!! Gay people!!! Be afraid!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know whether Hurley is a pastor or not, but the <a href="http://www.iowaprofamily.org/">IFPC website</a> is pretty plainly espousing Christianity, including on their site a <a href="http://www.iowaprofamily.org/IFPC-Prayer.htm">Prayer Request page</a> with a quote from John Bunyan. Mr. Hurley, I see plenty of prayer requests on that page for new donors, success in the courts and the legislature, and politically active people. But where&rsquo;s the prayer request that these people who you fear so strongly would hear the good news of Jesus Christ and be freed from their bondage to sin? If we&rsquo;re going to rouse the &ldquo;sleeping giant&rdquo; of the church, why are you only rousing them to join the political fight against your adversaries rather than rousing them to minister to and serve those same people?</p>
<p>Our primary command as believers in Jesus Christ is the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%2016:15;&amp;version=47;">Great Commission</a>: to go into all the world and proclaim the gospel. We are not to huddle in a spirit of fear, desperately attempting to protect our little enclave against the evil world around us. Christ has already won the victory. It&rsquo;s over. Instead, we need to go <strong>to</strong> &ldquo;those people&rdquo;, and love them. Serve them. Find out who they are. What makes them tick. Show them the love of Christ in action, so that when we find avenues to share it verbally, they will already understand. We are not to fear &ldquo;them&rdquo;, but rather to fear <strong>for</strong> them, knowing that we, too, were once hopelessly ensnared in sin. Our new righteousness is not our own; we dare not boast in it. Only in Christ.</p>
<p>Change comes from the inside. Pass all the laws you want, legislate your own specific understanding of perfect morality, but if you don&rsquo;t change the hearts, laws aren&rsquo;t gonna do any good. (See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States">The Prohibition</a>.) However, if lives are changed by the power of God, pass or repeal all the laws you want; people living for Christ will make whatever country they live in the kind of country that you probably want it to be. I fear that the siren song of political power has been too attractive to the Church. Let&rsquo;s stop being distracted by it, and focus instead on loving our neighbor.</p>

			 <p>I have a usual stop on my way to work in the mornings: the Road Ranger convenience store at the corner of Blair&rsquo;s Ferry and I-380. I have an old 52oz insulated mug that I have a habit of filling up with Diet Pepsi. Yeah, I guess I&rsquo;m a little bit addicted. Ever since they became Road Ranger, the refills of that mug have been pleasantly inexpensive - I&rsquo;ve been paying a whole $0.62 for a refill.</p>
<p>This morning, though, there was a change - they&rsquo;ve upped the price on me to $1.05. I guess that&rsquo;s $0.99 + sales tax. And suddenly I&rsquo;m not so excited about it. Something about paying with a dollar and still getting change back was cool with me; something about paying a dollar plus another coin makes it seem much less appealing. Still, I&rsquo;m not quite sure that just going cold turkey is such a good idea, either. And then there&rsquo;s the all-too-tempting vending machine at work where a 20 oz bottle of pop costs $1.25. Heck, if I&rsquo;m gonna do that, I may as well just stop for my $1.05 mug in the morning.</p>
<p>Maybe a better alternative would be to buy a pack of bottled pop from the store, throw it in the fridge, and bring along a bottle in the morning. That&rsquo;d cut the price down, and hopefully start weaning my caffeine addiction&hellip; well, a guy can hope.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s Wednesday. I am looking forward to a couple packages coming later in the week, though. Tomorrow, DHL should be bringing the new shoes I ordered last night. I&rsquo;ve had my old Converse Chuck Taylor lo-tops for a year now, and have worn them out pretty good. It was time for a new pair. This time I&rsquo;m living on the wild side - instead of replacing my black ones with another black pair, I&rsquo;m getting green. That should be fun. :-) I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever had a package delivered via DHL before, and I will say now that I&rsquo;m very impressed with their package tracking on their website - it seems to be more granular and updated more frequently than UPS&rsquo;s tracking info ever is.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week I got a gift card from work as an &ldquo;alternative reward&rdquo;. Cool. Even better is that with that gift card I&rsquo;m getting a set of Shure E2c headphones. I know several folks that swear by them, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the purchase for a while now. They were on &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; at Target last week for $89, but I got &lsquo;em off Amazon for $60.</p>
<p>This weekend on Saturday we&rsquo;re headed to Des Moines overnight - we just needed to get out of town for a day or two. All my business travel has finally added up to enough Hilton rewards points to get us a free hotel room on Saturday night, and I don&rsquo;t have to lead music on Sunday, so we&rsquo;re off to visit the zoo, an orchard, and whatever else we find interesting in the big city. Can&rsquo;t wait.</p>

			 <p>I presented this letter to the elder board at Noelridge last Thursday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the Elders at Noelridge:<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It has been my privilege to serve the body at Noelridge with you for the past eight years, first as a deacon apprentice, then for a time as a deacon, then for a few years as an elder apprentice, and now for the past 18 months as an elder. You are dear brothers and friends to me, and I have learned much from each of you. However, the Lord has burdened my heart to serve fully in the upcoming church plant in downtown Cedar Rapids. As the day of the first service draws near, I find myself needing to devote more time to planning and preparation for that mission, and straining to try to remain consistent in my duties at Noelridge. I therefore request to be released from my responsibilities as an elder at Noelridge Park Church, effective immediately.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
After much discussion with my wife, it is our plan that our family will attend the new church regularly and not Noelridge; our desire is for effective ministry balanced with church stability for ourselves and our daughters. I will work to make arrangements to transfer my various responsibilities to other church members over the coming weeks. I anticipate that I will continue to assist in leading music for the time being; Dave Tessier and I will work out plans to ensure that both Noelridge and the new congregation are well-led musically. We all covet your prayers as we embark on this great mission in the service of our Savior.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In Christ’s love,<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Chris Hubbs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a big change for us. But we&rsquo;re excited about this <a href="http://www.icatcp.org">church plant</a>, and ready to see it happen. To my brothers and sisters at Noelridge who will undoubtedly read this and may have it be the first you&rsquo;ve heard of it: yes, it means changes. We do have plans in the works that will mean I&rsquo;ll still be leading music at Noelridge once a month or so. And we&rsquo;ll still be around on Wednesday nights, so you haven&rsquo;t seen the last of Becky and the girls, either. :-) Pray for us and this church plant. We want to see great things for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

			 <p>Back in February I bought my first-ever fountain pen. I knew nothing about them, but had always thought they would be cool, so when I encountered a pen shop in a mall in Washington, DC, I was a goner. I ended up with <a href="http://www.fahrneyspens.com/item--i-182511-BLK-B--m-2_315_316.html">a cheap Retro 51 pen</a> with a nib that was really too wide and that didn&rsquo;t lay down ink very well at all. But I was hooked.</p>
<p>In May, back in DC, I had done my research, and bought another pen, similar in price to the Retro 51, but far superior in function: a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Al-Star-Fountain-Pen/dp/B0009F1I84/">Lamy Safari Al Star</a>. The lightweight aluminum body was stylish and the Fine nib ended up being just to my liking. Along with the pen I purchased an ink adapter and a bottle of blue ink. I really enjoyed that pen.</p>
<p>I use the past tense in the previous sentence because on my trip to Orlando in June I lost it somewhere on an airplane. I was bummed. Not having a lot of disposable income this summer, I knew it would be a good lesson to me to just deal with ballpoint pens again for a while&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;d hold onto the next pen more carefully. (Am I sounding like a parent here? I think I am. Scary.)</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I was given a very nice gift for playing the organ for a wedding. So as a little gift to myself I went online and ordered a replacement Safari Al Star. It arrived in the mail late last week and I am thoroughly enjoying it. Writing is so much more fun with a pen like this.</p>
<p>Last time I was in <a href="http://paradisepens.com">that pen shop in DC</a> they were trying hard to sell me a pen that ran about $150. I don&rsquo;t know that I could ever really understand why I should spend <em>that</em> much for a pen&hellip; but I&rsquo;m sure happy with my $30 cheap-o.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been slow around these parts lately, which likely just means that life has been pretty busy. Even online there have been a bunch of other projects that have been taking my time. I guess I could discuss a few of them and you might not get too bored. :-)</p>
<p>One of the web projects I&rsquo;ve been working on is a new site for <a href="http://www.coldwaterprograms.org">Coldwater Programs</a>. Kevin Sutton is raising support for this outdoor exploration and leadership training ministry. I&rsquo;ve done some design and layout work on the site, now it&rsquo;s just waiting for him to add content.</p>
<p>Another site that kicked off last week is the <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.net/forum/">AndrewOsenga.net forum</a>, which is an online home for the fan community of Andy O, as he is affectionately known. I&rsquo;ve been happy to see folks registering and discussing thus far, I hope it will continue. I enjoy the interacting and discussing.</p>
<p>The other big thing coming up is the church plant. No, not the philodendron on the piano. We here at Noelridge along with a coalition of other churches in the area are planning to start a new church in downtown Cedar Rapids. We have a facility we can meet at, and we&rsquo;re planning on starting services on Saturday night, October 27th. The Saturday night service will be an adjustment for me, but I&rsquo;m really looking forward to see what the Lord has for us down there. I&rsquo;ll be the music guy; I&rsquo;m also doing some website design. The name isn&rsquo;t finalized yet, but <a href="http://www.imagochristichurch.org">one potential domain name</a> has already been reserved and I&rsquo;ve been doing some basic web design.</p>
<p>So at the moment it&rsquo;s Sunday morning and why am I blogging on Sunday morning? I&rsquo;m on the laptop at church, ripping this morning&rsquo;s sermon audio to mp3 so it can be posted on the <a href="http://noelridge.org">church website</a>. Laura is downstairs in Sunday School, and Becky is off running errands. This laptop is pretty old and slow, so I have a bit of time to write before it&rsquo;s done ripping the audio. Then it&rsquo;ll be homeward bound for a bit of rest before work starts up again tomorrow. Life is busy, but life is good.</p>

			 <p>The joys of having a Monday holiday: a 4-day work week, and a Tuesday that feels like Monday. Oh, and a Tuesday jammed full of meetings since they couldn&rsquo;t schedule &lsquo;em on Monday. (And <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof</a>, don&rsquo;t give me grief about &ldquo;jammed full&rdquo; - 4 meetings today is waaay more than my average has been for the past several months. :-) )</p>
<p>Overall had a nice weekend; a busy Saturday included playing a pipe organ for a wedding, which was kinda cool. Any real organist present would&rsquo;ve recognized me for the hack organist that I am, though. My pedal skills are in the poor-to-non-existent spectrum. Also finished catching up on Harry Potter movies this weekend, and read a book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Room-Life-Lifestyles-Relationships/dp/0310250161/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-5447859-1897506?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188909757&amp;sr=8-1">Making Room For Life</a></em>, which was decent, but I guess I didn&rsquo;t find it as revolutionary and impacting as my friend (who bought it for me) did.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s on to a fairly busy week; looking forward to next weekend when the cooler temps arrive (highs around 70F! Woohoo!) and my folks and brother come to visit.</p>

			 <p>Becky and the girls stopped by my workplace for a few minutes this morning to drop off some lunch for me. As I sat in the van with them chatting for a few minutes, this conversation with Laura (3 years old) ensued:</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Yeah, Laura, I&rsquo;ve got to go back to work for a few hours&hellip;. but then I&rsquo;ll come home.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong>: And you&rsquo;ll go wee, wee, wee&hellip;. all the way back to my house?</p>
<p><em>[Becky chokes strangling laughter at this point.]</em></p>

			 <p>Well at least half of you who read this blog are already listening to this album, but I should still note that <a href="http://caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a> released their 15th album yesterday, entitled <em>Overdressed</em>. It marks the return of Derek Webb as a contributor to Caedmon&rsquo;s, though whether he&rsquo;s actually considered a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of the band is fuzzy to me at the moment&hellip; the word &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; has been used more, I think.</p>
<p>Christianity Today gave this album 5 out of 5 stars yesterday, and it deserves them. Good solid music and songwriting all the way around. My man <a href="http://andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> had a lot of influence on this album, and it&rsquo;s better off for it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in Overdressed, you can check out the info over on the <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/song-vault/">cc.net Song Vault</a>. Also, Bryan Allain has been doing some amazing liveblogging from the past few days and there are multiple videos, pictures, and inside info on songs available on <a href="http://caedmonscall.net">CaedmonsCall.net</a>. Go check it out. You can buy the album from their online store, too. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s available on iTunes yet, but it should be shortly.</p>

			 <p>How can it have been a week since I last posted? Well, it <em>has</em> been busy. So in the spirit of &ldquo;short updates are better than none&rdquo;, here we go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Airline travel can be a pain in the backside. After two canceled flights on Monday, flew to Seattle early Tuesday morning. Got to my committee meeting a couple of hours late.</li>
<li>Kudos to the hotel (the Hilton Garden Inn in Renton) for being nicely setup for wi-fi access; seamless transitions between the meeting room, lobby, and bedroom.</li>
<li>Got to see my college roommate Matt and his wife Abbie one evening. Had a good time catching up.</li>
<li>Got to meet my partner-in-crime TK for some breakfast and Starbucks on Thursday morning. Also took <a href="http://loverbyblood.wordpress.com/2007/08/23/some-updates/">a couple of cheesy pictures and some even cheesier video</a>.</li>
<li>Managed to leave a library book in my hotel room in Seattle. :-( They said they didn&rsquo;t find anything, but I&rsquo;m sure I left it there. I&rsquo;ll call again today and see if it turned up.</li>
<li>Finished the Harry Potter series while on the trip. The ending to Book 7 was almost perfect. The most I&rsquo;ve enjoyed a series of books in a long, long time.</li>
<li>Got home and had to mow the grass since it had been raining all week. It took twice a long as usual to mow. Ugh.</li>
<li>Preached on Sunday morning. <a href="http://www.noelridge.org/downloads/20070826.mp3">Audio available</a> if you&rsquo;re curious.</li>
<li>Talked to my brother Ryan last night for a little while. He&rsquo;s really having a tough time at the moment, wrestling with some tough decisions. Pray for him.</li>
<li>Caedmon&rsquo;s Call did their first show to release their new album, <em>Overdressed</em>, last night. There has been some <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2007/08/26/tonights-setlist/">seriously</a> <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2007/08/26/6-years-apartand-back-together-again/">great</a> <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2007/08/26/derek-andy-in-gods-country/">liveblogging</a> <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2007/08/26/the-closer-april-showers/">going</a> <a href="http://caedmonscall.net/2007/08/26/thoughts-on-the-release-show/">on</a>. (Go, <a href="http://www.bryanallain.com">Bryan</a>!) What I wouldn&rsquo;t give to have been there. At least it sounds like we&rsquo;ll get a bootleg from the concert sometime soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m now back in the office for six weeks before my next trip. It will be nice to settle into some sort of schedule.</p>

			 <p>Instead of sitting here writing this blog post, I should be on a Boeing 757 just taking off from Minneapolis <em>en route</em> to Seattle.  But you&rsquo;re reading this, which means I&rsquo;m writing it, which means yeah, I&rsquo;m not on the plane.  I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s weather or just general incompetence, but Northwest Airlines decided to cancel my 12:45 flight from Cedar Rapids to MSP.   I found this out around 10 AM, contacted travel, and got a rebooked flight on Alaska Airlines, leaving Cedar Rapids at 1:30.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the booking info, I checked online to see the departure status.  What? Canceled?!?  Yes, American Eagle (codesharing with Alaska Air) canceled the 1:30 flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago.  Back on the phone with corporate travel.  Everything was booked on all the remaining flights out of Cedar Rapids today.  Unbelievable.   Finally I am set up on a 5:10 AM flight tomorrow morning from CR.  If everything goes on time (a big if IMHO), I will get into Seattle around 9 AM Seattle time, and make it to my conference only an hour or so late.</p>
<p>Not fun.</p>

			 <p>I got my most recent pair of glasses about 6 years ago.  Now, I don&rsquo;t wear them all that often; my Focus Night and Day 30-day contact lenses have been my friends.  But still, there are times when I need or want to wear the glasses.  My existing pair is half-rim, and while they seemed at the time I bought them to be really small lenses, in reality they are still pretty big.  I&rsquo;ve been thinking of getting a new pair for a while now, but the opportunity hadn&rsquo;t presented itself.</p>
<p>This afternoon, though, I will be headed to visit my friend Roy who is an optician.  He says that the folks in his office can pick out the employees from my company just by the glasses they choose; engineers and nerds, all.  He has promised that the pair of glasses I end up with won&rsquo;t make me look like an engineer.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to the change.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s 8 AM in Seattle and this hotel restaurant is a pretty comfortable place to sit and write.  The in-room web access doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working, but the wi-fi in the lobby works just fine, so I can sit here and catch up on news and email whilst eating from the voluminous breakfast buffet.    It&rsquo;s fairly cloudy and cool this morning, but there&rsquo;s the threat of sunshine this afternoon, which would be nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in town to support a meeting with a customer, but it still leaves me with most of the morning (the meeting doesn&rsquo;t start until 11) and a good portion of the afternoon (the meeting is over by 2 or so) free.  Couldn&rsquo;t manage to get a flight back home tonight on short notice, so I&quot;ll be leaving on the early (5:45) flight in the morning.  Such fun.</p>
<p>This is my third trip to Seattle, and I really do enjoy the area.  So beautiful with the mountainous terrain, all the water, and I just adore the cool weather.  After the meetings today I&rsquo;m planning on heading downtown to the Pike Place Market; for sure a tourist location, but it&rsquo;s been recommended by a couple friends so I guess I&rsquo;ll give it a go.  I&rsquo;ll be sure to post pics tomorrow when I get home.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve pretty much finished up here at the restaurant so I think I&rsquo;ll move to the lobby, find a plug-in for this laptop, and start working on some work stuff.  Should be at least moderately productive today.  :-)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2007/08/09/new-orleans-music.html">New Orleans: Music and all that Jazz</a></h1>

			 <p>One of the things that was high on my list of things to do while in New Orleans a few weeks ago was to find someplace with live music. New Orleans is all about jazz and blues, after all. It was pretty wild to walk through the French Quarter and think that guys who are jazz heroes of mine like Harry Connick, Jr. and the Marsalis family spent time playing in the clubs on those streets. So very cool.</p>
<p>I headed around the Quarter rather early in the evening, which unfortunately cut down my number of opportunities to hear the live music. Most of it started later - 8 or 9 PM. However, I did hear a very good older band at a little bar that I am thinking was called something about the Society for the Preservation of Jazz; I can&rsquo;t find a link on a quick Google search to back me up. They played pretty good standard New Orleans jazz, but they were old-timers; nary a dark hair in the bunch - all grey.</p>
<p>As I headed back to my hotel, I ran into a group of about a dozen teenagers playing on the corner of Canal and Bourbon Streets. They were mostly brass instruments with a couple saxophones thrown in for good measure and a rockin' percussion section. And they were smokin' hot. My little video clip here really doesn&rsquo;t do them justice, and I&rsquo;m bummed that I didn&rsquo;t think to start recording them until just near the end of their set.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to think that one of these kids may be a jazz star of some upcoming year. While New Orleans took a massive hit from Hurricane Katrina, it sounded to me like she still couldn&rsquo;t kill the music.</p>

			 <p>So most of the recent posts here have been just links to other stuff. Sorry about that. Have been doing lots of reading lately, not so much writing. Most of my writing posts here have been of merely the logistical bullet-list variety. Today I have a random assortment that isn&rsquo;t entirely logistical, but is in a bullet-list; maybe there&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ll want to comment on, though.</p>
<p><em>[Voice in my head: &ldquo;you fool, you just fell victim to one of the classic blunders!&hellip;&rdquo; which is blogging about blogging&hellip; desperate, I know. Humor me.]</em></p>

<li>I still owe everybody a post on music in New Orleans. If I ever remember to up a little video to YouTube, I&rsquo;ll write the post.</li>
<li>Have you ever choked yourself by having saliva &ldquo;go down the wrong pipe&rdquo;? It just happened to me. Weird.</li>
<li>I have lately been listening to a series of lectures by Don Carson on the book of Revelation.

The amillenial viewpoint has always been a mystery to me (being raised a good dispensationalist and all), but Carson, along with a few things I&rsquo;ve heard from N. T. Wright, has given me the most reasonable case yet for that position. In a lot of ways it seems to make more sense. Anybody got a book recommendation that might help me think through it some more?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be traveling to Seattle in a couple weeks for an <a href="http://rtca.org/comm/Committee.cfm?id=68">industry committee meeting</a>. Gonna meet up with my old college roommate while I&rsquo;m there. Should be fun.</li>
<li>Immediately after I get back from the committee meeting I&rsquo;ll be preaching during our Sunday service at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>. Still trying to decide on a text.</li>
<li>Sorry, <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof</a>, I already have a web project lined up for my trip to Seattle. It doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with any <a href="http://squarepegalliance.com">Square Pegs</a>. :-)</li>
<li>Last but not least, congrats to my internet friend <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Dan</a> who is getting married this weekend!</li>
</ul>
<p>I told you it&rsquo;d be random.</p>
<p><em>Update, one too good to pass up:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I just watched my wife beat on a peppermint candy with her cell phone.  Hilarious.</li>

			 <p>Got back from last week&rsquo;s trip to New Orleans early on Friday morning. This was my first time in New Orleans, so it was interesting to see an area that I had heretofore only read about and seen on TV. I had a mix of impressions from the city.</p>
<p>The first night I was there I took a walk from my hotel over to the French Quarter. I mean, that&rsquo;s the place in New Orleans you&rsquo;re supposed to visit, right? It was only about a mile walk. On the way I passed a rather large Harrah&rsquo;s casino which I understand to be new development since Katrina two years ago. Didn&rsquo;t go in, but wow, that thing was big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/942104747/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/248b42ed1e.jpg" alt="IMG_5333"></a>The near edge of the French Quarter was Canal Street. It is big, glitzy, lots of neon and expensive shops. It reminded me a little bit of Michigan Avenue in Chicago. It&rsquo;s a big wide street that includes tracks for the streetcars. Once you walk up it for several blocks, you get to Bourbon Street. This is the one you always hear about during Mardi Gras, right? So I figured it&rsquo;s worth a visit.</p>
<p>In comparison to the broad, upscale Canal Street, Bourbon Street is narrow and scuzzy. There is very little variety to the shops on the street; the basic repeating pattern is souvenir shop, beer joint, strip club, restaurant. There may be a few extra beer joints mixed in for good measure - it&rsquo;s legal to have an open container on the street there, so there is a proliferation of lemonade-stand-type beer vendors. Eesh.</p>
<p>I <em>did</em> find some good food on Bourbon Street - the jambalaya from <a href="http://www.remoulade.com/home.html">Remoulade</a> was excellent (though the pecan pie left much to be desired). I almost bought one of <a href="http://www.remoulade.com/retail.html">their t-shirts</a> (I was thinking the Craw Dad one) but finally decided that I already have too many t-shirts, I don&rsquo;t need another one. Then I wandered up and down the street again looking for some good live music places. I found a couple, I&rsquo;ll write specifically about the music in a separate blog post. So yeah, I visited Bourbon Street. Suffice it to say I wasn&rsquo;t impressed. Seeing what it was like on an early Tuesday evening in the middle of summer, I can only imagine how much of a drunken orgy it is during Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>The last day of the trip I had a few hours before my flight so I drove east on I-10 towards Slidell and then up around Lake Ponchartrain and across the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ponchartrain_Causeway">Causeway</a> (longest bridge in the world!) back to New Orleans. I was astonished at how much damage is still left from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Even though it&rsquo;s been two full years since Katrina hit, the devastation is still painfully evident. Not so much in New Orleans proper, but once you get out on I-10 towards Slidell&hellip; wow. You would think that repair activities would&rsquo;ve focused on the areas around the interstate, but there is still so much damage&hellip; buildings boarded up, nice houses and apartments with tarps still over the roof; then you go past a field that obviously used to be mostly forest, and now it&rsquo;s just a field of 8-foot-tall trunks with the tops twisted off. So sad. Two full years later, and still this much mess?</p>
<p>Before I finish this post, a word about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ponchartrain_Causeway">Causeway</a>: amazing. Over 20 miles long. The visibility wasn&rsquo;t great that afternoon (a storm was rolling in), so there was definitely some time in the middle of the bridge when you couldn&rsquo;t see anything but water no matter which direction you looked. So cool.</p>
<p>So that was New Orleans. Next month: Seattle. Hoping to meet some old and new friends while I&rsquo;m up there.</p>

			 <p>Today through Thursday is the 2007 edition of the FAA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/air_software/conference/">SW/CEH DER Conference</a>. You can follow the link if you really want to know more about it; basically it&rsquo;s a technical conference for those of us who work with the FAA to approve aircraft equipment and software. Good times. This year, the conference is in New Orleans, LA. It&rsquo;s my first time in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The trip was a bit of a pain; my flights were from Cedar Rapids to Dallas/Fort Worth, and then from DFW to New Orleans. The first leg of the flight left about 40 minutes late, but no worries, I had a long-ish layover at DFW. Well, that long-ish layover turned into a very long layover, because my flight to New Orleans, supposed to arrive in NOLA at 9:20 PM, <em>didn&rsquo;t leave DFW</em> until 10:15 PM. It seems to be a recurring theme when I travel to these conferences; <a href="/06/06/atlanta-impressions/">last year</a> I was driving through downtown Atlanta at midnight to find the hotel, this year, through downtown New Orleans.</p>
<p>Day 1 of the conference is always rather boring; it&rsquo;s a general session where we get updates on the progress of various industry committees and information on what the FAA&rsquo;s doing. We got 45 minutes this morning on how they&rsquo;re gonna be using some new tools to do more uniform safety analyses of aircraft programs&hellip;. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Tomorrow and Thursday are more interesting when there are topical break-out sessions.</p>
<p>I just finished lunch at <a href="http://www.uglydogsaloon.net/">Ugly Dog Saloon</a>, recommended by <a href="http://www.rmfo-blogs.com/scott/">Scott</a> as the best BBQ in New Orleans. It <em>was</em> pretty tasty. Now I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m gonna skip the next couple committee updates and go walk through the <a href="http://www.riverwalkmarketplace.com/html/">Riverwalk</a> area across the street. Tonight I&rsquo;m meeting Scott and Jacob for dinner. Tomorrow night I guess I&rsquo;ll go hit the French Quarter and try to hear some live music. Should be fun.</p>

<li>We had three neighbors over for supper last night. It was quite a good time. And the pork loin that Becky did in the broiler was <em>delicious</em>.</li>
<li>The trip for the weekend will be to Lowe&rsquo;s for some blackjack for the roof and maybe a basin wrench.</li>
<li>We got an estimate on our tree in the front yard last night. It&rsquo;s developed a nasty split and if we don&rsquo;t do something soon we may lose some or all of it. Sounds like we can get it cabled up and should be able to save most of it.</li>
<li>Planning on just spending the weekend with the family. It will be nice to not have much to do.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m teaching Sunday School and leading worship at church on Sunday. Already have the music planned, but still have to prepare for the class.</li>
<li>Note to the FAA: planning a conference in New Orleans in July? Not such a bright idea. Ah well, I&rsquo;ll sweat along with the rest of them.</li>
<li>Got Harry Potter book 2 from the library yesterday. For some reason I got a LARGE PRINT copy. Ouch.</li>
<li>Today is my last day in my current position at work - after eight years, it&rsquo;s time for a change. Hoping it&rsquo;s a good move.</li>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a bit of a wet week here in eastern Iowa. We had storms starting Monday night through Tuesday, then again Wednesday morning and evening. My neighbor Jim told me yesterday that he measured something like 5 inches after the Monday/Tuesday storm. No big damage; the neighbors lost a small branch from their tree, that&rsquo;s about it. However, the split in our tree in the front yard is much more noticeable now than it was a couple of weeks ago, so we&rsquo;re gonna have a tree service come out and look at it to see what our options are. If the south side of the tree splits off, it&rsquo;ll fall on the house, right on Laura&rsquo;s room. Not good. So we will see. I&rsquo;d hate to lose that tree, though.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon we worked on outside stuff; I cleaned out the gutters and checked out a couple spots on the roof that I think are leaking a little. I&rsquo;ll be heading to Lowe&rsquo;s in the next day or two to check out my options for sealing up the leaks. Oh, and they need to make gutter guard with a solid top; the mesh guards do no good at filtering out the leaves from the locust tree and all the little messes that the oak tree makes.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my homeowner&rsquo;s report for the week. Still plenty to do on the house; my list of major things that&rsquo;ll need done in the next 5 - 7 years is pretty long. But hey, it&rsquo;s a good house, worth working on. God will provide as we have needs.</p>

<p>Dang, I had to ask that. Now I&rsquo;m gonna have to calculate them.</p>
<p>Probability of a winner is 1 in 8. So the chances of me getting a winner with my first bottle was, well, 1 in 8, or 0.125.</p>
<p>Probability of a winner each time I get 2 bottles is [1 in 8] * 2, which is 1 in 4, or 0.25.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now gotten the initial winner plus three more winners in sequence. The odds of that, according to these back-of-the-envelope calculations, are 0.125 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.001953125, or to put it another way, 1 in 512.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week Becky and I had a discussion about, well, a bunch of things, but the one thing that came out of it was an agreement that we needed to be inviting people over more. We enjoy having folks over to share a meal, play games, and hang out, but we do it far too rarely. So we discussed for a while what day would work best for us, (if we want to be consistent, we&rsquo;re gonna have to pick a day and stick to it), and came up with Sunday evenings. We don&rsquo;t have any Sunday evening church activities, and, we concluded, but 5 PM on Sunday we&rsquo;re usually bored anyway and looking for something to do, so why not have folks over for supper? Having thus planned, we invited two couples (+ kids) over, and started preparing for Sunday night.</p>
<p>Now, normally for something like this we&rsquo;d do a lot of meal preparation and house cleaning on Saturday, leaving us time on Sunday to rest and relax before having visitors. (I <em>do</em> love my Sunday afternoons to crash.) But this past Saturday was a softball tournament that went from first thing in the morning until mid-afternoon, and then left us so tired we had no motivation to start cleaning. &ldquo;We still have tomorrow to get ready&rdquo; was our motto.</p>
<p>So Sunday afternoon rolled around and it was time to get ready. So we picked up toys, vacuumed, snapped green beans, made lasagna, did the dishes, put the leaves in the table, and next thing you know, it was 5 PM and our guests were arriving. So much for our theory that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re bored by 5 PM anyway&hellip;&rdquo;! 5 PM showed up and we hadn&rsquo;t sat down all afternoon. Well, not quite true. I sat down to rip a few sermon recordings to mp3 for the church website. But that was it.</p>
<p>We had a great time with our guests last night. We ate plenty of good food, finished up with some to-die-for homemade chocolate-mint ice cream, sat around and swapped stories about growing up in small towns, raising kids, and protecting our homes from late-night marauding insects, and laughed hilariously at <a href="http://andrew-peterson.blogspot.com/2007/07/special-guest.html">this video</a> of Ringo Starr visiting the studio as <a href="http://andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> is recording his new album. Look for the cameo appearance by Chris Sligh (formerly of <a href="http://americanidol.com">American Idol</a>) and Ringo&rsquo;s quick wit when Chris declares himself &ldquo;more of a Paul man&rdquo;. (<a href="http://andygullahorn.com">Andy Gullahorn</a> is a genius, I tell you! A genius!) Time flew by, and by the time folks were leaving to get kids to bed and prepare for the upcoming week, it was nearing 9 PM. It was a wonderful evening.</p>
<p>Now I know that our guests from last night pretty much all read my blog (hi Roy, Bridget, Dave, and Barb!), so I want to say this up front: we had a great time, and practicing hospitality this way is absolutely something we needed to do and to continue to do. However, yeah, it was a challenge. First of all, we need our Sunday rest, and it was pretty well lacking yesterday. I will also admit to being kinda frustrated yesterday when it became apparent about 3:30 that there was no way we were gonna have time to sit and crash before folks came. So we need to make sure that we use our Saturday more effectively next time. Becky and I also need to make sure that we communicate our expectations well; when I&rsquo;m thinking and working towards one thing and she&rsquo;s got something different in mind, and then the time crunch hits, well, it has the opportunity to not be a lot of fun. We&rsquo;re still learning this communication thing after 9 years of marriage.</p>
<p>What I will conclude from the weekend, though:</p>
<p>We need to continue the hospitality. Dinners with friends are a lot of fun. Chocolate-mint ice cream can be really, really good. We need some time for Sunday rest. The Cubs still managed to win without me watching them. Sleep is sweet.</p>
<p>(Oh, and that Andy Gullahorn is a genius.)</p>

			 <p>Yesterday <a href="http://simplehelp.net">SimpleHelp.net</a> posted <a href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/07/08/10-alternatives-to-itunes-for-managing-your-ipod/">10 Alternatives to iTunes for managing your iPod</a>. (They have since <a href="http://digg.com/software/10_Alternatives_to_iTunes_for_managing_your_iPod">been dugg</a> and their website is down. Bummer. You can still see the guts of the article from the <a href="http://72.14.209.104/search?hs=sUq&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.simplehelp.net%2F2007%2F07%2F08%2F10-alternatives-to-itunes-for-managing-your-ipod%2F&amp;btnG=Search">Google cache</a>.)</p>
<p>At my work location iTunes is <em>verboten</em>, so I&rsquo;m all for exploring other ways to manage my iPod, or at least to play the tunes off of it while I&rsquo;m at work. Here are my basic requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It needs to run smoothly. (Duh.)</li>
<li>It needs to be Windows-based. (No Macs or Linux boxes here.)</li>
<li>It needs to support the AAC audio format. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of .m4c files on my iPod.</li>
<li>It shouldn&rsquo;t be a system hog.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to have&rsquo;s would include portability, support for <a href="http://last.fm">Last.FM</a> and the ability to copy songs off the iPod back to the PC.</p>
<p>There are 5 alternatives on the SimpleHelp site that are available for the Windows platform. Here are my reviews of them:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.floola.com/modules/wiwimod/">Floola</a></strong></p>
<p>This was the first one, and at first glance was a strong contender. It has support for Last.FM, is portable, and has a pretty nice UI. Once I got it installed, though, I found some issues. Even though it appears to support proxy servers, I never could get it to talk to Last.FM. Secondly, the thing was a system hog - regularly freezing up for 30 - 60 seconds at a time when I tried to do anything. No thanks. And then the kicker: no support for AAC. Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Add or Remove Programs -&gt; Uninstall.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mediamonkey.com/">MediaMonkey</a></strong></p>
<p>Gave this one a try next. The install was quick, the software came up quickly, and it immediately recognized my iPod. Off to a good start! Didn&rsquo;t seem to hog the system too much. Tried to play an AAC file&hellip; no joy. Skipped three albums in the playlist before it got to one that was .mp3 format. So much for that. Uninstall.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a></strong></p>
<p>When I downloaded this one, it warned me that it was just a developer&rsquo;s version, that there isn&rsquo;t an official release of Songbird yet. Well, I&rsquo;m brave, so I gave it a try. This is definitely the slickest one yet - good graphics all the way around (icons, skins, etc). This one is built on the Mozilla browser platform, so it has way more overhead than a player really should - about 60 MB installed. Then I had to install a plugin to get it to recognize my iPod. Once I got the plugin installed, it found the iPod fine, but then I had to wait for it to load the library. So I waited. And waited. And waited some more.</p>
<p>It must have taken Songbird about 45 minutes to load the library information from my 25 GB media library. Still, if that was a one-time startup thing, I can live with it. And it appears that it is - though who knows if it&rsquo;ll have to do a full library re-scan when I change something? No telling. I was about sold on Songbird until I actually started playing music from it. AAC support? Yep. But as I played the songs, it hiccuped my audio on a fairly regular basis - every 15 seconds or so. This wasn&rsquo;t due to CPU spiking - I had plenty of free CPU left - so there must be some inefficiency in the program itself. Uninstall.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sturm.net.nz/website.php?Section=iPod+Programs&amp;Page=SharePodLib">SharePod</a></strong></p>
<p>The UI on this one appears to be a lot more barebones than some of the other contenders. The sorting options are bad; you can sort only by one field at a time (artist, album, etc), but then it doesn&rsquo;t sort below that. For instance, I can sort by artist to get all of U2 grouped together&hellip; but then there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the U2 albums will be grouped together. Given that I&rsquo;m a guy who likes to listen to a whole album at a time, this is no good for me. Still, I should give it a try, right?</p>
<p>So I gave it a whirl with some .mp3-formatted files. The sound was OK, the playback controls simple but marginally adequate. Then I went to AAC. It won&rsquo;t play AAC. Not only that, it doesn&rsquo;t give you an error, or skip the tracks, or anything - it just sits there on the file and acts like it wants to play it, but it won&rsquo;t play it. Unacceptable. Uninstall. Wait, don&rsquo;t have to uninstall - this one is totally portable. Thank God for small mercies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.yamipod.com">YamiPod</a></strong></p>
<p>I left this one for last because it wasn&rsquo;t new to me - I&rsquo;ve been running YamiPod for a few years now, but only for the ability to be able to pull files back off the iPod onto the PC. I&rsquo;m not real find of the UI, but it works, which is way more than I can say for some of these I&rsquo;ve evaluated.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually tried to play anything back on it until just now. So let&rsquo;s give it a try.</p>
<p>Amazing. It won&rsquo;t play any of the files. What&rsquo;s going on? Controls seem unresponsive, it&rsquo;s not playing anything back. Well phooey on that. At least it&rsquo;s portable, and it&rsquo;ll copy files off the iPod neatly. I&rsquo;ll keep it around just for that.</p>
<p><strong>Winamp</strong> Winamp hasn&rsquo;t been allowed on my office network computers for at least 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>Each of these alternative players has their strong and weak points, but when it comes down do it, none of them were good enough for me to use as a regular player. I will keep waiting for the Windows version of <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a>; right now it&rsquo;s Linux-only, but there&rsquo;s a Windows version coming, and <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Dan</a> swears that it&rsquo;s the greatest thing since sliced bread.</p>
<p>Until then, I&rsquo;ll keep using <a href="http://foobar2000.org">Foobar2000</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t manage my iPod; I have to point it to the Control directory of the iPod and then have it just search for files. But it plays consistently, manages playlists nicely, and has a Last.FM plugin. So, it&rsquo;s a keeper. And I guess I&rsquo;ll keep using iTunes at home. It&rsquo;s a resource hog sometimes, but it does what it needs to.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday morning I was awake early so I went to the gym and hit the treadmill and the weight machines. I have been doing at least a bit of running, so the treadmill part wasn&rsquo;t bad; however, I haven&rsquo;t hit the weights in two or three months, so this morning I find myself pretty sore. It&rsquo;s a good kind of soreness, though - feels good to know that I actually did something.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve pretty much been a slacker the last couple of months in going to the gym - time to get it cranked up again. Need to break the weight plateau I&rsquo;ve been at for the last 4 or 5 months and get to losing some more pounds.</p>

			 <p>Well, it was a busy weekend. The whole family showed up Friday night for one last get together before we head our separate ways this fall. The result was two days of playing cards, music, football, and making at least one obligatory Hubbs shopping trip to Walmart and Sam&rsquo;s Club. Aaron and Andrew also got haircuts&hellip; Andrew opting for the &ldquo;I wanna look like Chris&rdquo; haircut. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll be maintaining his, though, so he should have hair again by the time he gets out out to Oregon.</p>
<p>Hit the gym this morning to run and do a little lifting, and yeah, it feels good to be sore again. I&rsquo;ve been too much of a slacker the past couple of months. Gotta get back to it. The pounds don&rsquo;t lose themselves.</p>

			 <p>Having a day off from work in the middle of the week has totally thrown me off. Yesterday seemed like Saturday all day, which meant that I kept going into a panic about not being ready for church the next day&hellip; no music picked, Sunday School lesson not prepared&hellip; I had to keep reminding myself, wait, Chris, tomorrow is only Thursday&hellip; you still have time. So last night I picked the music. The Sunday School lesson is still waiting.</p>
<p>Had a good time up in Troy Mills yesterday with the Marsceau family and some assorted friends as we watched the parade, enjoyed Grandma Hazel&rsquo;s fried chicken, and sat around visiting. Then last night got some work done around the house in preparation for my family coming to visit this weekend. My sister is heading back to Panama for several months and so we&rsquo;re getting together to have one more weekend as a family before she leaves. We&rsquo;ll be pretty scattered this fall, what with Andrew heading west to Portland (attending <a href="http://www.georgefox.edu">George Fox</a>) and Ryan heading east to DC (grad school at <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu">Georgetown</a>). Ah, well, we couldn&rsquo;t all stay in the Midwest forever.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s off to a slow day at work&hellip; there will be a lot of people taking the rest of the week off. At least, as <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof Morris</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/gfmorris/statuses/135497842">just reminded</a> <a href="http://raewhitlock.com">a friend</a>, tomorrow is Friday. :-)</p>

			 <p>Becky and I arrived back home late in the evening Saturday.  Travel was uneventful, though we did have a long-ish layover (4.5 hours) in Minneapolis.  But hey, we got home, so no complaints.  It was a fun trip, quite relaxing and enjoyable.  I might post a few pictures to Flickr here when I get a chance, but it looks like they&rsquo;re mostly of the beach, and all the beach pictures tend to look the same before long.  There <em>are</em> a couple night-time ones that came out pretty well - gotta love the new DSLR camera.  :-)</p>

			 <p>Last night Becky and I went to see <a href="http://blueman.com/">Blue Man Group</a> over at Universal Orlando. BMG is one of those acts that&rsquo;s very hard to describe to folks who haven&rsquo;t heard of them before. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s three guys. And they&rsquo;re all blue. And they do stuff with drums&hellip; and paint&hellip;&rdquo; You see? That makes no sense at all, does it?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ballet-dance.com/200507/articles/images/BlueManGroupArmsPaintmed.jpg" alt="Blue Man Group"></p>
<p>So last night we had tickets that put us in row 3, the &ldquo;poncho&rdquo; area. That&rsquo;s right, there are plastic ponchos on each seat and yeah, you ought to wear them. It truly is the &ldquo;spray zone&rdquo;. The show was a mix of loud music, sweet drumming, and humor. The Blue Men never say anything, but the show is narrated by an unseen voice. They did a few hilarious &ldquo;skits&rdquo;, and they often pulled audience members up to participate. The one girl did so well that I have a hard time believing she wasn&rsquo;t a plant - no way a random person does so well in an improvisational scene. But still, it was quite enjoyable. We laughed a lot, went &ldquo;wow&rdquo; several times, and left the show bleary-eyed but pleased. Oh, and Dad, if you read this: you&rsquo;d get a real kick out of the trombonish instrument they made out of PVC pipe. Pretty cool. Here&rsquo;s the picture as they&rsquo;re trying to assemble it:</p>

			 <p>Hard to believe it&rsquo;s been that long already. Nine years ago tonight, on a hot, sticky night in Charlotte, NC, Becky and I exchanged our vows and became Mr. and Mrs. Chris Hubbs. (Our first stop after the wedding was in a Home Depot parking lot that had an available dumpster, but that&rsquo;s a different story.) God has blessed us greatly, and it&rsquo;s been a wonderful nine years.</p>
<p>So today we are celebrating in Orlando. Becky woke up at 2:45 CDT this morning to finish getting ready so she could catch her 5 AM flight from Cedar Rapids to Minneapolis, and from there she headed down here to Orlando. I picked her up at the airport about 1 PM. We grabbed a little lunch and then came back to the hotel. I think she spent some time at the pool while I grudgingly attended the afternoon&rsquo;s technical sessions at <a href="http://www.freescale.com/ftf/">the conference</a>.</p>
<p>Tonight we ate dinner at <a href="http://ruthschris.com">Ruth&rsquo;s Chris Steakhouse</a>. It was my first time at a Ruth&rsquo;s Chris, and given the price I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to eat there very often even if there was one close to Cedar Rapids. That being said, tonight I had what was hands-down the best steak I have ever had in my life. It was a filet, cooked medium, and just the smell of it on that sizzling plate as it came to the table was almost worth the purchase price. I will say this: Ruth&rsquo;s Chris knows how to do service right. When we made the reservation online, the form asked if it was a special occasion, and I noted that it was our anniversary. From the time we arrived at the restaurant and gave our name, each staff member who spoke with us first wished us a happy anniversary. Then they gave us dessert &ldquo;on the house&rdquo;. It was tasty, too. Bravo, Ruth&rsquo;s Chris of Orlando.</p>
<p>Two more days of conference and then we have two days on the beach before heading home. Nice.</p>

			 <p>Made it with no serious travel glitches to Orlando about 7:30 pm local time. Gotta say this - that iPod with video capability is pretty great. I loaded Season One of Battlestar Galactica on it and made it through the first two episodes before my ears got sore from the headphones. You can bet I&rsquo;ll watch some more this week. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Got my rental car (a 2007 Mustang, pretty spiffy, though a little lacking in the headroom department) and found a restaurant to stop for some dinner before heading to the hotel. I guess hotel is really the wrong word - this thing is <a href="http://www.grandelakes.com/jw_marriott/jw_marriott.cfm">a full-blown resort/convention center</a>. Got a good room without a hitch, finished my week&rsquo;s worth of ironing, now I&rsquo;m gonna finish a book and try to convince my body that it&rsquo;s really almost 11 pm instead of the 10 pm that it is back at home.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning should be fairly slow, no meetings until 11 AM and then just afternoon sessions. Good times.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m getting ready to go sit in an all-day meeting with some customers that are in town. Not real exciting, but should be some good discussion. Mostly it&rsquo;s just looooong. At least food is provided. :-)</p>
<p>Ordered a case for my new iPod yesterday; it&rsquo;s the one that Tony recommended to me the other day. I expected that if I ordered early on Monday morning that I had a good shot at 3-5 day UPS shipping getting it here to me before I leave for Florida on Sunday. But as of this morning it still hasn&rsquo;t shipped. If I don&rsquo;t see some movement by noon today, I&rsquo;m gonna talk to Tony and get one back-channel.</p>
<p>Went to Texas Roadhouse last night with the family and my mom and sister who are in town visiting. Didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d eaten too much last night, but this morning I can feel it. :-(</p>
<p>My Florida trip is coming up in less than a week. Orlando. We have tickets to see Blue Man Group, Becky&rsquo;s going to Sea World one day while I&rsquo;m at my conference, and then we have a hotel on the beach for a couple nights before we come home. And the girls are staying with my folks. 5 more days&hellip;</p>

			 <p>So for it being a weekend, it was a busy one. A synopsis:</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ran a 5k in the morning. Finished in 31:33. It was stinkin' hot outside.</li>
<li>Sat and watched the parade go by. With two cute little girls, you get a lot of candy.</li>
<li>Watched the girls while Becky went to a baby shower.</li>
<li>Went to church for an all-evening elder meeting. Boy will I be glad when this is over.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To church, but didn&rsquo;t have to lead music - only taught Sunday School. Good times.</li>
<li>Got a couple very sweet Father&rsquo;s Day cards and a couple of t-shirts. My favorite: the one that says &ldquo;Those who think they know everything annoy those of us that actually do.&rdquo; Hehe.</li>
<li>Crashed some in the afternoon, then cleaned house to prepare for my mom and sister coming to visit.</li>
<li>Watched <em>Cinderella Man</em> for the first time. Russell Crowe, for all his personal problems, is a heckuva actor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday and back to work. But one week from today I will be in Orlando, FL, on Day 1 of my week-long conference/vacation. Ahhhhhh. I think I can make it one more week.</p>

			 <p>Well if I&rsquo;m gonna gripe when I think things have gone wrongly, it is only right that I applaud when I feel that justice has been done.  :-)</p>
<p>I made my trip to Best Buy this afternoon with my second defective refurbished iPod.  I had been steeling myself for this visit, preparing to ask to speak to a manager if necessary.  (I&rsquo;m really bad at confrontation, but this has been getting ridiculous.)  I went back to the Geek Squad counter and talked to one of their employees (one I hadn&rsquo;t spoken to before).</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say much at all: &ldquo;long story.  This is the second refurb I&rsquo;ve gotten, and it doesn&rsquo;t work, either.&rdquo;  I explained the issue - the thing wouldn&rsquo;t sync with the PC - it locked up after only 1 GB of transfer.  He said &ldquo;let me check something real quick&hellip;&rdquo; and headed off to a computer backstage.  He came back a couple of minutes later with some good news.  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get  you a new iPod.  That should make sure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;  FINALLY!  So I went off to the iPod counter, requested a 30 GB black iPod, and headed over to Customer Service for the cashier to ring up the transaction.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets better.  They weren&rsquo;t just gonna give me a straight exchange for a new 30 GB iPod (which in itself would&rsquo;ve been an upgrade from the 20 GB iPod that I took in originally) - they were essentially just gonna refund back the $299 I paid for that old iPod and then credit it to me.  When I realized <em>that</em> was the case, I suggested that I would instead like to take that $299 credit and apply it to a $349 <strong>80 GB</strong> iPod.  The cashier was amenable to the idea, so I headed back to the iPod counter, got the 80 GB unit, and paid $50 from my pocket to get the new iPod.  As a little bonus, Best Buy&rsquo;s promotion this week gives you a $30 Best Buy gift card with the purchase of said iPod, so I got that as well.</p>
<p>As I sit here tonight typing this up, iTunes has copied over 622 of 5773 songs onto the new iPod. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll sit up to wait for the sync to complete&hellip;  but I will sure enjoy having an iPod back.  Thank you, Best Buy, for finally getting this right.</p>

			 <p>UPS dutifully delivered my second refurbished iPod this afternoon. The battery was pretty well dead, so I hooked it up to the wall charger for a few hours until it said it was all charged up. Then I hooked it up to the laptop, setup iTunes to sync 18 GB of music, and crossed my fingers. Would this one work?</p>
<p>No. iTunes claims that it&rsquo;s synced about 350 songs, and then it gives a file write error and dies. I tried removing the song that it died on from the sync list and syncing again, still no joy. The iPod totally locks up, has to be reset, and doesn&rsquo;t end up with more than the first 11 tracks of the first album on it. Now, I like Bach&rsquo;s <em>Brandenburg Concertos</em>, but I&rsquo;m gonna need the iPod to hold more than that.</p>
<p>So I guess it&rsquo;s <em>back</em> to Best Buy tomorrow for yet another return. I&rsquo;m not good at being confrontational in the store - usually I figure that the person behind the counter doesn&rsquo;t have much control over it, so why be hard on them? But this time I won&rsquo;t wait long before asking to see a manager. I waited two weeks for this second refurb, and it turned out to be trash, too. I want a gift card. I know their policy says I need to get <em>another</em> lemon before I get a gift card, but I really don&rsquo;t want to have to wait <em>another</em> two weeks just to find out whether the next one is any good.</p>
<p>Grrrrrrr.</p>

			 <p>So, <a href="/2007/06/i-just-want-my-ipod-back/">as planned</a>, tonight I went to Best Buy to find out what was up with my iPod replacement. Long story short, I took my original one in for repair, they sent me a refurb which was also dead, so I took it back, and they were going to send me another one. Two weeks elapse. We pick up on the story tonight as I talk to a member of the &ldquo;Geek Squad&rdquo; at our local Cedar Rapids Best Buy.</p>
<p>I explain my story. I brought in the refurb for the second return 12 days ago. The guy wasn&rsquo;t able to enter it into the system yet, but assured me the system would let him enter it by the end of the day, so 3 - 5 business days and I should get a new one. 8 business days later, I&rsquo;m back. I talked to them last Friday on the phone and they said yeah, the service tag just closed, so expect the iPod in a couple of days. Three days later, still nada.</p>
<p>So the guy looks it up in the computer and finally says &ldquo;I think they sent it here by mistake. Let me go look.&rdquo; So he goes into the back room, and eventually comes out&hellip; <em>with the refurb I returned 12 days ago</em>. And then he goes to explain. Yeah, they couldn&rsquo;t enter it into the system until the previous service ticket closed. And the previous service ticket didn&rsquo;t close until June 8th. It ends up the way their return software is designed, <em>the service ticket doesn&rsquo;t close until the one I sent back in is repaired and returned to store stock</em>. Absolutely ridiculous! So my returned iPod has just been sitting there on the shelf for the last 12 days, with nothing happening.</p>
<p>I can draw a couple conclusions from this: First, the guy who told me he could have the service ticket entered &ldquo;by the end of the day&rdquo; was lying to me. Certainly he knew how the system worked. He just wanted to get me out the door. Second, they have some very poorly designed software. You telling me they didn&rsquo;t think about this case where a refurb is itself bad? Or did they think about it and dismiss it as an acceptable error? Either way is unacceptable.</p>
<p>So now I have a new service ticket in hand, and can expect another refurbished iPod to be delivered via UPS in 3 - 5 business days. If <em>that</em> one is bad and requires a return, I&rsquo;ll be interested to hear how soon they tell me they can enter it into the system&hellip; I won&rsquo;t be too accepting of another two-week wait just to get a return into the system again.</p>

			 <p>After <a href="/07/05/ipod-replacement-a-for-effort-d-for-results/">BestBuy&rsquo;s impressive performance</a> in getting me my first refurbished iPod, it has now been 12 days since I was promised my <em>next</em> refurbished iPod, and I still don&rsquo;t have a replacement. I called the &ldquo;Geek Squad&rdquo; representative last Friday; he looked it up on the computer and assured me that my second service ticket had just closed out on Friday, so I should expect my iPod in &ldquo;one to two&rdquo; days, and if not, I should contact him.</p>
<p>I decided to be gracious and assume that he meant &ldquo;one to two <em>business</em> days&rdquo;, seeing as UPS doesn&rsquo;t typically deliver on Saturday or Sunday. So I waited. No UPS man yesterday. We already have a shopping trip planned to that side of town for this evening; if I don&rsquo;t get that iPod via UPS today I will be making a stop back at Best Buy tonight. I&rsquo;ll be curious to see what line they&rsquo;ll feed me - I certainly won&rsquo;t be happy with &ldquo;wait a couple more days&rdquo; - at a minimum I&rsquo;ll want a UPS tracking number or something to prove that my iPod has actually shipped. I&rsquo;d really love it if they&rsquo;d say &ldquo;oops, something went wrong - can we just give you a merchandise credit for the original price of your iPod?&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much chance that&rsquo;ll happen. Oh, if it did, though? I&rsquo;d put another $50 with it and get the 80GB iPod with video&hellip; Oh well, at least a guy can hope, right?</p>

			 <p>We were sitting in a conference room at work the other day and there was a large pad that someone had written on in a previous meeting. I don&rsquo;t know the context of the meeting or the notes on the pad, but what was written on the pad was this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>Energetic</li>
<li>Sociable</li>
<li>Responsible</li>
<li>Respectful</li>
<li>Flexible</li>

<p>We took a minute to be amused at it, and then one of my co-workers asked &ldquo;so what word shall we add?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all thought about it a second, and another co-worker chimed in, &ldquo;Inflatable?&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>So just as I was about to get <em>really</em> frustrated with Qwest, UPS showed up with their &ldquo;welcome letter&rdquo; and login details about 5 PM Tuesday. It was easy enough to set up the DSL modem; they&rsquo;ve actually streamlined their install process quite a bit in the last couple of years. Good deal.</p>
<p>Then I went to hook up my existing wireless router to it. No luck. Hooked it back up hardware, did some Googling, and found out that yeah, it&rsquo;s potentially possible, but not simple, to get my D-Link router to work with their ActionTec DSL modem. :-( Rather than fight with it for hours that I don&rsquo;t have, I went back to Best Buy, returned the DSL modem, and bought the DSL modem that is wireless-equipped. So, I&rsquo;m out $50, but I can probably sell the D-Link to recoup part of that cost.</p>
<p>Back home with the right piece of hardware, it took mere minutes to have my wireless network back up and running. I&rsquo;ll have to relocate the DSL modem this weekend; I really want it in the basement by the PC down there, but I can&rsquo;t find the phone line. I stowed it up somewhere during the cleanup effort after the <a href="/07/01/the-great-new-years-eve-flood-of-aught-six/">Great New Year&rsquo;s Eve Flood of Aught-Six</a>, and now it doesn&rsquo;t want to be found. Still, it&rsquo;s good to be back online. I&rsquo;m also happy with the DSL speed - cable sure wasn&rsquo;t supporting 100 Kbps uploads!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worse when I have things I&rsquo;m waiting for and impatient to get. In my current case, I&rsquo;m waiting for two things. First, the Qwest DSL hookup information, which I had been anticipating last week Thursday. They promise it will get here today. It better. Second, my (second) refurbished iPod. I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed that the guy at Best Buy remembered to put it into the system promptly; some time this week UPS should deliver another refurb; hopefully it has less problems than the last one did.</p>
<p>So for now I sit and wait, knowing that patience is a virtue that should be cultivated. I&rsquo;m trying to learn.</p>

<li>We got 3 tons of sand dumped on our driveway Friday afternoon; my back is now sore from moving two of those tons back to the girls' sandbox in the backyard with a wheelbarrow. The third ton was apparently unnecessary; sounds like the garden center gave us a bad number on how much sand was required. Still trying to decide what to do with the sand in the driveway. Anybody need a ton of sand?</li>
<li>Satellite TV: so far, so good. The picture is crystal clear. Had one short (a few seconds) signal drop-out when a big storm came over, but in my book that&rsquo;s acceptable.</li>
<li>Satellite DVR: sure as heck isn&rsquo;t TiVo. It&rsquo;s nice to have a dual tuner so you can record one show while watching another one. However, I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out how to get the darn thing to let me explicitly pick which tuner I want to record which show. Might have found it on the internet if not for&hellip;</li>
<li>No internet all weekend. Note to Qwest: if you&rsquo;re gonna promise hookup in three business days, make it happen. I signed up for DSL on Monday evening and got a confirmation email from them that night. I figured I was in good shape to have the DSL hooked up by the time the Dish guy came on Friday to install. On Saturday, still nothing from Qwest. As I was about to call them, they called me to confirm a service order to hook it up by&hellip; next Tuesday. So three business days ends up being more like five or six. Grrrr. But we survived.</li>
<li>Busy Sunday. Led music. But we&rsquo;re consolidating to one service for the summer, so that makes it easier. Amazingly easier. Also taught my first week of a Sunday School class on Christian Basics. Should be fun.</li>

			 <p>My <a href="/07/05/ipod-the-continuing-saga/">refurbished iPod</a> showed up via UPS late yesterday afternoon. I have to give Best Buy full marks for sending a quick replacement; they said 3 - 5 business days, and it ended up being only two. They sent an iPod identical to the one I had before (20 GB 4G, white), though they had obviously cleaned this one up, buffed out the scratches, etc. It looked good.</p>
<p>So last night I hooked it up to the laptop to reload the 4100 songs that belong on my iPod. The first time I tried a sync I got a weird Windows delayed write error. Strange, I thought; maybe I just jiggled the cord at the wrong time or something. So I tried again. The second time, it managed to sync about 2 GB worth of music, then stopped syncing. When I disconnected it and tried to play the music from the iPod, uh oh. The iPod didn&rsquo;t show any music on it at all. When I reconnected it to the PC, it gave me a nasty error and told me that I would need to re-download the iPod firmware and reset it.</p>
<p>At least running iPod firmware updates isn&rsquo;t so tough these days; it did make me dig up my wall power charger, but I found that and completed the reset. Then I set it up to sync again. As I watched it gallantly attempt to copy the music, I started listning to the iPod - not to the music, but to the device itself, and discovered that the hard drive in it sounds sick. It&rsquo;s clicking too much, spinning up and then quickly spinning down; I think I found the source of the problem. Again the sync died after 2 GB of transfer; this time it shows that the songs are there, but it locks up if I actually try to play any of them.</p>
<p>So after work this afternoon I will be heading back to BestBuy with my refurbished iPod (still in box) and my service plan paperwork (still conveniently accessible - hadn&rsquo;t refiled it yet). I am sure they will have me send it in and get yet <em>another</em> refurbished one. I can only hope it goes better than this one did. I think I have to have three replacements die before they&rsquo;ll actually just give me store credit. :-( I&rsquo;d be happy enough just to have one that works.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of months since I did the math and realized that Mediacom was no longer a good deal for our household. Let&rsquo;s review. Mediacom provides us digital cable and high-speed internet. They have repeatedly raised prices over the last two years (including a $10/month upper over the past 3 months). They had a real pain-in-the-backside dispute with Sinclair that caused us to lose one of our local channels for a month. We chose to go to Mediacom two years ago now when we dropped our home landline and went to cell phones-only; at that point, Qwest didn&rsquo;t have the option of getting DSL without having a land line, which priced their service out of our range.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Qwest now has the option of getting DSL even if you don&rsquo;t have regular phone service. Dish Network has an option that will give me pretty much all the same channels I have now. I&rsquo;ll get a few added benefits from Dish like a dual-DVR system. (The one downer about Dish? I don&rsquo;t get Versus in the top-200 channel pack, which means I won&rsquo;t get to see much NHL next year. But heck, for what I&rsquo;m saving per month, I could order NHL Center Ice next season and still save money.) When all is said and done, we&rsquo;ll save $35/month for the first year, then when the Dish discount expires, we&rsquo;ll be saving $25/month. That is, as Bullwinkle J. Moose says, antihistimine money. (&ldquo;Antihistimine money?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not to be sneezed at.&quot;)</p>
<p>So for Qwest DSL, you can either buy the DSL modem for $50, or you can lease it for $5/month <em>ad infinitum</em>, or you can get one from Best Buy. Normally I&rsquo;d assume Best Buy would be the worst deal of them all. But Best Buy has this deal where if you sign up for Qwest DSL while you&rsquo;re at the store, you get the DSL modem for free. That&rsquo;s right, free. No mail-in rebate; they just walk you through the online signup, then they take the modem, throw it in a bag, and hand it to you. I was amazed. The signup went smoothly, appears to have made it to Qwest OK (I got a confirmation email last night), and it&rsquo;s definitely the same DSL package I would&rsquo;ve signed up for if I signed up directly from Qwest. So good on you, Best Buy. Now if I get my refurbished iPod yet this week and it&rsquo;s satisfactory, Best Buy will be on my &ldquo;very good&rdquo; list for the week.</p>
<p>Tonight I&rsquo;ll stop by the satellite TV place on the way home and put in my order for Dish. When I checked with them a few weeks back, the lead time on installs was only a couple of days. I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll get an install Friday afternoon or Saturday. I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed that it all goes smoothly.</p>

			 <p>Took my iPod with the bad battery and service plan back to Best Buy today.  They have to send it in for service, and gave me the option of either having my iPod serviced in about 2 weeks, or in the quick replacement plan where they send me a similar iPod, refurbished, right away - i.e. 3 - 5 business days.  I opted for the latter option - the quicker the better, and I&rsquo;m not tied to my particular piece of hardware - I just want something that works.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping it ends up being more like 3 business days instead of 5, but then, I&rsquo;m just awfully impatient sometimes.  We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had my 3G 20GB iPod for two and a half years now, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that the battery was about due to go.  Well, it pretty well happened last week; I could charge it overnight and still not get more than about 30 minutes worth of play out of it.  :-(</p>
<p>When I bought the iPod, I shelled out an extra $50 for the 3-year service plan, since the Best Buy associate assured me that it would cover replacing the battery, and I knew that batteries were the iPod&rsquo;s weakness.  So when I get a chance this weekend I will be heading to Best Buy to see what they&rsquo;ll offer me for service options.  I think it&rsquo;s unlikely that they&rsquo;d just offer me a replacement, though if they wanted to offer me $300 towards a new iPod I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t complain.  More likely they&rsquo;ll tell me I have to send it in for service and be without it for a month.  Ugh.  I guess I&rsquo;ll see.  A month would be a long time to go without my iPod.</p>

			 <p>Last night was a date night for Becky and me. We dropped the girls off with some friends for a couple of hours and headed to Casa Las Glorias for the Mexican food I&rsquo;d been craving all week. Darn tasty stuff. (What&rsquo;s this white stuff on my nachos? (Sorry, square peg joke. Carry on.)) Unexpectedly, they had a musician strolling the aisles at the restaurant, singing and playing the guitar. He was singing what I&rsquo;d consider to be typical Mexican restaurant music, and doing a good job of it.</p>
<p>He finished another song in Spanish, thanked the patron at the table next to ours for a tip, and then started on another guitar strum. This one sounded vaguely familiar. I was trying to place it, and then he started singing, and I was dumbfounded. &ldquo;Well it looks like five thousand miles broke the camel&rsquo;s back&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not as though I had a plan to win you back&hellip;&rdquo; At this point Becky looked at me quizzically, because she recognized the song, too. No way. NO. WAY. The strolling guitarist in Casa Las Glorias is playing a Caedmon&rsquo;s Call song?!? What the heck!</p>
<p>The young man continued strolling and singing while we finished our dinner. He had an assortment of Mexican songs, but he was also verging into pop music territory with some John Mayer, Dave Matthews, and the like. When we finished dinner I gave him a tip and we discussed Caedmon&rsquo;s for a couple minutes. He was surprised to find another fan in the restaurant. He admitted that the latest album he owns is <em>Back Home</em>, and I encouraged him to get ahold of <em>Share The Well</em> and that they have a new album coming out in August. Then we parted ways; he kept singing, we headed off to continue our evening out.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it&rsquo;ll be many days before I hear a Caedmon&rsquo;s Call song sung in a restaurant again.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had two songs running pretty much on repeat today. This happens to me on frequent occasion; I get stuck on some song and I will just loop it over and over. It usually takes a day or two for the compulsion to go away.</p>
<p>The first one is <em>Nothing Left To Lose</em> by <a href="http://matkearney.com/">Mat Kearney</a>. Why this song? It gives me a feeling of calm; laid-back, content, happy. Not so much that it makes me calm, content and happy, but that it reminds me that it&rsquo;s possible. I&rsquo;ll admit right here that it doesn&rsquo;t have a lot to do with the lyrics - I probably couldn&rsquo;t sing along with the song if I wanted to - it&rsquo;s more to do with the music, the melody. Good stuff. Why is it stuck in my head? I think it started back on Sunday while we were eating breakfast at McDonalds while waiting for the rain to stop. This song came on over the McD&rsquo;s muzak system, and my brother Andrew and I both pretty much simultaneously started singing along. It was pretty cool</p>
<p>The other song is Coldplay&rsquo;s <em>Swallowed In the Sea</em>. Again, I haven&rsquo;t taken a lot of time to try to figure out the lyrics. What I love in this song is the way they build it sonically. It starts out pretty sparse, just some keyboards and a little bit of pad. Then they build it in, first with the drums, and finally with the guitars and vocal harmony, until at the end they&rsquo;ve built up this massive sound&hellip; it&rsquo;s so&hellip; <em>there</em>.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that suffers from this compulsion? What songs have been stuck in your head lately?</p>

			 <p>Yes, <a href="/07/05/camping/">as promised</a>, we went camping last weekend up at <a href="http://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/">Devil&rsquo;s Lake State Park</a> in Wisconsin. My brother Andrew pretty much organized the whole thing; his girlfriend Heather is visiting and it was good to get to see everybody. Some thoughts from the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Devil&rsquo;s Lake is a beautiful park. Dave, if you read this, yeah, it&rsquo;s worth going for a day trip or an overnight. Lots of nice hiking, the water is beautiful and crystal-clear.</li>
<li>What the park service considers &ldquo;paved, flat, and level&rdquo; in a hiking trail isn&rsquo;t so much what I&rsquo;d consider &ldquo;paved, flat, and level&rdquo;. It scares me a little bit what one of their &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; trails would look like. :-)</li>
<li>Tent camping when it gets down to 40F at night is kinda chilly.</li>
<li>Tent camping when it rains overnight is more of a pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, mind you, I don&rsquo;t want to sound whiny. It was a fun weekend, a good time was had by all. Many <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157600212050922/">pictures are available</a> on my Flickr site, and I&rsquo;ll append a few of them here. We had a fun time just crashing around the campfire, playing on the beach, and hiking. We enjoyed watching the rain whilst sitting indoors at McDonald&rsquo;s eating breakfast on Sunday. :-)</p>
<p>Overall, it was a good weekend, but good to be back home, too.</p>

			 <p>When I was a kid, we went camping as a family all the time. I think some of my siblings enjoyed the out-of-doors more than I did, but still, it was a good time for the whole family and a cost-effective way to go on vacation. :-) After we got married, Becky and I went camping a few times; most notably we were in Colorado camping when 9/11 happened&hellip; but that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today. Well, to tomorrow. Tomorrow morning we will pack the van and head out to Devil&rsquo;s Lake State Park in Wisconsin for two nights of camping with my family. Andrew&rsquo;s girlfriend Heather (hi, Heather, do you still read this thing?) is visiting for the next 10 days, so Andrew has organized pretty much the whole camping trip. (&ldquo;Remember to bring your softball equipment&rdquo; x 100 or so. :-) ) I&rsquo;m hoping the girls will enjoy it; they&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy seeing all the uncles and grandparents again. How well they sleep in a tent will be an entirely different story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to take a bunch of pictures and post them here once we get back. This weekend starts what will be a whirlwind month and a half for us; this camping trip, I have a trip to DC, Becky&rsquo;s folks visit for 2 weeks, I run a couple of 5ks, and then we go to Orlando for the better part of a week while the girls stay with their grandparents. It&rsquo;ll be fun, but it&rsquo;ll also be a relief to have it slow down in July.</p>
<p>(Yikes! Did I really just say July?)</p>

			 <p>When I decided to do 24 hours of Flickr, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what my Saturday would entail. Nonetheless, I gave it a go. As Saturdays go, it was fairly basic. We went to some neighborhood garage sales, cleaned out the garage, went shopping, and watched a movie. So while some of the pictures are cute, none of them are particularly artsy or profound. Oh well.</p>
<p>Here are a few samples of the pictures; you&rsquo;re welcome to visit <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/sets/72157600181071573/">the whole set on Flickr</a>.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Google Reader for some time now as my feed reader, and one of the more frustrating things has been its really bad email feature. When you find a blog post that you want to share with a friend, the email feature should make it easy, right? Unfortunately, Google Reader ended up dumping a bunch (but not all) of the text from the post in a horribly-formatted email. If I were Google I would&rsquo;ve been embarrassed that it was even an option. It was that bad.</p>
<p>Today, though, I find that they&rsquo;ve updated the email feature. Now when you click it, it just opens a little panel right in the blog post, lets you type in an email address (which it will auto-fill from your gmail address book if possible), and add a personal message. The email that it sends out then looks good; it includes all the original formatting, pictures, and a link back to Google Reader. Very nice.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to consider moving to Google Reader if you need a feed reader.</p>

			 <p>Part of the goofiness with my job is that by the time we get these announcements, I&rsquo;ve been done with the software for months. Still, it&rsquo;s fun to know that they&rsquo;re flying these things now.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/bizav/858-full.html#195107">AvWeb</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FIRST CITATION ENCORE+ DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Cessna Aircraft announced Tuesday that it delivered the first Citation Encore+ to an undisclosed customer. The latest Citation V derivative is powered by two FADEC-equipped, 3,400-pound-thrust Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW535B engines that offer &ldquo;high durability and reliability,&rdquo; and &ldquo;surpasses the most stringent environmental standards for emissions, set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Besides the upgraded powerplants, the $8.273 million Encore+ has an increased gross weight that allows for a full-fuel payload of 1,170 pounds, 340 pounds more than the original Encore. According to Cessna, this weight increase also extends the airplane&rsquo;s range with higher passenger loads. In the flight deck, the Encore+ sports a Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 integrated avionics suite, which marks a significant change from its predecessor&rsquo;s Honeywell Primus 1000 avionics.</p>

			 <p>One of my <a href="/05/04/softball/">very first posts</a> on my blog was about softball; hard to believe that&rsquo;s been two years ago. But yesterday night we started up the church softball season for another year. It was a beautiful night; the day was hot (at least, hot for April in Iowa) - it got close to 90 degrees in the afternoon. But by evening the breeze was blowing and the temps had cooled; what a great night for softball!</p>
<p>The first game of the year is always a bit of an adventure, seeing who will show up and how the team will fill out. To be sure, we have some regulars in their places; Nate at shortstop, Becky pitching, me at third, Shaun in left. But there&rsquo;s always a new guy or two you pick up who really help you out. This year it looks like we&rsquo;ve got two of them: Joel out in center field, and Nick at first. (It does this infielder&rsquo;s heart good to have a tall, left-handed first-baseman to throw to.)</p>
<p>Last night we played against one of the teams from New Covenant. It was the typical back-and-forth game; we were behind by a few runs, but then made a comeback as time was running out; I had a two-out, two-run single to tie up the game. It wasn&rsquo;t all heroics for me, though - I failed to tag up and advance on a base running play the inning before that would&rsquo;ve given us another run. :-( Oh well, one game at a time.</p>
<p>After playing the 6:00 game, I umped the 7:00 game. I actually really enjoy umping softball games, and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve improved on quite a bit over the past few years. It drives me nuts, though, that even in our C-league church league softball there are guys who will yell at the ump during the game for calls they don&rsquo;t like. Come on, guys. It&rsquo;s just a game. It&rsquo;s not worth it. (I know, I know - I better get used to it if I want to keep umping games. :-))</p>
<p>The church softball season runs through July and into early August. It definitely gives me something to look forward to on Monday nights.</p>

The latter, happily, starts and ends at Gutheridge Park, only 4 blocks or so from my house. While I don&rsquo;t expect to be competitive in either of the races, they provide some good motivation for me to keep training. I&rsquo;ve been getting lazy these last few weeks.

			 <p>A <a href="/07/03/a-resolution/">month ago today I resolved</a> I was going to put down my endless string of library books and spend a month just reading the Bible. Today is the end of that month.</p>
<p>April 20 I started reading in Genesis 1 and decided I&rsquo;d just read through, getting a feel for the breadth of the story. A month later I&rsquo;m through the book of Ezra, maybe a third of the way through the whole Book if you just look at how many pages I&rsquo;ve covered. It&rsquo;s been good reading and good reminder.</p>
<p>There have been some times I&rsquo;ve really missed having some other good book to read - most notably the hours I was on an airplane traveling to Salt Lake City and back, and occasionally in the evenings when something less-than-memorable is on TV and I&rsquo;m in the habit of reading while the TV&rsquo;s on.</p>
<p>I think it was a worthwhile exercise, though. It made me more convinced that I need to focus on reading quality books, things that will be worth my time, and avoid just rushing through a long string of mediocre titles just to max out my reading list. (I know there&rsquo;s no way my list will be as long as Kari&rsquo;s - no sense in going crazy trying.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be done with work a little big early today. I&rsquo;m going to suggest to Becky that we make an &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; stop at the library. :-)</p>

			 <p>This morning I had the privilege to preach at the Noelridge Sunday morning services. My text was Exodus 18, entitled &ldquo;A Father-In-Law&rsquo;s Lesson&rdquo; - based on the lesson that Jethro had for Moses. I think it went pretty well, I was excited to have the chance to preach again. For those of you interested, you can <a href="http://noelridge.org/dl.aspx?file=20070415.mp3">download the sermon (mp3, 7.1 MB)</a> or <a href="http://www.noelridge.org/downloads/20070415.m3u">stream it here</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: It sounds like I screwed up the audio; instead of converting it to mono, I managed to just delete one of the tracks. I also need to amplify the whole thing a bit. Maybe tonight. Still, if you can stand just listening to it in one ear, go for it.</p>
<p>I uploaded the new audio just now - converted it to full mono and amplified it so that it is about the right volume. Gotta love Audacity.</p>

			 <p>Life has been crazy this week, keeping me from writing much in the way of a thoughtful post about anything. I will inadequately attempt to make up for this by providing some random bullets from my week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orlando, here we come. My employer has decided to send me to a &ldquo;technology forum&rdquo; put on by a microprocessor company. It appears to me that &ldquo;technology forum&rdquo; is code words for &ldquo;wine and dine the engineers so they&rsquo;ll buy our product.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the last week in June, and we&rsquo;re planning that Becky will come along on the trip. She&rsquo;s just slightly excited.</li>
<li>Sermon preparation. I will be in the pulpit Sunday at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>. (I&rsquo;ll try to remember to post audio next week for the 0.03% of you that are interested.) Secret sneak preview for my few NPC readers: Jethro. You can figure it out from there. Actually, you probably can&rsquo;t. So you have to come and listen on Sunday. Ha!</li>
<li>Jabber servers, MySQL, PHP. Set up a <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber</a> server on a machine here at work for a project this week. Used <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp">Wildfire</a>, it went super-easy. Then learned enough PHP to generate web pages that display a given days' chat logs by pulling them out of the database. Good times.</li>
<li>Arcade Fire. Been listening to their latest album <em>Neon Bible</em> this morning and I like it.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Get the picture.&rdquo; With some unexpected funds coming in I am hoping to buy a digital SLR camera. I have my eye on a <a href="http://www.beachcamera.com/shop/product.aspx?sku=NKD70S1870">Nikon D70s</a>, hoping to be able to order it next week.</li>

			 <p>Got home last night from a quick business trip to Salt Lake City. I haven&rsquo;t been to SLC since a family trip many years ago. It&rsquo;s a beautiful place, and the weather was fresh and warming to spring. My co-worker and I spent 2 days in meetings before flying home. All in all, a good, worthwhile trip, uneventful flights, not bad at all. It was sure good to be home and see Becky and the girls again.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning we&rsquo;ll be heading out for Wisconsin to see my folks over Easter weekend. It will be good to see them again - it&rsquo;s only been a few weeks, I guess, but still&hellip; the girls change so much in just a few weeks, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be amazed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic update from the home front. I&rsquo;m debating pre-buying (and then downloading) the new Derek Webb album (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000OHZJJG/">on Amazon</a> or check it out at <a href="http://www.theringingbell.com">www.theringingbell.com</a>) so I can take it along on our drive tomorrow. I&rsquo;m listening to it streaming right now and it sounds really good. I&rsquo;m also shopping around for a Digital SLR camera. At the moment I have my eye on a <a href="http://www.beachcamera.com/shop/product.aspx?sku=NKD70S1870">Nikon D70s</a>.

			 <p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve been in it for a few days already, but I know there&rsquo;s still more to come this week.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon I drove four hours to Omaha to see Andy Osenga in concert at a little place called <a href="http://www.omahafoundry.com">The Foundry</a>. It was a great show, fun to see Andy again and visit. There was a 7:00 Saturday morning elder meeting scheduled at church, so I had to turn around and head back home right after the show. What I <em>did</em> learn from that experience was that the right combination of diet pop, sweet tea, Red Bull, and candy will keep me wide awake on a four-hour drive in the middle of the night. Good to know.</p>
<p>Saturday was the aforementioned meeting and then time at home to catch up a bit - cleaning, spending time with the family, watching some of the Final Four on TV. Also watched a pretty cool SciFi channel miniseries that I&rsquo;d TiVo&rsquo;d back in December called <em>The Lost Room</em>. Becky even enjoyed it. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Sunday morning I led music for both services, then we had an afternoon elder meeting, then the church&rsquo;s annual meeting in the evening. Thank the Lord most of that stuff is done with for now.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday morning, and I&rsquo;ll be at work for a few hours before heading home, eating lunch with the family, and then flying out to Salt Lake City for a quick trip for work. I&rsquo;ll be back home on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Friday morning I get off work (Good Friday) and so we are taking the girls up to my folks' place for the weekend. The girls will have fun seeing Grandma and Grandpa again. By the time I get back home on Sunday night, well, I&rsquo;ll be ready to be home for a while. :-)</p>
<p>Welcome to the Whirlwind. It&rsquo;s a wild ride.</p>

			 <p>This place has been full of links lately and very short on actual posts. Partly that&rsquo;s been due to some network difficulties, partly that&rsquo;s just been due to my own laziness. So finally I&rsquo;ve got my blog reconfigured so I can get to it all the time, and now it&rsquo;s time to write something.</p>
<p>Becky was remarking last night on how funny we are with our scheduling. If we have our whole week scheduled full with stuff, we go crazy. It&rsquo;s just too much. We have to have a couple of nights on the calendar kept open just for us as a family. That being said, when we have nights free on the calendar, we are unlikely to just stay home; more often we&rsquo;re out doing something as a family. (Maybe this&rsquo;ll change a little more now that spring is here and there is more outside work to be done?)</p>
<p>Take last night, for instance. We had the night free, so what did we do? Head to Coralville to the mall. Becky needed some summer clothes, so we spent a few hours, found a bunch of stuff for her, ate some supper there, and got home way past the girls' bedtime. But it was a good night. Now morning has just come a little early. :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of travel coming up in the next week. Friday afternoon I&rsquo;m driving to Omaha to see <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> play <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/154243/">a concert</a>. I&rsquo;m planning to just drive back after the show, so it&rsquo;ll be a lot of hours on the road, but still definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Then Monday I&rsquo;m headed out on a trip for work to Salt Lake City, and will be there until Wednesday night. Then with Friday off (Good Friday), we&rsquo;re heading up to Wisconsin to visit my folks for Easter weekend. So yeah, it&rsquo;ll be nice to finally be back home after all that. So far April isn&rsquo;t booked up too much&hellip; dunno how long that&rsquo;ll last. :-)</p>
<p>Having thus caught up on the trivial business of my life, I&rsquo;ll sign off.</p>

			 <p>As I updated my 2007 reading list yesterday, I became convicted about how many novels of dubious quality I&rsquo;ve read (23 books in 75 days!) and how short my time in the Scripture has been lately. As such, I am making this resolution: for the next month (March 20 - April 20), I am going to restrict my reading to just the Bible. I want to read it in broad pieces, to try to pick up the sweep of the grand story of God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far I&rsquo;ll get in just a month, but I have a feeling it&rsquo;ll be a ways. So don&rsquo;t expect any reading page updates for a while. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;ll be a great loss. :-)</p>

			 <p>In the midst of a church meeting last night discussing our church&rsquo;s future plans, a question came up that I imagine we will be wrestling with in future weeks.  I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what I think the answer is yet, so I&rsquo;ll post it here to see if any of you have comments.</p>
<p>The question goes something like this: in the context of a church, which comes first?  Do people first have to get &ldquo;the vision&rdquo;, and then will respond with committment?  Or rather, do people first need to be committed to serve, and then begin to see the vision of the church ministry?</p>
<p>Still chewing on this one&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Just thought I&rsquo;d follow up on <a href="/07/03/in-praise-of-good-customer-service/">my post from last week</a> about my experience with <a href="http://paradisepen.com">Paradise Pens</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, five days (and only three business days) after making that phone call, I received, via UPS, a replacement fountain pen. It had obviously been opened and tested out to ensure that it was in good shape before sending it to me. Then I noticed the mailing label. While I had bought my original pen in Arlington, VA, they shipped the replacement from their store in Minneapolis at the Mall of America, presumably since it was the closest store to me in Iowa. It impressed me that they would make that extra effort.</p>
<p>Two days later in a separate package I received another envelope with a pre-paid UPS shipping label and a nice handwritten note from the manager of the Arlington store. All I had to do was drop the old pen in the box, apply the label, and drop it off at a local UPS store.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using my pen all week and have really been enjoying it. I&rsquo;m thinking if I ever get another one, I&rsquo;ll be wanting a fine nib instead of the medium one that this pen has; I like to write in a fairly small script and it&rsquo;s hard to do with the wider nib. But overall, I am very, very impressed with the customer service I received. I will definitely be visiting Paradise Pens again when I go back to DC in May.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2007/03/16/billboards-from-god.html">Billboards from God</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2007/03/16/billboards-from-god.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2007-03-16 08:03:48 -0500">Mar 16, 2007</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On my way home from work every day I pass a billboard that frustrates me. It&rsquo;s a simple message, white text on a black background. It&rsquo;s designed to look like a written note. The words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One nation under Me.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
--God</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly this billboard was purchased by some well-meaning evangelical wanting to make a point about their beliefs that American was a Christian country, should continue to be a Christian country, etc, and remind us about the battle over the Pledge of Allegiance. I don&rsquo;t want to debate those points at all. Not that I necessarily agree with them exactly, but there are people in my congregation that would wholeheartedly agree with them, and I don&rsquo;t have time to write a full, thoughtful response to the ideas; nor do I want to offend them by giving a less than thoughtful answer. So let&rsquo;s leave that particular question alone.</p>
<p>These signs with &lsquo;messages from God&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t something new - they&rsquo;ve been a staple on billboards for the past several years, and on church signs for many years before that. Even the Life Magazine that came in today&rsquo;s newspaper had a collection of photos of church signs, including the ever-popular &ldquo;let&rsquo;s meet at my house today before the game &ndash; God&rdquo; sign. (As an interesting aside, one church is now using a reverse strategy: <a href="http://www.churchmarketingsucks.com/archives/2007/03/satan_hates_life.html">messages from Satan</a>.) In general, my attitude is iffy-but-OK with this type of message. Many times they just come across as cheesy (such as the church sign example above), but sometimes they can manage to be thought-provoking instead.</p>
<p>But this particular billboard really bothers me. Why? Because, first of all, it&rsquo;s not something God ever said. The &ldquo;One nation, under God&rdquo; phrase was added to our Pledge of Allegiance by Congress, back in the fifties. I guess it&rsquo;s become all too common today to put our words in God&rsquo;s mouth, but this seems pretty flagrant. Second, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a message that God would endorse. I don&rsquo;t think God is worried too much about America becoming a &ldquo;Christian nation&rdquo; again. God is much more concerned with people, individuals, coming to Him and being a part of His kingdom. God&rsquo;s focus is the Church, not the political system or national structure.</p>
<p>My call is that we set our priorities by His priorities. Sure, that&rsquo;s easy to say, harder to work out. But there are some places where it can be pretty clear. Let&rsquo;s put our focus on forwarding Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, not in trying to restore a &ldquo;Christian nation&rdquo;. If God wills, our country will come around. If not, well, God knows what He&rsquo;s doing. My guess it you&rsquo;re not going to find out about it, though, from a billboard.</p>

			 <p>This weekend we had very nearly my whole family over to visit.   My sister is still in Panama, but otherwise, my parents and all my brothers came in on Friday and got to stay through Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>We had massive amounts of food and celebration; fortunately then we were able to send some of the leftovers home with them, otherwise we&rsquo;d be eating them for a week and there&rsquo;d still be some to go bad.   There is still a bit of birthday cake hanging around, though&hellip;  I&rsquo;m looking forward to another piece of that carrot cake - yum yum.</p>
<p>Things are staying busy with the family these days - Mom and Dad are busy as usual; Ryan is waiting to hear on his acceptance to Georgetown grad school, Andrew got accepted to George Fox University and will be headed there in the fall&hellip;  and not leaving Aaron out: last week he bought a b-e-a-utiful Taylor acoustic guitar.  We had to keep a towel around just to wipe up all the drool.  :-)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve complained enough about bad customer service here on the blog (see: the OfficeMax debacle of a couple years ago) that I want to make sure I say something about really good service when it happens.</p>
<p>When I was in DC last week, I hit a shopping mall one night to wander around and pick up something for the girls. While I was in there, I ran across <a href="http://www.paradisepen.com">Paradise Pens</a>, a neat little store specializing in, well, pens. They had everything from basic ballpoint to pens costing nearly $2000. I wandered in and struck up a conversation with a very friendly store manager. I mentioned an interest in fountain pens (I&rsquo;ve often been curious, but never been to a store that sold them), and she took 20 minutes and showed me some different pens, let me try them out, answered my questions. Excellent service. I ended up buying a low-end fountain pen, cost about $40.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel and opened the pen, I found one issue: the pen cap, which is supposed to screw onto the pen body, was just a bit oversized. The cap wouldn&rsquo;t screw on, it just slipped off. Well, that isn&rsquo;t so good. I used a little bit of tape I had along to shim out the screw so it would hold, but that wasn&rsquo;t a good long-term solution. And I didn&rsquo;t have time to get back to the mall to return it.</p>
<p>Finally earlier this week I sent an email to the info address on the Paradise Pen website. After a couple of days I had no response, so I forwarded the email again. Who knows, maybe they are bad at checking email. Finally this afternoon I just decided to call the toll-free number they offered. So far, the service hadn&rsquo;t been so good, huh?</p>
<p>I called the number, dialed the extension, and the phone was answered by a real person. She said her name was Carrie. I said &ldquo;hi, my name is Chris Hubbs, and I&hellip;&rdquo; and she started to tell me my story, that I live in Iowa and bought a pen in DC and the cap was too big. I was stunned. &ldquo;So you got my email, I guess.&rdquo; Yes, she said, she&rsquo;d gotten both of them, and was surprised that the store hadn&rsquo;t gotten back to me yet. I went and checked my email, and found that a message had just arrived from the store. The manager of the DC store was letting me know that they were sending me a new pen and a postage-paid envelope to return the faulty one.</p>
<p>I told Carrie that I had received the email, and that the solution was fine with me. She gave me her name, phone number, and extension, and told me in no uncertain terms that if anything wasn&rsquo;t to my satisfaction, to call her directly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one with the big stick,&rdquo; she said. Wow, do I appreciate that attitude. I am looking forward to receiving my new pen and getting a chance to really use it. And I will now recommend Paradise Pens to anyone interested in buying a good pen.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last week I traveled for business to Washington, DC. While my original plans left me little time for sight-seeing, I still managed to take a long evening walk and see the memorials along the National Mall. Then old man winter intervened and pushed my flights around, giving me an unexpected whole day to visit museums. Now, I could give you a step-by-step itinerary of my trip, but it would likely bore you to death. (Now I&rsquo;ve set myself up to have to write something non-boring. Uh oh.) What I&rsquo;d rather talk about, though, is the overall experience I had.</p>
<p>This was my first visit to Washington. Ever since I was a kid I&rsquo;ve been a history and government junkie, so I was excited to get to see some of the places for real that I&rsquo;d only seen in pictures. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. It&rsquo;s even more impressive to be there and see them. First, because many of the buildings are massive in a way that a photograph just can&rsquo;t communicate. (The Supreme Court? Unbelievably immense.) But second, because all the buildings are so close together. You come up from the Metro, and bam! there&rsquo;s the Library of Congress. Walk past it and bam! there&rsquo;s the Supreme Court. Then turn the corner and whammo! the Capitol building. And on and on. Amazing.</p>
<p>As I started my journey down the Mall, I felt a little bit sheepish playing tourist; I seemed to be the only tourist around, everyone else was just finishing up work for the day. Still, I had fun snapping pictures and marveling at the architecture. Halfway down the Mall you reach the Washington Monument. Some 500+ feet tall, it&rsquo;s a massive obelisk that dominates the skyline. I took a few pictures to try to capture the sunset off in the west and the ring of flags that surrounds the monument. I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t really capture it, though - it&rsquo;s just too much to take in with a camera lens. (At least, too much for me and my camera lens.) At the Washington Monument I finally saw a few other tourists, all doing the same as me, gazing up at this massive two-tone tower.</p>
<p>I continued my trek westerly across the Mall. From the Washington Monument you have a long walk past the reflecting pool until you reach the Lincoln Memorial. Coming from the east like I did, it isn&rsquo;t immediately apparent what exactly the reflecting pool reflects. The pool is long, fairly wide, a few feet deep, and made semi-famous as the pool that Forrest Gump wades into at the end of the movie. (I heard two separate tourists that I passed on the walk mention this fact, so it must have been more memorable to them than it was to me.) It was also drained for the winter; there was just a little bit of water in the center of the pool where the snowmelt had run. It was anything but impressive as I walked by it in the winter dusk, but it made a comfortable walking path as I headed toward Lincoln.</p>
<p>The guidebooks all describe the Lincoln Memorial as the most popular of the memorials on the Mall. This was evidenced to me as I walked toward it that night - the frequent camera flashes reflecting off the inner walls of the memorial lit it up beyond the already-bright normal lighting. When I reached the Memorial, there was no shortage of tourists, even though it was nearly seven pm. Adults, small children, families, a school group, all in awe of the massive man of marble. And then I turned around.</p>
<p>As magnificent as the Lincoln Memorial is, what really captured me (and many of the others) was the view back across the Mall. So <em>that&rsquo;s</em> why they have a reflecting pool: from the Lincoln Memorial you can see the whole Washington Monument reflected. Even in the snowmelt a patchy reflection lit the Mall. Far in the distance the Capitol was lit up brightly. What an amazing scene.</p>
<p>Now why do I keep bringing up the number of tourists there? Wouldn&rsquo;t I have preferred there were fewer so there would be less crowding? Well, crowding wasn&rsquo;t really an issue. But what got to me was this: even in these contentious political days, a diverse group of visitors could all stop for a few minutes and share the wonder. We could all appreciate the beauty and truth of Lincoln&rsquo;s words engraved in the wall of the memorial. We could all feel thankful for past leaders like George Washington. We could all stop and feel the love of a free country, this country, <em>our</em> country. Amazing.</p>
<p>Rich Mullins summed up my feelings toward my country so well in his song <em>Land of my Sojurn</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody tells you when you get born here How much you&rsquo;ll come to love it And how you&rsquo;ll never belong here So I&rsquo;ll call you my country But I&rsquo;ll be longing for my home And I wish that I could take you there with me&hellip;</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a disorienting past ten days  or so; last weekend (10 days ago) we had the big storm, which meant church was canceled, which always really throws me off.  Then last week I was on travel, only in the office for a few hours on Friday.  So by Saturday night I had no real idea what day it was&hellip;  fortunately Becky reminded me that we would be going to church the next morning.</p>
<p>We had a bit of a backwards morning at church music-wise.  David Green, normally our bass player, was leading music from the piano.  He asked me to play bass with him.  So I hacked my way through it, and I think we managed OK.  A learning experience for both of us.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday morning and I can look forward to a regular week at the office.   There are times I&rsquo;m less than excited about coming in to work, but this week it&rsquo;ll just be nice to have things back to normal.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;home again, home again, jiggety jig.</p>
<p>I always seem to forget the beginning of that rhyme, but I quote the end of it often enough.  I made it home last night from Washington (via Minneapolis) thanks to the skill of the Northwest Airlines pilots who drove our DC-9 through snow and 30 knot landing winds to get us to Cedar Rapids.  Still, it was a late night - got home about 12:30, and many thanks go out to Daniel Garner for graciously agreeing to pick me up at the airport so Becky could stay home with the girls.</p>
<p>When I get a chance to stop and think, I&rsquo;m sure there are a couple more blog posts to be written about this trip, but for now I&rsquo;m just glad to be home.</p>

			 <p>This week is time for my first business trip in a while, and yesterday found me heading out of Cedar Rapids for Washington, DC.  While here I&rsquo;ll be participating on an industry committee that will be <a href="http://rtca.org/comm/Committee.cfm?id=68">developing guidance</a> for Synthetic Vision and Enhanced Vision Systems for aircraft.   While I&rsquo;m not in meetings, I&rsquo;m hoping to do some sightseeing, since this is my first visit to Washington.  Most of the museums and stuff are closed after 5 pm, but at least I&rsquo;ll be able to walk the Mall and see the memorials and such.</p>
<p>My flight made it in to Reagan National airport on time and I rode the Metro up to my hotel.  As I was nearing the hotel, I was thinking it looked a little dark&hellip;  when I reached the hotel lobby, I found out that the power was out for this and a few nearby blocks, and would be out until midnight.  Sigh.  They checked me in with pencil and paper, and sent me with a couple of glowsticks to my room.   I dropped off my stuff and then went down and asked for directions to a restaurant that would still have power.  I ended up at <a href="http://eatyourpizza.com/">Pizzeria Paradiso</a>, where I had a very tasty &ldquo;Atomica&rdquo; pizza and read a book for a while.  Then I walked back to the hotel, sat in my room in the dark, and had just enough laptop battery left to watch a couple of hours of Battlestar Galactica.  As BSG was wrapping up, the lights came back on, so I was able to really check out the room (very nice!), iron some clothes, and head for bed.</p>
<p>The combination of a late night and an unfamiliar bed made this morning come a little bit too soon, but the complimentary breakfast was tasty.  In a few minutes I&rsquo;ll be headed out to walk the five blocks over to <a href="http://rtca.org">RTCA</a> for the meeting.  It&rsquo;s supposed to be up to 50 here today, so it should be nice for walking after we&rsquo;re done today.  I&rsquo;ll take lots of pictures, but won&rsquo;t have any way to upload them until I get home&hellip;  so keep coming back here and eventually you&rsquo;ll see some!</p>

			 <p>Last night I used a jigsaw to cut two small notches, pulled the garage door opener up about another inch, reconnected everything, and it worked! So, 9 days, some very cold fingers, and <a href="/07/02/i-fought-the-door-and-the-door-won/">one broken thumb</a> later, we have a functional garage door and can park the vehicles in the garage again.</p>
<p>This opener has three working remotes, which means one for each car and one for the house&hellip; no more cold, late-night, barefoot trips outside when we forget to shut the garage door! The only thing still not working is our van, which is supposedly equipped with the HomeStar system, and thus should be able to be programmed to open the garage door from a button on the overhead panel. So far, no luck. But even if I don&rsquo;t get that figured out, I can live with it. :-) It feels good to finally get that project finished.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday morning  we got a guy out to fix the garage door, so it now goes up and down like it should.  So last night I spent most of the evening trying to get the garage door opener installed.  Close, but no banana.  The rail on this opener is a bit taller than the previous one, and with the limited space between the garage door and the rafters in the garage, it&rsquo;s just too tight.  So my next step will have to be to use a jigsaw and cut a small (1/2&quot; max) notch in the right spot in a couple of rafters.  Slowly but slowly, it&rsquo;s coming together.</p>

			 <p>Today was lining up to be a fairly unadventurous Saturday. I had a church basketball game in the morning - we got beat by a team who must&rsquo;ve shot 85% from the field for the game. They were on. It was scary. Then we took the family to Hy-Vee for a late breakfast, and a few of our friends joined us. Finally, we headed home. My remaining task for the day was to install a new garage door opener. Our old one is probably 30 years old and has been slowly dying for a while now. We found a nice new one on clearance at Lowe&rsquo;s last week and bought it. So, I was all set.</p>
<p>I got the new opener unpacked and assembled. Then I took down the old one. So far, so good. However, I noticed as I was taking down the old opener that the torsion spring for the garage door, normally attached by two lag bolts to the frame of the garage, had pulled out one bolt and was in the process of pulling out the other one. Here&rsquo;s an example of a torsion spring:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No problem, I thought. A quick trip to Lowe&rsquo;s procured two larger lag bolts, and I set about installing them. It was a bit tricky - I had to put some weight on the spring to hold it down into place, but I managed to get the first bolt in. Then I came back up to tighten it, and the whole thing let loose. I didn&rsquo;t see exactly what happened, but my left hand was bleeding and swelling. So Becky called Janice who was a life saver and came over to stay with the girls, who were napping. Then we went to the urgent care clinic.</p>
<p>One hour and three x-rays later, the doctor decided that I had fractured the last bone in my thumb (the one at the end of my thumb). No stitches were necessary, they just used some pressure bandages on my thumb and index finger to get the bleeding to stop. And I&rsquo;ll have to wear a splint on my thumb for 4-6 weeks until the bone heals. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like now:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>So, this will put a damper on a few activities. No more basketball for the rest of the season. I will probably be able to play the piano enough to lead worship at church next Sunday as planned, but I wouldn&rsquo;t hold out much hope for the Bach fugue on the pipe organ for the talent show. It has been a bit of a challenge typing this post, too, but I&rsquo;m starting to figure out how to type without my index finger and thumb on my left hand.</p>
<p>Mostly I&rsquo;m thankful that it wasn&rsquo;t any worse; it sure could&rsquo;ve been. The Lord was watching over me, even in my poor judgment of what I could manage. I&rsquo;ll be calling an overhead door company on Monday, and will gladly pay them to fix the torsion spring and finish the opener installation. Some things, I guess, are just better left to the professionals.</p>

			 <p>So last night I had the chance to do some practice on the pipe organ at Central Park Presbyterian Church in preparation for the talent show coming up a week from Sunday. I showed up at 6:45 and the kind man had already turned on the lights and turned up the heat so I could practice. I pulled out my copy of <em>Tocatta and Fugue in D-Minor</em> and got right to it.</p>
<p>Two hours later was reminded of a time soon after I started taking piano lessons when I swore I never wanted to play the piano again. The song in question was the Suzuki classic <em>Lightly Row</em>, and the challenge was to make the left hand play something different than the right hand was playing. Fortunately, I got through it, and my hands have been happily individually dexterous for years now. Enter the pipe organ, which includes two manuals of keys, plus two octaves of pedals.</p>
<p>For twenty-some years now, I have trained my brain that the left hand follows the notes on the bottom staff. But not on the organ! Early on in the Bach piece, there is a little pattern where the hands play some separated chords, just stepping down: B-flat, A-minor, G-minor, A. The pedal moves in parallel, playing D C B-flat, A. It must&rsquo;ve taken me 30 minutes of practice to try to play those two lines. My left hand just kept getting lost.  I think I pulled something, somewhere in my brain.</p>
<p>I found I can play the pedals pretty well by themselves; the intervals are pretty easy to figure out, and with a little practice I&rsquo;ll know where the notes are without having to look. I can play the pedals and the right hand together without too much effort. But the left hand just doesn&rsquo;t want to cooperate. I&rsquo;ll try to get over to the church again next week for some more practice and we&rsquo;ll see how much I can get worked out. Worst case, I&rsquo;ll creatively omit some of the harder pedal parts for the talent show&hellip; I&rsquo;ll feel bad about doing it, but it&rsquo;ll be better than not playing it at all.</p>
<p>One other thing took getting used to with that organ: the timing. Since it&rsquo;s a real pipe organ, driven by real air, there is a perceptible time lag between when you press the key and when you hear the note. When you&rsquo;re playing long held notes, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal. But when you&rsquo;re playing Bach with all the sixteenth-notes, you have to mentally force yourself to make your fingers do the right thing and ignore the timing. It took me a while to get that figured out, but I think it makes sense now.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve used that title before, but oh well. Seems like this place has been filled up with book reviews lately and not much else. Let&rsquo;s see, what else should I talk about? The cold? The temperature display on my PC at the moment says it&rsquo;s -9 degrees F outside. We&rsquo;re supposed to get a heat wave by the weekend, though - up into the 20&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Life has pretty much settled down for now after the craziness of December and early January. One bit of fun is that we&rsquo;re having our church talent show down at Central Park Presbyterian Church (a facility we&rsquo;re talking about buying), and they have a nice pipe organ&hellip; so I got a request for some organ music. I&rsquo;ve been working on Bach&rsquo;s famous <em>Tocatta &amp; Fugue in D Minor</em> for a couple of weeks now and have the keyboard parts learned pretty well&hellip; but I&rsquo;m worried that the pedal parts will be my undoing. I&rsquo;m headed over to the church tomorrow night to practice on the organ for a while. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes. If it&rsquo;s a total flop I&rsquo;ll just pull out some piano fugues and play &lsquo;em on the organ&hellip; good enough. But still&hellip; a PIPE ORGAN! Too much fun.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My dad loaned me <em>Hell&rsquo;s Best Kept Secret</em> by Ray Comfort back at Thanksgiving, and sadly it had set by my night table since then, still waiting to be read. Dad reminded me about it the other day, so I picked it up last night and read through it. It&rsquo;s a short little book, maybe 150 pages in paperback, but contains a lot of good stuff.</p>
<p>I was not really familiar with Ray Comfort before reading his book. A quick online search shows that he is the main man at <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/">Living Waters</a> ministry, and that he&rsquo;s done a series of TV programs called &ldquo;The Way of the Master&rdquo; with Kirk Cameron. His website says that Living Waters &ldquo;&hellip;has been equipping Christians across the world for more than 30 years. We train Christians who want to learn evangelism &ndash; by teaching them how to witness the way Jesus did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will admit that a brief browsing of the Living Waters website makes me a bit queasy; products they have for sale include the <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=536">Intelligent Design vs. Evolution Board Game</a> and <a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=298">novelty Million-Dollar bills that contain a Gospel presentation</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m to keen on either of those ideas, but then this is supposed to be about the book, right, not about Ray Comfort&rsquo;s ministry in general.</p>
<p>Mr. Comfort gets right to it in the first chapter. We find out that Hell&rsquo;s best-kept secret is the message that our sins condemn us to hell unless we trust Christ for salvation. He says that the reason 80 - 90% of &ldquo;conversions&rdquo; from altar calls and crusades fail is that people are coming because they are promised something good, that Christianity will make their life better. Then when tribulation comes, people fall away because all of a sudden Christianity isn&rsquo;t helping them out any more. He gives the illustration of two men on an airplane. If you offer the first one a parachute, telling him it will make his flight more pleasant, the guy will immediately take it off, because it&rsquo;s heavy and bulky and uncomfortable. If you offer the second one a parachute, telling him to wear it because at any minute he&rsquo;s gonna have to jump out of the airplane from 20,000 feet, he will thank you profusely and will keep the parachute on regardless of the discomfort, because he has a view of the danger that will come should he not have the parachute.</p>
<p>Comfort quotes profusely (and at times repetitively) from D. L. Moody and Charles Spurgeon, among others, to say that an understanding of our condemnation under the law is a key starting point to understanding the Gospel. In that message I can&rsquo;t disagree with Comfort - he&rsquo;s right on. The Good News of salvation through Christ isn&rsquo;t really good news unless there&rsquo;s something we need saved <em>from</em>. Where I wrestled with this book wasn&rsquo;t in the particulars of the message, but was more with my reaction of the entire method he was proposing. The book itself is about 20 years old. I see him writing it to react against what he&rsquo;d seen at big evangelistic crusades (Billy Graham, maybe?). Then several times in the book he talks about doing streetcorner preaching, or about stopping at a train station and just having the Lord direct him to people who he could sit and talk to. In all those cases, I see them being more prevalent and on-topic 20 years ago than they are today. Let me try to explain.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Tim Keller hit it right on back at the Desiring God 2006 conference when he noted that our world to day is post-Christian. He talked about a historical 20th century progression of evangelism techniques that started with the crusades of Billy Sunday, then later Billy Graham; later it transitioned to the personal evangelism methods found in Evangelism Explosion; then towards the very end of the 20th century and into the 21st we have &ldquo;seeker services&rdquo;. Keller postulates that we have three problems in reaching postmoderns: 1) a truth problem - they don&rsquo;t like our exclusive claim of truth. 2) Guilt problem - it assumes they have a consciousness of guilt. 3) A meaning problem - they don&rsquo;t believe texts can really get a meaning across.</p>
<p>Number 2 is the one that I think hits it - for many people these days, there is a lot to establish philosophically before we can get to the idea of an absolute standard and guilt before God. Now, I think most of them have an inner understanding of guilt but won&rsquo;t admit it; they have been convinced that there is no absolute truth, no God to whom they are accountable, and thus their feelings of guilt are a product of some bad thinking on their part. So when we start the discussion, we may not be able to start with &ldquo;do you understand that you&rsquo;re guilty before God?&rdquo;, we may have to start with &ldquo;what is truth?&rdquo; and go from there.</p>
<p><a href="/05/11/things-arent-right/">I wrote over a year ago</a> that the place that makes sense for me to start the story is with this phrase: &ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; There is a statement we can all pretty much agree on. Yes, some hardcore types may want to argue that there is no &ldquo;right&rdquo;, so how can things not be right&hellip; but as C. S. Lewis argues in <em>Mere Christianity</em>, you only have to do something bad to that person to get them to start appealing to a universal moral standard. :-) Then we can talk about why things are wrong, and how God has a plan to set them right again.</p>
<p>I have over the past few years started tending towards the Calvinist side of Gospel presentation. Not that I&rsquo;m going over into full five-point Calvinism; that&rsquo;s a topic for another post. But it seems to me that we are called to proclaim the Gospel to everyone. Even as believers, we need to be reminded of the Gospel, of the good news that God has provided a way for us to be redeemed and to become a part of His kingdom. Non-believers need to hear it, too; how far back in the story we have to start will largely depend on where they are philosophically. For those who still have a Judeo-Christian mindset, we can probably start with Mr. Comfort&rsquo;s approach and talk about our guilt before God. For those firmly entrenched in postmodernism, we&rsquo;ll probably have to back up a few steps. Either way, we have good news to share, and we need to share it.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Finally I complete another entry on my reader-suggested reading list: <em>Velvet Elvis</em> by Rob Bell. Thanks Heather for the recommendation!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a harder time writing a review for this book than I have for any of the previous ones I&rsquo;ve read. I&rsquo;m not too sure what my conclusion is yet. Some general observations are in order, though.</p>
<p>First, I&rsquo;m not too keen on the general writing style. The book is full of single sentences masquerading as paragraphs. Now, these aren&rsquo;t long, Pauline run-on sentences; these are short, one line sentences with lots of white space between them. As a consequence, to me the book sounds less like a well-reasoned argument for something and more like a collection of little thoughts that don&rsquo;t necessarily connect so well. Maybe I&rsquo;m just too old to get it.</p>
<p>Second, I haven&rsquo;t seen Rob Bell&rsquo;s NOOMA videos. I&rsquo;ve heard they&rsquo;re pretty good, and they might clue me in on a little more of what he&rsquo;s thinking. I haven&rsquo;t heard any other of Bell&rsquo;s stuff, either, so all I have to base my understanding of him on is this book.</p>
<p>There were a couple things that I disagreed with in there. First of all, towards the beginning of the book he goes through this extended illustration about how doctrines are like the springs on a trampoline - how they serve to propel us and our faith and our actions. Fine, I guess, OK. But then he goes on to argue that, hey, even if you&rsquo;re missing a spring, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the trampoline won&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;m starting to get a little queasy with the illustration at that point. Then he says, hey, so if the virgin birth doesn&rsquo;t happen to be true, that spring pops off the trampoline, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t work. And at that point he has gone too far. To my reading, Bell is not denying the virgin birth of Christ; however, he&rsquo;s clearly leaving the door open. This is a problem, a big problem. I think the virgin birth is one of the essentials of the faith that we simply must hold to. (Side note: Mark Driscoll addressed this pretty directly back in September at the Desiring God 2006 conference.) So Bell loses bigtime points with me on that issue.</p>
<p>Secondly, I have some queasiness with Bell&rsquo;s discussion about interpreting the Scripture. His basic argument is that Scripture <em>has</em> to be interpreted; that much I agree with. He ridicules people who will say &ldquo;let me tell you what the Bible says&rdquo;, saying that they&rsquo;re just trying to sell you their interpretation. I guess I&rsquo;m OK with all that. Where I start to get uneasy is when he encourages his readers to continue reinterpreting everything. He seemed to come dangerously close to saying that there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a &ldquo;right&rdquo; interpretation of any Scripture, that we should just use the interpretation that makes sense to us. I don&rsquo;t think he actually said that, but he seems to be oriented that direction. That bothers me a bit. As Christians we can&rsquo;t be so postmodern that we refuse to say there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way to view the truth&hellip; that just won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Other than that, I didn&rsquo;t have any huge problems with <em>Velvet Elvis</em>, but at the same time I didn&rsquo;t find it that compelling. Sorry, Heather, wish I could give it a better rating, but I just didn&rsquo;t come away from it very excited. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to try it again another time.</p>

			 <p>I stopped at the library yesterday afternoon to pick up a book I had reserved. (<em>Velvet Elvis</em> by Rob Bell, yes, Heather, I&rsquo;m finally getting around to reading it.) And of course, even with my book backlog, I couldn&rsquo;t stop with just that one book - I had to pick up two more while I was at it. My book pile next to my bed has gotten large. Very large. From memory, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s sitting there waiting to be read:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This is Your Brain on Music</em> - Daniel Levitin - a fascinating book about how our brains deal with and remember music. I&rsquo;m about 2/3 done with this one.</li>
<li><em>Submarines: A History</em> - I forget the author. I started this one before I bought the previous title. It&rsquo;s in progress as well.</li>
<li><em>Traitor</em> - Stephen Coonts - I enjoy Coonts, this appears to be his latest.</li>
<li><em>Velvet Elvis</em> - Rob Bell - Just picked it up. This will be the next one I start.</li>
<li><em>The Ragtime Club</em>? - some random novel I picked up yesterday, deals with Scott Joplin and the ragtime music scene. Looks mildly interesting.</li>
<li><em>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</em> - Doris Kearns Goodwin - my mom recommended this one. Should be interesting.</li>
<li><em>The Republic</em> - Plato - picked this one up with a Christmas gift card.</li>
<li><em>The Everlasting Man</em> - G. K. Chesterton - This one is in progress as well - good stuff, but slow going.</li>
<li><em>Beyond All Earthly Powers</em> - David Wells - a freebie for attending the Desiring God 2006 conference.</li>
<li><em>Lectures to my Students</em> - Spurgeon - Bought at the DG2006 conference, read the first few chapters, it&rsquo;s still sitting there.</li>
<li><em>Looking Unto Jesus</em> - Isaac Ambrose - my dad gave me this one a couple of years ago - I have started on it several times and never finished. Slow going, but good stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be a few others, that&rsquo;s just all I can think of for now.</p>
<p>[Checked tonight when I got home - found I&rsquo;d missed a couple: <em>What I Saw At The Revolution</em> by Peggy Noonan and <em>Case Closed</em> by Gerald Posner. I guess I&rsquo;ve got even *more* reading to do. :sigh:</p>

			 <p>I understand from reading the news that President Bush gave the State of the Union address back on Tuesday night. I skipped it. I actually even avoided it - when I turned the TV on, it was in progress. I flipped to ESPN. This is a departure for me. I have long held great interest in State of the Union (let&rsquo;s just call them SOTU for short) speeches. When I was in high school I used my boom box to record them off the radio onto a cassette so I could listen to them again later. In past years I have sat with rapt attention to the network of my choice and had a thrill of excitement as the Sergeant-at-Arms would walk in and declare, &ldquo;Mister Speaker, the President of the United States!&rdquo;. But not this year.</p>
<p>I have become disenchanted with politics these days. Not uninterested, mind you; nor would I say that they are unimportant. But I have become disappointed with all of my political leaders and the very system that they operate in. I am not excited about any of the political topics they are pushing. Gone are the days when I thought they might actually do something about Social Security reform. Gone are the hopes that some serious income tax reform might be in the works. Now we&rsquo;re supposed to get excited about a higher minimum wage and even more money for education and social programs.</p>
<p>I have long been a supporter of President Bush. The first ballot I ever cast, back as a high-school student in Texas, included a vote for him to be Governor of Texas. I have voted for him twice in presidential elections. He&rsquo;s made some decisions I&rsquo;ve been very happy with. (Nominating John Roberts to the Supreme Court is one of my favorites.) But on fiscal and governance issues, he has disappointed me greatly. Gone are Reagan&rsquo;s conservative ideals of less government, less spending, and lower taxes. Now we just have more programs. Gone are tightly-held ideals of less government regulation and free speech; we just sign McCain-Feingold and let the Supreme Court sort it out. And then there&rsquo;s the war.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written much about the war here. Initially I was in favor of it. I don&rsquo;t really want to debate that case here now; I thought the president presented a compelling case, and it was good for us to go get rid of Saddam. But the mess we are in now seems more and more troubling. The sad part is that I don&rsquo;t see a good exit strategy. I&rsquo;m not convinced that sending more troops will help subdue things and finish off the war. (I&rsquo;m not saying it won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m just not convinced that it will.) But cutting and running isn&rsquo;t a viable option, either. At this point, I&rsquo;m about out of ideas, other than to pray for wisdom for the leadership and safety for the troops.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s going to take to get me excited about political goings-on again. I&rsquo;d like to see a real conservative candidate from the Republican party for the 2008 election. If there were some real conservative principles championed, rather than just &ldquo;my programs will be better than their programs&rdquo;, maybe I&rsquo;d be more interested. At least the Republicans have a better record on moral issues, though who knows how long that&rsquo;ll last. The key difficulty here is that in our two-party system, my choice is either to vote for the Republican I&rsquo;m unexcited about, or the Democrat I am even less excited about. And don&rsquo;t start on me about third-party candidates - I know a wasted vote when I see one.</p>
<p>So this is probably as close as I&rsquo;ll come on this blog to a political rant. Feel free to respond and interact. Tell me why I&rsquo;m wrong (or right), and what suggestions you&rsquo;d have for me. I am increasingly thankful that God&rsquo;s priority is with individual hearts, not political influence.</p>

			 <p>Classical music has had a big influence in my life. My parents are both lovers of classical music. (Probably my dad more than my mom, but I&rsquo;m not too sure there.) It was pretty much all we had on at home growing up. Lots of ::wikipedia(&ldquo;Bach&rdquo;):: and ::wikipedia(&ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo;):: all the way through ::wikipedia(&ldquo;Rimsky_Korsakov&rdquo;,&ldquo;Rimsky-Korsakov&rdquo;):: and ::wikipedia(&ldquo;Igor_Stravinsky&rdquo;,&ldquo;Stravinsky&rdquo;)::. I started playing the piano at age 7 and thus entered a bunch more classical music. I played lots of Bach, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Chopin">Chopin</a>, Beethoven, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy">Debussy</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Grieg">Grieg</a>. I really enjoyed it. I was the nerdy kid who at age 12 listened to a NPR program where they compared two new recordings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff&rsquo;s</a> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Night_Vigil">Vespers</a></em>, and enjoyed it. But I digress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say which composer or era is my favorite. I love the Baroque for Bach (<em>Das Wohltemperierte Klavier</em>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Handel">Handel</a> (<em>The Messiah, Water Music</em>). I dig the classical and romantic periods: the beauty of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart">Mozart</a>, the intensity of Beethoven, the breadth of the piano works of Chopin. I about wore out a tape of Haydn Cello Concertos whilst growing up, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Brain">Dennis Brain&rsquo;s</a> legendary recording of Mozart Horn Concertos is never far from my iPod&rsquo;s playlist. But then you get to Rachmaninoff. Of all the composers, I adore Rachmaninoff. I fell in love with his second Piano Concerto in my teens, managed to learn enough to hack my way through the easier bits of it, then in college reacquainted myself with <em>Vespers</em> and more of his solo piano works. They&rsquo;re ridiculously difficult to play, but remain my favorites. And don&rsquo;t let me forget the French guys like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy">Debussy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulenc">Poulenc</a>.</p>
<p>I have to confess that my appreciation for &ldquo;classical music&rdquo; written in the later parts of the 20th century wanes quite a bit. I have yet to develop the love for Stravinsky that my father has. Neither am I real fond of Ives, Barber, or Bartok. Aaron Copland is on my &ldquo;love him&rdquo; list, though, as is Ralph Vaughan Williams. As for real modern stuff, I&rsquo;m not really current on it. I&rsquo;ve heard a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Hovhaness">Alan Hovhaness</a> that I liked. By the time you get the late 20th century, the orchestral stuff I really enjoy has mostly been written as film scores by guys like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams">John Williams</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barry_%28composer%29">John Barry</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner">James Horner</a>.</p>
<p>So, more than you wanted to know about my tastes in classical music, right? Feel free to leave comments below.</p>

			 <p>Sometime while we were gone on our Christmas vacation, our local Krispy Kreme closed down. It opened back in 2000, is only two blocks from our house, and the smell of fresh donuts often wafted over to tantalize us. I have a love-hate relationship with Krispy Kreme donuts; when they&rsquo;re fresh and warm, they&rsquo;re a real treat. Once they&rsquo;ve cooled to room temperature, they become a total sugar overload and I am no longer a real fan. But still, I&rsquo;m sad to see them go.</p>
<p>The local Krispy Kreme franchise owner says that the distributing facilities elsewhere in the state can handle the Cedar Rapids area&rsquo;s distribution needs, and Krispy Kreme donuts will still be available in many retail stores. So people can still get their fix if they really need it&hellip; but it won&rsquo;t be the same as driving up to the store in the morning, the smell of donuts in the air, and being offered a free fresh hot glazed donut. Wow, those were good.</p>
<p>On the upside, the news story says they&rsquo;re likely to open an Arby&rsquo;s in the old Krispy Kreme building. That will make Becky very happy. :-)</p>

			 <p>On to a book recommended by Nate Downey: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=038070613X%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/038070613X%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">Taliesin</a></em> by Stephen Lawhead, which is book one of five books in Lawhead&rsquo;s <em>Pendragon Cycle</em>.</p>
<p>I read <em>Taliesin</em> over Christmas break. My first surprise was when I looked at the publisher&rsquo;s page in the front of the book and saw it was published by CrossWay Books, which is a Christian publishing house. &ldquo;UhOh&rdquo;, I thought&hellip; &ldquo;I hope this isn&rsquo;t going to be some silly Christian novel trying to masquerade as fantasy.&rdquo; But I had faith in Nate&rsquo;s selection, so I read on. And I was not let down.</p>
<p><em>The Pendragon Cycle</em> deals with the Arthurian legend, trying to flesh out the story and put faces on the people. <em>Taliesin</em> is a great deal of back story; it follows the lives of a young lord in England and a princess of Atlantis who end up marrying; they have a child named Merlin who ends up being, well, <em>that</em> Merlin. Along the way there is a typical amount of fantasy-type plot: we see Atlantis' destruction, intrigue, rivalry, and warfare between the various clans, and the introduction of some early Christian missionaries.</p>
<p>It was that last bit that started to get me worried. The missionaries are introduced about two-thirds of the way through the book, and while on one hand I know that the Arthurian legend needs to have a Christian component (he does seek the Holy Grail, after all), I was worried that it might turn from a decent novel into an evangelistic enterprise quicker than you can say Pendragon. But the author handles it well; he allows the characters to become Christians and wrestle with Christian ideas while avoiding the trap of having them give long speeches about how everyone should come to Jesus and the like.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed <em>Taliesin</em> - thanks, Nate! I will now have to reserve book two from the library when I get a chance.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let me tell the tale of the Great New Year&rsquo;s Eve Flood of Aught-Six. You won&rsquo;t hear it from anyone else. As most calamities begin, so began this one; not with a single odd event, but with the convergence of multiple odd events. In this case there were two:</p>
<ol>
<li>A stoppage in a pipe somewhere kept the toilet from draining.</li>
<li>The flapper valve in the toilet stuck open, causing the water to run and run.</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result of the convergence of these two events was the Great New Year&rsquo;s Eve Flood of Aught-Six. At first, it didn&rsquo;t appear to be too bad; water had run out of the bathroom and into the hallway, but that was about it. Becky called for me to help, and I quickly used the shut-off valve to stop the water. We grabbed some towels and started sopping up the mess. Then we heard another sound of water running. Suffice it to say that our floors are not waterproof; the wooden floor let water run through right down into the basement. And then a bunch of water backed up near the toilet and made its way down as well.</p>
<p>So downstairs we went, to find water running from the drop ceiling in several places. I grabbed a bucket to catch the worst of it, but there was already a nice puddle stretching from the computer table over to Laura&rsquo;s playset. Again with the towels. My computer monitor, tower, and keyboard were fortunate; they got splashed on a bit, but didn&rsquo;t suffer any damage. My printer/scanner I&rsquo;m not so sure about; when I picked it up a good 2 or 3 cups of water ran out of it. I unplugged it and set it in the downstairs shower to drain out. I haven&rsquo;t yet tested it for damage, but I&rsquo;m not too hopeful.</p>
<p>Being as this flood occurred mid-morning, the rest of the day was spent cleaning and repairing; I replaced the various valves in the toilet and it seems to be much happier now. Two of the ceiling tiles in the basement were waterlogged beyond salvage; a quick trip to Lowe&rsquo;s found me a partial package with just the two tiles that I needed, which was a much better option than having to buy a full carton of ten. Several hours of a box fan on high speed managed to dry things out pretty well in the basement. All that really remains is for me to hang the new ceiling tiles, sweep the floor, and test out the printer.</p>
<p>Thus ends the tale of the Great New Year&rsquo;s Eve Flood of Aught-Six. Pray it never happens to you.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;m finally caught up with my trip posts. It&rsquo;s 10:20 PM and we&rsquo;re in a hotel room in Dayton, Ohio. We traveled from Waxhaw this morning, picked up my sunglasses from the Cozart&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d left them last night, then headed up through NC, Virginia, West Virginia, and most of the way through Ohio. It was actually a pretty good drive, not too tough, went pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We stopped in West Virginia at a Cracker Barrel for lunch. I&rsquo;d never been in West Virginia before today. Well, not quite true; I think our college choir bus went through that little arm of WV and the little arm of Maryland on our way to Pennsylvania one year, but that hardly counts. Anyway, maybe the Cracker Barrel experience today wasn&rsquo;t totally representative of WV and its people and culture, but maybe it is&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just take it as a data point. So, we&rsquo;re all familiar with the stereotypes of West Virginia and its people; of uncultured inbred toothless hillbillies&hellip; you get the idea. The funny part today was this: had I gone into that restaurant with no preconceived stereotypes about West Virginians, the ideas I&rsquo;d have picked up in that hour would have pretty well matched the preconception I already had. I saw more people without teeth, in bib overalls, and/or just plain scary looking in one hour in that Cracker Barrel than I have seen in a month of Sundays at home. (Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I wasn&rsquo;t fearful or anything&hellip; more just amused.)</p>
<p>Over the Rhine graced the CD player this afternoon in honor of our Ohio travels, and tonight we hit a shopping mall to stretch our legs and eat some supper. Tomorrow morning I think we&rsquo;ll be hitting the local Tim Horton&rsquo;s in honor of my favorite Canadian *Dan (who speaks so highly of them!), then it&rsquo;s back onto the interstate through Indiana, Illinois, and finally into Iowa. It will be good to be home.</p>

			 <p>Thursday was get-ready-to-head-home day. We picked up a cartop carrier that Ernie had salvaged for us. It is in excellent shape, and with all the post-Christmas shopping Becky did, it&rsquo;s a good thing we have it! There&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;d have fit all the stuff into the van. Then we started packing up to go home. Can&rsquo;t believe we brought so much stuff along. Seriously, we took the back seat out of the Caravan, and it&rsquo;s still packed up nearly to the ceiling, then we have the cartop carrier almost full, too. Goodness.</p>
<p>Thursday evening we headed in to Charlotte to meet some of our &ldquo;weird internet friends&rdquo; for supper and to hang out. We met Brandon, his wife Sarah, and Andrea at <a href="http://www.penguindrivein.com/">The Penguin</a> near downtown Charlotte. The Penguin is a nice hole-in-the-wall place; very small, very loud, very eclectic. The jukebox would be playing heavy metal one minute and jazz the next. Very unpredictable. The burgers were good, and the specialty that we had to try was deep-fried dill pickle chips. They were fantastic.</p>
<p>After supper we went back to Brandon and Sarah&rsquo;s apartment for dessert and to watch Brandon&rsquo;s beloved Texas A&amp;M Aggies who were playing Cal in a bowl game. The Aggies ended up losing. Sorry, Brandon. We ended up getting back to Waxhaw about 11 PM. It was a fun night, fun to finally meet some people we interact with online all the time. And yes, they&rsquo;re normal people&hellip; not weirdos&hellip; just like I&rsquo;m a normal, non-weird person. Heh. :-)</p>

			 <p>The day after Christmas found us trying to sleep off all that food we ate the day before. :-) We enjoyed leftovers for breakfast and lunch, again ate too much food. We played Upwards for the first time. It&rsquo;s like Scrabble, but gives you the opportunity to stack letters on top of other letters to make new words&hellip; kinda fun.</p>
<p>We took a little walk and Brandi drove herself and Laura around the yard in her little battery-powered Corvette.</p>
<p>Then late afternoon came and it was time to pack up and head back to Waxhaw. We just barely fit everything into the Suburban. Traffic was kinda heavy but we made it back and crashed. Another enjoyable day. Pictures below.</p>

			 <p>Christmas morning dawned and we packed up four adults, two small children, and lots of presents and luggage into the folks' Suburban and headed up to Faith and Ernie&rsquo;s home in Conover, NC. It was just about a 2-hour drive from Waxhaw - not bad at all. This gave Laura the first chance to meet her cousin Brandi, and oh, did they ever have fun. Brandi is almost 5. Faith and Ernie adopted her from China 3 years ago. She is a sweetie.</p>
<p>We opened presents and presents and more presents. Every time it seemed like we might be done, Ernie would find some more presents under the tree and we&rsquo;d keep opening them. I can&rsquo;t begin to keep track of what all I received; Becky is actually sitting right now documenting it all as I write this blog post&hellip; at least that way I&rsquo;ll be able to write thank-yous! The one memorable thing I&rsquo;ll mention here is a refrigerator magnet from Becky&rsquo;s sister Cynthia; it has a cartoon of the Mona Lisa holding a fish in one hand, with the title &ldquo;The DaVinci Cod&rdquo;. Hehehe. [Edit: Becky corrects me that this magnet was given to her folks, not to me. :-( Still, it is pretty cool.]</p>
<p>After that came Christmas dinner, and Faith had prepared enough for an army. We ate leftovers again on Tuesday and there was still far too much left over. But it was sure tasty. The rest of Christmas day was just a crash day; we watched some football, took naps, and enjoyed watching the girls play. God has certainly blessed us richly with family, friends, and material goods. I, for one, need to step back more often and realize how blessed I am.</p>

			 <p>Sunday morning of our trip brought us to <a href="http://www.calvarychurch.com/">Calvary Church</a> in Charlotte for the Sunday morning service. It is Becky&rsquo;s folks' church, and she attended and was an intern there while in college. Then in 1998 we got married in the chapel there&hellip; so I guess we have a little history at the church. :-) We got there early so Becky could see a few people she hasn&rsquo;t seen in a while&hellip; and of course she could show off the girls.</p>
<p>After church we pigged out on Sonny&rsquo;s BBQ, which has some phenomenal sweet tea. Then it was back to Waxhaw for an afternoon nap, and then the traditional Christmas Eve feast with Becky&rsquo;s folks. Then it was off to bed for the girls as we packed up to head to Faith &amp; Ernie&rsquo;s for Christmas&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Day 4 of our trip (Saturday the 23rd) was a nice day to catch up. After sleeping in, we had a late breakfast with Becky&rsquo;s folks. Or, I should say rather <em>at</em> Becky&rsquo;s folks' place; I&rsquo;m sure they had eaten hours before we got there. :-) The girls had some time to play with toys, and we helped prepare some food for Christmas dinner. Then in early afternoon while the girls were taking naps, Becky and I headed in to Charlotte to do a little shopping.</p>
<p>Charlotte is growing like crazy these days. There are new Target stores and Harris Teeter grocery stores seemingly every 2 miles or so. We stopped at one of those Target stores to pick up a few things. While there, Becky and I were browsing the toy aisles and noticed a little girl probably 4 years old with her parents in tow. She noticed a large stuffed pink unicorn slouching on the lowest shelf and told her father she wanted to get it. Without missing a beat, her father replied, &ldquo;oh, but it&rsquo;s asleep. Never buy a unicorn when it&rsquo;s sleeping.&rdquo; And that was the end of it. No questions why, no discussion; I imagine the little girl had something to think about for the rest of the afternoon. It was all Becky and I could do to make it &lsquo;round the corner to the next aisle before breaking into hilarious laughter. I can only hope I&rsquo;ll be that quick on the mental draw when Laura gets a bit bigger. :-)</p>
<p>Saturday night after supper we put the girls to bed and then Becky&rsquo;s folks came over and we played games for a while; first several rounds of Sequence, then a few games of Pass the Pigs, which was a new one to me, but is basically a little dice game with specially-designed plastic pigs in place of dice. Then it was off to bed in preparation for church on Sunday.</p>

			 <p>Day 3 was another travel day; Nashville, TN to Waxhaw, NC. It doesn&rsquo;t look that long on the map, but it winds through the mountains a good bit, which makes it longer. It&rsquo;s a very pretty drive.</p>
<p>We got packed up and left the Opryland resort about 8:30. Taking I-40 east, we headed through Knoxville and then wound our way through the mountains to Asheville, NC. It was rainy and foggy all day, which made for some beautiful views of clouds hanging low in the mountain valleys, but it also made for some difficult driving. Still, we made it to Charlotte in time for supper and then drove the 40 minutes on to Waxhaw to see Becky&rsquo;s folks.</p>
<p>We hung out at their apartment for a little while and had some dessert (Laura just loves her ice cream!), then they took us over to the little JAARS apartment that we&rsquo;re staying in. The JAARS headquarters here actually is set up with several lodges and apartments to house folks that come in for training and the like. They&rsquo;re also available for visitors, which works quite well for us. We&rsquo;re actually in an apartment that has two bedrooms, one bath, living room, dining room, and small kitchen. Laura slept in a real twin-sized bed, a real step up from her toddler bed at home. She did really well. It&rsquo;s nice to have a little home-away-from-home where we can just settle down at night. (It even has DSL so I can get my internet fix!)</p>
<p>Fortunately we won&rsquo;t be doing much more driving for a day or two; Sunday we&rsquo;ll head into Charlotte for church, then Monday we head up to Conover to visit Ernie, Faith, and Brandy for Christmas. I&rsquo;ll try to keep my blog posts up-to-date since I know some of my family will be reading them while they&rsquo;re together in Chicago at Ryan&rsquo;s place. Hi guys!</p>

			 <p>Day 2 of our Christmas trip landed us in Nashville. Becky&rsquo;s brother Bob and his wife Holly and daughter Taylor live just south of town. Holly works for Gaylord Entertainment, which operates the massive <a href="http://www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylordopryland/">Opryland Resort</a> there in northeast Nashville. As such, she gets a phenomenal discount rate for rooms in the hotel, and we took full advantage of that to stay there for two nights.</p>
<p>We slept in (a necessity after staying up &lsquo;til midnight) and then went with Bobby and Taylor to a local Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Then it was back to the resort and we started walking around. The place is amazing. They have two domed areas with multiple levels of attractions, shows, shops, and gardens. One has an indoor river with boat tours! Bob had lined up a boat tour for us and off we went.</p>
<p>At lunchtime I was able to get together with <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> to grab lunch. He was getting ready to record some background vocals for another guy that afternoon, and they were heading out for lunch first. I joined them for lunch at a local Irish pub-type establishment (I call it that knowing that Ryan would be happy to tell me how different a <em>true</em> Irish pub is from that place!), then went back to the studio and hung out for a while while Andy recorded. Mitch Dean (who has worked on albums for Jars of Clay, among others) was doing the recording, and it was an education for me to see just how the process works. It was difficult, if not impossible, to resist the geek appeal of all that sound recording and editing gear, and that doesn&rsquo;t even begin to address the enjoyment I had as a musician seeing how songs get sculpted into a finished product.</p>
<p>I headed back to the resort mid-afternoon and we walked around and saw more of the sights. The place is just designed to soak your money out of you. They have a Chick-Fil-A inside one of the domes. The price for a basic CFA sandwich? $6. At a normal CFA, it costs about $2.50. Add on the $10/day to park, the add-ons for the extras in your room, and I know I couldn&rsquo;t afford to stay there at normal prices. Oh, a word about the room we stayed in. It was actually a three-room suite, two bedrooms, each with two double beds, and then a connecting sitting room that was huge; perhaps 20 x 30 feet. Each room had windows that opened out to the dome with the river, so you could hear rushing water all night. Amazing. Bob said it usually runs about $550/night. He got it for just a tiny percentage of that price, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>That night after Holly got off work we went and saw the &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; show right next door; it was a big building full of ice sculptures, and included two big ice slides! They issued you large coats at the door; the single-degree temps inside were in stark contrast to the 60-degree temps outside. Laura was a bit scared, but went down one of the slides. Unfortunately, the picture didn&rsquo;t come out. There was an amazing ice nativity scene, of course an igloo, a bear ice fishing, a train&hellip; very cool stuff. (Pun intended.)</p>
<p>Finally, we went over to the massive shopping mall next to the resort to grab dinner. We ate at the Rain Forest Cafe, which has a waterfall, massive aquariums, animatronic elephants and apes, simulated thunderstorms, the whole bit. The food was pretty decent, too. We finally made it back to our room and collapsed into bed. Well, I guess I collapsed; Becky went down with Bob to hang out for a while and listen to a band.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just add the rest of the pictures here at the end; the descriptions on Flickr will fill in any info you need.</p>

			 <p>At least it sure feels that way.</p>
<p>Day 1 of our little Christmas adventure turned out to be a bit more adventurous than we had hoped. I had the van all packed Tuesday night, and Wednesday morning we were up early and ready to take off. About 7:15 I went out to start the van to get it warmed up, and <em>click-click-click-click-click-click-click</em>. Wouldn&rsquo;t start. Nada. Finally got it jump-started, and not knowing what might be wrong, took it down to the mechanic who managed to sneak it in. After checking things over, he diagnosed a weak battery, so we had it replaced and were finally on our way about 3 hours behind schedule.</p>
<p>After one false start (forgot the phone chargers at home, go back 4 miles to get them), we were on our way south. Actually more east first, through eastern Iowa and Illinois. I think we managed to take one of the slowest routes to Nashville. It looks straight enough on the map, but take a little hint from me and Messrs. Rand and McNally: the blue roads travel faster than the orange roads. Blue roads don&rsquo;t have stoplights. Blue roads don&rsquo;t force you to slow down to 30 mph for small towns. I will not forget this lesson.</p>
<p>We stopped at a Cracker Barrel somewhere in Illinois for lunch, and at an Arby&rsquo;s in Vincennes, IN for supper. We ended up getting to Nashville about 10:15 pm. We are staying at the Opryland resort, which is just amazing. I&rsquo;ll post more about it tomorrow, along with lots of pics.</p>

			 <p>The long-awaited Christmas break is finally here! Tonight we&rsquo;re loading the van, and tomorrow morning we head out bright and early for our Christmas visit to see Becky&rsquo;s family in Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Wednesday will take us to Nashville. We&rsquo;ll spend all day Thursday there with her brother Bobby and his family, then Friday morning we&rsquo;ll take off for North Carolina. We&rsquo;ll spend the next several days alternating between Becky&rsquo;s folks' place in Waxhaw and her sister&rsquo;s place in Conover. We&rsquo;ll meet some weird internet friends on Thursday night in Charlotte, then Friday morning we head back home, taking two days to get back to Iowa. At the moment we&rsquo;re planning on overnighting in Dayton, OH on the way back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be good to get away from work for a couple of weeks, spend some major time with Becky and the girls, see some of her family that we haven&rsquo;t seen in a long time. Hey, I&rsquo;ll probably post more often over the next two weeks than I usually do - lots of good chances to take pictures and lots of new stories to tell.</p>

			 <p>Found this wonderful little article from Will Willimon entitled <a href="http://willimon.blogspot.com/2006/12/resisting-clutches-of-consumerism.html">&ldquo;Resisting the Clutches of Consumerism&rdquo;</a>. A good read, especially this time of year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;the “user friendly” approach to church won’t work. There is no way to entice people off the streets with hymns that are based on advertising jingles and end up with the cross-bearing, self-sacrificial, burden-bearing Jesus. Evangelism cannot be based upon our basic selfishness (“Come to Jesus and get everything you want fixed.”) and end up with anything resembling historic Christianity.</p>

<p>Good stuff, for sure. Go read the whole thing.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s taken me far too long, but I have finally completed the second book on my user-suggested reading list: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1573229881%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1573229881%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">The Russian Debutante&rsquo;s Handbook</a></em> by Gary Shteyngart. Thanks to <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof</a> for the recommendation.</p>
<p>Geof described <em>Handbook</em> as &ldquo;Great absurdist immigrant fiction.&rdquo; He was right. <em>The Russian Debutante&rsquo;s Handbook</em> is a hilariously absurd story of a Russian immigrant living in New York. It follows the (mis)adventures in his personal and public lives as he deals with family and romantic relationships, jobs, and schemes. If it sounds like I&rsquo;m grasping for the right words to describe the story, it&rsquo;s because I am. This book was unlike pretty much anything else I&rsquo;ve ever read. It was amusing and charmingly absurd. While I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it to all of my readers, if you&rsquo;re looking for something different, this may just be the thing. Thanks again, Geof!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to hit the library again this week to stock up for the trip to North Carolina. I&rsquo;ll definitely grab a couple more from the list.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the question that was posed to me this morning. Now, it was just at the local Quik Trip store that&rsquo;s on the way to work, but still, it made me think a bit.</p>
<p>The details of me having a &ldquo;usual&rdquo; are unremarkable. I am in the habit of stopping at that QT every morning on the way to work sometime between 6:30 and 7:00 AM. I have an older 52 oz mug that I fill with Diet Pepsi from the fountain. I usually add a shot of cherry syrup to sweeten it a bit. They upped the price on me several months ago; it now costs $0.93 once the state of Iowa taxes it.</p>
<p>So this morning I didn&rsquo;t have to say &ldquo;refill&rdquo; or &ldquo;yeah, it&rsquo;s pop&rdquo; (apparently some folks refill a 52 oz mug with coffee! Yikes!) - as I walked up to the counter, the guy said &ldquo;just the usual?&rdquo; and I said &ldquo;yep&rdquo; and handed him a dollar. Actually, I set the dollar on the counter; he was already pulling my seven cents of change out of the cash drawer.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word I&rsquo;m heading towards here with this story, and that word is <em>community</em>. Now sure, maybe it&rsquo;s a stretch to say that the Quik Trip guy knowing what I usually get is community. (Maybe it&rsquo;d be better for me if I wasn&rsquo;t drinking 50 oz of Diet Pepsi a day!) But when you start having consistency in an area to the point where you and your habits are known, and people start responding to you as a person they recognize, rather than just some random human they have to deal with today? That&rsquo;s the start of an opportunity for a relationship; one that builds community and provides opportunities to interact about more meaningful things.</p>
<p>My hope is two-fold. First, that I will be a part of a community long enough that people will know me and what I am about. Second, that what I am about will be more meaningful than large daily doses of liquefied caffeine.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been far too long since I&rsquo;ve written much here on the blog; it&rsquo;s been a busy week or two. While not a full remedy, a brief update will at least catch you up to speed on Chris&rsquo;s life in December of 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Christmas Shopping:</strong> I have finished buying for four people; I have three left to buy for. I know pretty much what I want to buy, just haven&rsquo;t gotten to the store yet. I&rsquo;ll try to finish up early this week; that&rsquo;ll be the earliest I&rsquo;ve ever finished Christmas shopping, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>Book Reviews:</strong> For those of you who listed books for my reading list, I haven&rsquo;t forgotten you. I&rsquo;m still working through <em>The Russian Debutante&rsquo;s Handbook</em> as recommended by Geof Morris. I nearly finished it last night, but sleep got the better of me. It&rsquo;s due back at the library tomorrow, so I better finish it up tonight. It&rsquo;s been an enjoyable read, definitely a change from my usual reading fare.</p>
<p><strong>Church Stuff:</strong> I haven&rsquo;t led music in a month now, and I finally realized yesterday how nice the break has been. This was the first Sunday that I actually just showed up for church without giving any thought or concern to whether the music team was lined up and prepared. And it went just fine. Next week will break the streak; I will be leading next Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Plans:</strong> We leave a week from Wednesday (the 20th) for North Carolina. We will swing through Nashville to see Becky&rsquo;s brother and then head to Charlotte to see Becky&rsquo;s folks and sister/brother-in-law/niece. Should be a fun time, if the 20-hour drive doesn&rsquo;t kill us. :-) We should be back home by the 30th or 31st.</p>
<p>Christmas break should provide some more time for posting - I&rsquo;ll try, I promise! :-)</p>

			 <p>My mother-in-law asked the other day what I thought about this recent news story. In brief: Newly elected to the House of Representatives, Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison has declared that when he is sworn in on January 4th, he will take the oath of office with his hand on a Koran instead of a Bible. Ellison is the first Muslim ever elected to Congress.</p>
<p>There have been varying reactions to Ellison&rsquo;s decision. The loudest has been <a href="http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/DennisPrager/2006/11/28/america,_not_keith_ellison,_decides_what_book_a_congressman_takes_his_oath_on">Dennis Prager on townhall.com</a>, who declares that Ellison &ldquo;&hellip;should not be allowed to do so &ndash; not because of any American hostility to the Koran, but because the act undermines American civilization.&rdquo; A little more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forgive me, but America should not give a hoot what Keith Ellison&rsquo;s favorite book is. Insofar as a member of Congress taking an oath to serve America and uphold its values is concerned, America is interested in only one book, the Bible. If you are incapable of taking an oath on that book, don&rsquo;t serve in Congress. In your personal life, we will fight for your right to prefer any other book. We will even fight for your right to publish cartoons mocking our Bible. But, Mr. Ellison, America, not you, decides on what book its public servants take their oath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I was forwarded an email from the <a href="http://www.afa.net/aa112806_2.asp">American Family Association</a> that quoted the Prager column and then asked all the readers to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Send an email asking your U.S. Representative and Senators to pass a law making the Bible the book used in the swearing-in ceremony of Representatives and Senators.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
2. Forward this email to your friends and family today!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is my reaction to all this?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s deal with the easy one first. The AFA&rsquo;s suggestion is clearly ridiculous. Any law passed by Congress requiring the oath to be taken on a Bible would be summarily rejected by the Supreme Court as an unconstitutional establishment of religion, and rightly so. Let&rsquo;s just reverse the situation for a moment. Suppose a congressional majority of Muslims arose. Would I think it were then OK for them to mandate that all oaths be taken with a hand on the Koran? Of course not. Hence our protection of religious freedoms in the Constitution.</p>
<p>So then to the next question: what opinion do I have about Mr. Ellison&rsquo;s intention? Let&rsquo;s back up and look at the history of oath-taking in the USA. I&rsquo;m sure I could go back further, but it&rsquo;s easy to note that George Washington took the presidential oath of office on a Bible. Each President since then has taken the oath in similar fashion. The Bible is today used for oaths in a multitude of other circumstances, local and state offices, courtrooms.</p>
<p>In the initial case, President Washington used the Bible because he viewed it as a sacred book, and placing his hand on the Bible further solemnized the oath. Given the United States' Christian heritage, this understandably became a tradition that continues to this day. My fear, though, is that somewhere through the years the solemnity imbued by the sacred text has faded into a tradition that carries little of its original weight. Let&rsquo;s be certain of this: I&rsquo;m all for politicians keeping their word. Too many these days seem to lose their care for ethics and the truth once they reach Washington; if any action can reinforce to them the need to keep their oath, so much the better. But it seems to me that if the Bible is being used simply as a traditional prop by those who don&rsquo;t reverence it, it is more dishonoring than honoring to the Book. As one who believes the Bible to be the Word of God, that bothers me.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us? I have come to the conclusion that I don&rsquo;t really care. I want Rep. Ellison and each of his fellow congressmen to honor the oaths that they take. If Rep. Ellison believes that the Koran will further solemnize his oath, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with it. If a Christian congressman wants to use the Bible to solemnize his oath, he should use it. Personally, I&rsquo;d prefer that if a person doesn&rsquo;t respect or revere the Bible, they not use it at all. Let&rsquo;s not turn the Holy Book into a prop.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last Friday Becky and I headed out to Omaha, NE to see <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s</a> <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em> tour. (OK, so it was officially in Elkorn, NE, but that&rsquo;s just suburban Omaha these days.) My mom graciously agreed to come down and stay with the girls for a couple of days, so we got up Friday morning and headed west. A four-hour drive later we arrived in Omaha, checked into our hotel, ate some lunch, wandered around a mall, etc. Then we headed over to the church for the concert.</p>
<p>This is the second consecutive year that AP and company have played at <a href="http://www.bethany-lutheran.com">Bethany Lutheran</a> there in Elkhorn. It&rsquo;s a beautiful church, a good venue for a concert like this. They were all decorated for Christmas, and their sanctuary, which seats by my estimate around 600 people, was nearly full. So, a good start.</p>
<p>As we were waiting in line for the doors to be opened, one of the organizers came by with little tour fliers and informed us that the artists would be doing a meet-and-greet in the church gym after the doors opened. So, we could go in, stake out a seat, then go &ldquo;get an autograph&rdquo;. Since I have 2 autographed posters from last year&rsquo;s concert stop in Cedar Rapids, once more with a Sharpie didn&rsquo;t interest me that much; but I was looking forward to greeting some of them who I haven&rsquo;t seen since last year&rsquo;s concert. Fortunately for me, there were few attendees for the meet-and-greet, which allowed me some time to talk to Andrew Peterson, <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Andy</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.jillphillips.com">Jill (Phillips)</a> <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Gullahorn</a>, Cason Cooley, <a href="http://www.benshive.com">Ben Shive</a>, and to meet <a href="http://www.ericpeters.net">Eric Peters</a> for the first time. I found Eric to be a very personable guy and had a good time chatting with him. I had two different fans come up to me and ask which band member I was. :-) As the meet-and-greet was wrapping up, Cason dug a basketball out of a closet and he and Eric and I shot hoops for a few minutes. Those guys have some game, but I could spank &lsquo;em if it came to it - they&rsquo;re so short! (Props to Andy G for being the token tall guy on the tour, he&rsquo;s my height; come to think of it, I guess AP is fairly tall as well. But Derek, Sandra, Cason, Eric, Jill? Short. All of em. :-) )</p>
<p>The concert itself was phenomenal as expected. The first half was the usual &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; of songs from each individual. Each time one of them finished a song, I was thinking &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s gonna be hard to top&hellip;&rdquo;. And then the next person would come up and be just as good, if not better. The second half, as usual, was the <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em> album, played straight through. I will confess to missing <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a>, who is back home in Nashville with his due-any-day wife, but Andy G filled in admirably on the electric guitar. Good stuff, all the way through. (If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this album, you can stream it live from Andy&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">www.andrew-peterson.com</a>.)</p>
<p>After the concert I spent too much money at the merch table buying Christmas presents and a few albums to fill out my collection. They had a <a href="http://squarepegalliance.com">Square Peg Alliance</a> t-shirt, but it came in only one color: Powder Blue. This guy doesn&rsquo;t look good in Powder Blue. Maybe you can do a more neutral color next time, folks?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve yet to download the pics from the camera to see if any of them turned out; if they did I&rsquo;ll put them up on Flickr and link them here.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;I’ve noticed that when God wants me to follow Him in a particular direction, He usually doesn’t get me to do it by sending people to scream at me, argue with me, threaten me or poke me with sticks.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve completed the first book off of my user-suggested reading list: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0312979479%26tag=caedmonscalln-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0312979479%253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon">And Then There Were None</a></em> by Agatha Christie. Thanks to Heather for the recommendation!</p>
<p>This was my first time reading anything by Agatha Christie. My only previous exposure to her work was when I watched the movie adaption of <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>. That seems to have been a good preparation; much of the style in the plot development seems similar between the two. The formula: introduce the characters, put them in a tightly-defined scenario. Provide a character to narrate and work the reader through the logical options in the whodunit. Get to the end of the story with no good answer. Then provide an epilogue that reveals the twist that makes it all clear. Formulaic or not, it works - it kept me up a ways past my bedtime to finish it last night.</p>
<p><em>And Then There Were None</em> (originally titled <em>Ten Little Indians</em>) sets ten diverse characters on an isolated island. Their supposed &ldquo;host&rdquo; is nowhere to be found. One by one, the ten guests are killed&hellip; but who is killing them? This is the mystery, and it&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>A quick IMDB search shows that <em>And Then There Were None</em> has also been adapted into a movie at least three times; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037515/">once in 1945</a>, starring, most notably, Walter Huston. It was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061075/">updated in 1965</a> and moved out of its original time period. Then it was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072263/">remade once again in 1974</a>, with a cast that included Sir Richard Attenborough. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of these versions, but I will take a look next time I go to the video store. Might be interesting.</p>
<p>My next stop on the reading list: Gary Shteyngart&rsquo;s <em>The Russian Debutante’s Handbook</em>, as recommended by <a href="http://gfmorris.net">Geof Morris</a>.</p>

			 <p>The past two mornings Laura has decided there was a need to wake up about ten minutes to five; both times she had lost her pacifier and couldn&rsquo;t get back to sleep. (We need to find the little attachment device for it again.) Both days this has been about 20 minutes before my alarm was set to go off anyway. Amazingly I&rsquo;m not too tired yet from the lack of sleep.</p>
<p>What has been nice is that it&rsquo;s had me up and ready to go hit the mini-MAC in the mornings. The MAC is our local athletic club, and while they chintz on <a href="http://the-mac0.tripod.com/">their website</a> (it&rsquo;s hosted for free on&hellip; wait for it&hellip; <a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a>! What is this, 1996?), their club locations are nothing to sneeze at. They just opened an &ldquo;express&rdquo; MAC about a mile from our house. You get a key card and 24/7 access. There are 8 or so each of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, and then a full Nautilus weight set. Each of the aerobic machines has a 13-inch LCD TV attached so you can plug in your headphones and choose your own channel. So far it&rsquo;s worked pretty well to start the morning with a quick trip over to the MAC and a half hour on some machine. I did the elliptical this morning and I&rsquo;m starting to feel it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now approaching 7:30 and the office is finally starting to wake up. I love getting in at 6:45 and having some quiet time to work in the mornings. I also love the fact that it facilitates my leaving work around 3:15 in the afternoon. :-) Having two girls under 3 years old has pretty much prevented any sleeping in these days, but I&rsquo;m learning that it&rsquo;s an OK thing - a morning is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

			 <p>So how was your Thanksgiving? We spent the weekend in Wisconsin with my family at my parents' place. It was the first time we&rsquo;ve had everybody together in about a year. We ate far too much, shopped a little, played lots of Speed Scrabble, and I did some reading. We made it home last night about 5 PM, in time to get unpacked and get the girls to bed. It was a great time, wonderful to see everybody again.</p>
<p>Becky says we&rsquo;re building up endurance for road trips over the next month or so. The trip to Wisconsin is only about a three-hour drive. Not too bad. Now this Friday we&rsquo;re headed for Omaha (to see the Andrew Peterson Christmas concert!), which is just over four hours away. But those drives will all be wimpy in comparison to the road trip we&rsquo;ll be taking in three weeks, a mere 20 hours to the great state of North Carolina. Fortunately, we&rsquo;ll split it up over 3 days on the way down there, two 10-hour days plus a day in Nashville in between driving. By the time we get home on New Years' we&rsquo;ll be ready to stay home for a while, methinks.</p>
<p>I should note that I am not opposed to road trips - <a href="/06/06/road-trip-andy-o-cd-release-show/">I have taken long ones in the past</a>. But it&rsquo;ll be a whole different experience with a 2-and-a-half-year-old and a nine-month-old occupying the two back seats in the van. We will get some mileage out of the portable DVD player for sure.</p>
<p><em>The road goes ever on and on&hellip;</em></p>

			 <p>With Thanksgiving being tomorrow, I thought I&rsquo;d list a few things I&rsquo;m thankful for. I encourage you to think about it and make your own list!</p>
<p><strong>Family.</strong> I have had more opportunity this year to spend time with my brothers, sister, and parents than I have in several years. What a blessing to have a family that loves each other, loves God, enjoys making music together and living life together, and has so much fun doing all of it. Closer to home, nay, at home, we are one more in number than we were last Thanksgiving; it&rsquo;s hard to believe little Addie Grace is over 8 months old now. What a blessing to have a loving wife and precious daughters.</p>
<p><strong>Skilled Doctors.</strong> This one hit home a couple of weeks ago when I had to take Becky to the ER. It was one in the morning, she was very sick, I was very concerned and tired. What a blessing to have a wonderful nurse and doctor who were skilled and kind. That someone would pay for years of education just to get a job where they have to work overnights all so they can care for hurting people? Blessings on them.</p>
<p><strong>God&rsquo;s Provision.</strong> The leadership at Noelridge planned and encouraged a special Thanksgiving offering this year. We were all encouraged to seek God&rsquo;s guidance in what He would have us give and then to trust Him to supply it. Our goal was $12,000, which is more than 3x what we receive on a normal Sunday, over and above regular giving. We took the offering last Sunday and the Lord provided over $15,000 in the special offering, <em>on top of</em> the regular offering. Praise Him!</p>
<p><strong>Old Friends.</strong> <a href="http://lydiapresley.blogspot.com">Lydia</a> and I were friends back in Jr High. When our family moved to Texas it pretty much put the damper on that and we drifted apart. I last saw her in 1994, and hadn&rsquo;t heard from her in several years. But she tracked me down a couple of years ago and we have corresponded from time to time. Finally, last Sunday, she and her sister Candace made the three-hour trek from Illinois to Iowa to visit for a day. It was fun to meet Candace, to introduce Lydia to Becky and the girls, and to spend an afternoon catching up.</p>
<p><strong>Good Music.</strong> Did you really think I could write a blog post without mentioning music of some sort? I will ridicule all the radio stations playing wall-to-wall Christmas music already, but I must confess I have had Christmas music of a sort playing repeatedly over the past few weeks. The sort in question isn&rsquo;t your traditional Christmas stuff, but rather is <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s</a> wonderful <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em>. (You can stream the whole album from his website. Go listen to it.) The truth of the Christmas story told in an original way. Becky and I are headed to Omaha on December 1st to see Andrew and his huge cast of friends perform it. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of what could be a really long list. Lord, remind me to be thankful every day, not just once a year.</p>

			 <p>This Sunday will be my last Sunday to lead worship at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a> for a while. It has been a while since <a href="/06/09/things-are-changing/">I made the official announcement</a>, and I think in the interim some good strides have been made to get things organized and prepared for my departure. I&rsquo;m sure there will still be some kinks to work out, some things I&rsquo;ve forgotten and the like, but they&rsquo;ll get the figured out, and I&rsquo;ll be available to answer questions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the break. Suddenly my Monday afternoons are free from staff meetings (though I may still attend from time to time), my Tuesday nights are free from planning services, my Wednesday nights are free from worship team practice, and my Sunday mornings are now flexible so I can attend one service of my choice. There will definitely be some schedule adjustment, I think for the better.</p>
<p>So, this Sunday is the last one. We&rsquo;re celebrating the church&rsquo;s 50th anniversary this week. We&rsquo;ll have a few of the former pastors in attendance, and a bunch of old-timers. Should be a neat time.</p>

			 <p>Those of you who know me know that I am a voracious reader. (Those of you who don&rsquo;t know me just found out.) Every night for many years I have spent my last waking hour in bed reading some book or another. (If the book is too interesting, I spend a few of my last waking hours in bed&hellip; and often end up short on sleep as a result.) I enjoy many genres, but find myself most drawn to history, theology, science fiction (but not the fantasy branch of sci-fi so much), and then military/adventure novels. I was big into Tom Clancy as a kid, and branched out to similar authors when Clancy&rsquo;s pen dried up.</p>
<p>I average 1 or 2 books per week, depending on how busy my week is. Lately, though, I have become weary of my regular diet of mindless adventure. Much of it is tired retreads. I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my time. Back at the DG2006 conference I bought G. K. Chesterton&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Man-G-K-Chesterton/dp/0898704448/sr=8-1/qid=1163513393/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0755405-0088815?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">The Everlasting Man</a></em> and I&rsquo;m enjoying it quite a lot. But it, too, will soon join the ranks of books I&rsquo;ve already read, and I&rsquo;ll be looking for something else.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal. Do you have any books to recommend that I read? They could be fiction, non-fiction, whatever. Just something you think I&rsquo;d enjoy or benefit from. Leave a comment with the name and author of the book. In return, I will find them at the local library, read them, and then post my thoughts about the book. Sound like a plan?</p>

			 <p>Well, that Happy Meal hasn&rsquo;t materialized in Laura&rsquo;s future yet. Becky got sick with a nasty fever and such on Thursday, so she had to cancel her trip to Chicago for this weekend. I know she was very disappointed, but what can you do?</p>
<p>She did get to come along, though, to a <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a> house show last night, and it was excellent. I much prefer to hear Randall&rsquo;s music live rather than from his CDs - it&rsquo;s a whole different sound, less production, less extra instruments. He and his wife Amy did most of the songs with just a guitar, and it sounded great. He also did several piano songs, showing off his skill as a jazz pianist, and then left no eye dry with a stunning late-night piano version of <em>Next To You</em>. I found that I have his recorded version of the song on a CD at home, but with the upped tempo, drum track, and production, it sounds nothing like the version we heard last night. So Randall, buddy, think about recording an album that sounds a little more like your live stuff sometime, huh? Just a thought.</p>
<p>It has been a lazy sleep-in morning here this morning, and will continue to be a lazy Saturday. I sense some football games on TV in my future&hellip;</p>

They&rsquo;re going to see Blue Man Group while they&rsquo;re in town, which makes me a bit jealous. But that&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>So, from Friday morning until Sunday afternoon, I will be spending a lot of quality time with my two little girls. (I will get a little break on Friday night when my sister watches the kids while my brother and I go to a <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a> house show&hellip;) Everyone who hears that I&rsquo;ve got the kids for the weekend asks me if I think I&rsquo;ll survive. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the big deal is - isn&rsquo;t a Dad supposed to be able to manage for a day or two with the wife gone? Sure, we&rsquo;ll be ready to have Becky back on Sunday, but I&rsquo;m glad she can go. Goodness knows I&rsquo;m gone often enough. Seems only fair that she should get to go when the occasions arise.</p>
<p>I sense a Happy Meal in Laura&rsquo;s future for this weekend. :-)</p>

			 <p>Yep, it&rsquo;s election day. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m too excited about any of the slate of candidates I have to vote for here in Iowa; some of the locals are probably alright, but even at the state level they&rsquo;ve been slinging mud for so many weeks now I have a bad taste in my mouth - something akin to that nasty pastiness you get when sleeping with your mouth open all night when your nose is clogged. Yecch.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;ll be heading to the polling place after work to do my part as a citizen. I urge you to do the same.</p>
<p>Note to my dad, who&rsquo;s running the poll for his township in Wisconsin: hope it goes well.</p>

			 <p>Dr. John Stackhouse of <a href="http://www.regent-college.edu/">Regent College</a> in Vancouver, BC, is in Cedar Rapids this weekend speaking. He&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://www.coe.edu">Coe College</a> tonight, First Lutheran Church tomorrow night, and then at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a> and First Lutheran on Sunday morning. (Visit <a href="http://www.recminusa.org">recminusa.org</a> for more details.)</p>
<p>I got to meet him at lunch today. I was invited to a regular lunch meeting that my pastor has with some musician-types each Thursday, and Dr. Stackhouse was invited to join us all for lunch. He is a fascinating man; seeming to be equally conversant in music, politics, religion, and philosophy, he bantered with the group all the while engaging us in some serious thought.</p>
<p>At one point the discussion turned to politics, and one of the regulars was lamenting that so many people have started to view politics as single-issues; they&rsquo;ll make their voting decision based strictly on a candidate&rsquo;s view on, say, abortion, or gay rights. It&rsquo;s frustrating to those of us who think there are multiple issues that are important. Dr. Stackhouse agreed that it is very difficult; in reality there may be 30 or 40 issues that a thinking person could be versed on, and vote around. What he suggested, though, was that pastors and other leaders should encourage their people to think around a rather short list, perhaps five or six issues that as Christians we should care about.</p>
<p>He only listed two for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will this issue affect the poor?</li>
<li>How will this issue affect our ability to freely share the gospel?</li>
</ul>
<p>He suggested that there might be just a few more. What do you think? Is this a reasonable framework around which to decide how votes will be cast? What items would you add to the list?</p>

			 <p>So I don&rsquo;t listen to Christian radio any more, but Becky had it on in the van over the weekend, and on Sunday morning when I started the van to head to church, this song came on, and it&rsquo;s driving me crazy. I&rsquo;ve been frustrated with shallow and trite lyrics before, but I think this song takes the cake. To be fair, I&rsquo;ll quote the whole song:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people tell me that I look kind of funny<br>
My nose is red and the braces didn&rsquo;t work at all<br>
They say the clothes I wear are all out of fashion<br>
I don&rsquo;t fit in and should be shopping at a different mall<br>
I studied classical piano when I could&rsquo;ve been playing guitar<br>
I used to drive an El Camino and I&rsquo;m not even sure it&rsquo;s a car
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(chorus)<br>
I&rsquo;m not cool but that&rsquo;s okay<br>
My God loves me anyway<br>
I&rsquo;m not cool but that&rsquo;s alright<br>
I&rsquo;m still precious in His sight<br>
I&rsquo;m not cool but I don&rsquo;t care<br>
How I&rsquo;m supposed to do my hair<br>
I&rsquo;m not cool but that&rsquo;s okay<br>
My God loves me anyway<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I know all the lingo<br>
He doesn&rsquo;t mind if I&rsquo;m not hanging with a certain crowd<br>
Some people still believe in building image<br>
≥ But I am fine and that&rsquo;s a worry I can do without<br>
I used to wish I was athletic but football was never my game<br>
I met some friends in mathematics but no one can spell my last name<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
chorus<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
He says that I am one of a kind<br>
And I don&rsquo;t have to try to be somebody else<br>
He believes in me and says I&rsquo;m free to be myself<br>
I can be myself<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
(<em>I&rsquo;m Not Cool</em> - Scott Krippayne)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Becky has warned me that ripping on this song will just make me come across as a music snob. I&rsquo;m probably guilty as charged&hellip; but I&rsquo;ve gotta say <em>something</em>. In no particular order:</p>
<p>First thought: <strong>This could be the theme song for all of Christian Radio these days.</strong> The music they play is so out-of-date and repetitive&hellip; don&rsquo;t get me started. It&rsquo;s the same stuff I was hearing on Christian radio when I listened to it back in high school. And I graduated high school in 1995.</p>
<p>Second thought: <strong>There&rsquo;s a fine line between saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s OK if I&rsquo;m not cool&rdquo; and saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to be culturally relevant&rdquo;.</strong> I understand what Krippayne is trying to say with the song. It&rsquo;s supposed to be an encouragement to that poor socially-inept person who feels &ldquo;uncool&rdquo; and rejected by their peers. OK, great. But it&rsquo;s a very short trip from that to saying &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether I&rsquo;m in touch culturally or not&rdquo;, which is a much shakier proposition. It seems to me that we <em>do</em> need to be culturally relevant; we&rsquo;re not doing the Gospel any favors by intimating that only geeks and losers believe. Yeah, there&rsquo;s a balance to be struck, but this song takes me way out past the edge of where I&rsquo;m comfortable balancing.</p>
<p>Third thought: <strong>If it&rsquo;s really OK to be uncool, why are the words and music written in a style that is attempting to be contemporary?</strong> Why not write it as a Gregorian chant or as Uzbekistani folk music or as hideous 70&rsquo;s disco? Apparently it&rsquo;s OK to be uncool unless you&rsquo;re a CCM musician. Then you&rsquo;ve gotta try to be, but the odds are you&rsquo;ll fail miserably.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t deny that the basic message of the song (&ldquo;God loves me just as I am&rdquo;) is true; it&rsquo;s really the insipidity that kills me. Let me share, in closing, a song that does a far better job at eloquently sharing the wonder of God&rsquo;s love for us. Brother Scott, you might take a lesson or two from <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=36">Andrew Peterson</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s that on the ground?<br>
It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s left of my heart<br>
Somebody named Jesus<br>
Broke it to pieces<br>
And planted the shards<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And they&rsquo;re coming up green<br>
They&rsquo;re coming in bloom<br>
I can hardly believe<br>
This is all coming true<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Just as I am and just as I was<br>
Just as I will be He loves me, He does<br>
He showed me the day that He shed His own blood<br>
He loves me, oh, He loves me, He does<br>

All of my life I&rsquo;ve held on to this fear<br>
Its thistles and vines<br>
Ensnare and entwine<br>
What flowers appeared<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It&rsquo;s the fear that I&rsquo;ll fall<br>
One too many times<br>
It&rsquo;s the fear that His love<br>
Is no better than mine<br>

It&rsquo;s time now to harvest<br>
What little that grew<br>
This man they call Jesus<br>
Who planted the seeds<br>
Has come for the fruit<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And the best that I&rsquo;ve got<br>
Isn&rsquo;t nearly enough<br>
He&rsquo;s glad for the crop<br>
But it&rsquo;s me that He loves<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Just as I am and just as I was<br>
Just as I will be He loves me, He does<br>
The same as the day that He shed His own blood<br>
He loves me, oh, He loves me, He does<br>

			 <p>Yard work isn&rsquo;t my favorite task; it&rsquo;s one of those things that gets done because it needs to be done, not because I really want to do it. But there is something increasingly pleasant about the pattern of life as I see it develop year after year. This will be our third autumn in this house, and so the third season of cold afternoons raking until dark, brisk Saturdays cleaning out gutters, and warm cups of tea waiting for me back in the house. When the raking gets long I will take comfort in the knowledge that in just a few weeks all the leaves will have fallen, the bags will have been collected, and all that will remain in this year&rsquo;s outdoor maintenance is to prepare the snowblower for its season of work.</p>
<p>They say time speeds up as you get older, and I can understand why they say so. Children have a particular way of making time fly. Wasn&rsquo;t it just yesterday that little girl was born? Today she sits up on her own, sports two teeth, and grabs everything in sight. Wasn&rsquo;t it just recently I graduated from college? And yet the new grads at work this year look like mere children. When did I get old? What I am starting to see, though, is the joy in the patterns of life across the years.</p>
<p>Laura is old enough to attend Sunday School this fall, and she came up a few weeks ago chattering &ldquo;day, night. day, night&rdquo;. She&rsquo;s learned about all the other things God created, too, but she has been stuck on &ldquo;day, night&rdquo;. At night when we pray I&rsquo;ve been reinforcing to her that we&rsquo;re praying to God who made day and night, sun, moon and stars (also favorites of hers!), and who made her. At her young age, I&rsquo;m sure &ldquo;day, night&rdquo; seems like a long time; but even now she can start to learn the patterns that God has so beautifully designed for us. And before too long she&rsquo;ll be out helping rake the leaves, mow the grass, and shovel the snow.</p>
<p>Writing this suddenly I feel old. I can take some short-lived comfort in the knowledge that my 30th birthday is still nearly 5 months off, but I know that it will come all too soon. (Some of my readers will say that 30 isn&rsquo;t old - humor me for a minute.) I can be content, though, in knowing that the God who designs and upholds the days, seasons, and years has designed them for me, and me for them. And I can enjoy living them and passing the lessons of life on to my little girls. God is good.</p>

			 <p>Last night I was headed to bed at a relatively early hour, and as I prepared to go to sleep I decided I&rsquo;d get up and run this morning. I haven&rsquo;t run much lately, and I need to. This morning was going to be relatively warm, good for running.</p>
<p>Then the Bears staged an amazing comeback and won the football game. I <em>had</em> to keep watching. The game ended at 11 PM, I figured I&rsquo;d still be OK.</p>
<p>Then Laura woke up at 3 AM. And again at 4:30 AM. She pitched a fit when I told her she had to go back to sleep. I left her in her crib. At 5:00 she was back awake. So I brought her into our bed. She was awake until 5:30 when I finally got up to get ready for work. By 6:20 when I was leaving the house she was finally sleeping. Hopefully she sleeps in a while.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t get any running done this morning. And I think I&rsquo;ll be finding something to drink with caffine in it here very soon now.</p>
<p>Children are an amazing blessing. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t keep you up at night one way or another. :-)</p>

			 <p>I got out for a run yesterday afternoon - probably the first time in 2 weeks that I&rsquo;ve run. It feels good to be a little bit sore this morning. It&rsquo;s going to be hard to get too motivated to run these next few days - it&rsquo;s gonna be cold and windy. But we just got a membership to the MAC (a local gym) so I&rsquo;ll be using it instead.</p>
<p>Within the next month they should have the satellite MAC complete and open; it&rsquo;s going to be only about a mile from home. And my good friend and former associate pastor John Wilbur will be co-managing it. Excellent. They are also bragging about individual 19&quot; LCD TVs on <em>every treadmill and elliptical</em>. Almost sounds like overkill&hellip; almost.</p>
<p>I guess my 5K race running is done for the fall; the only ones remaining around here are on Sunday mornings. Grrrr. I&rsquo;ll have to keep busy on the treadmills over the winter and then I&rsquo;ll be ready for some spring races. I could get into this running stuff.</p>

			 <p>So yesterday after church <a href="/06/10/music-for-your-sunday/">I posted a recording of Andrew and me</a> singing a song in church.</p>
<p>Talking to Andrew later in the afternoon, apparently shortly after lunch he gets a call from his girlfriend in Portland. She says &ldquo;hi, how ya doin, have you heard this song before?&rdquo; And then he recognizes the song she&rsquo;s playing him&hellip; yep, it&rsquo;s that song we did just hours before. He was dumbfounded. &ldquo;We just sang that song in church this morning,&rdquo; he spluttered. Then he realized. I had already posted it on my blog, she had already read it, and she was calling to let him know. Too cool.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://www.feedlounge.com">FeedLounge</a> for several months now (ever since they came out of beta!) as my online feed reader. It has, without a doubt, the nicest UI (user interface, for my non-geek readers) of any feed reader, online or off, that I&rsquo;ve ever come across. At the time I signed up, none of the other online feed readers were much good; Bloglines was the best of the bunch, but still not great. So I ponied up my $5/month and felt like it was an OK deal.</p>
<p>The convergence fo a few events have caused my thinking to change in the past week. First, I ran across the new and improved Google Reader. And boy, is it improved. There are still a few little things I wish it had (like choosing your sort order - I like to read from oldest to newest), but for the most part, it does everything I want a feed reader to do. Second, FeedLounge has been through a couple of frustrating hiccups this week, two separate issues causing multi-hour downtimes. Third, I&rsquo;d like to save the $5/month. So, I dumped my OPML file from FeedLounge, imported it into Google Reader, and I&rsquo;m good to go. I cancelled my FeedLounge subscription this morning.</p>
<p>Now I know <a href="http://www.ijsm.org">Geof</a> will have some comment to post here; he&rsquo;s been using FeedLounge since the very beginning, maybe even before that; heck, he even had a version of it named in his honor! And I can&rsquo;t fault him for sticking with it; it&rsquo;s a great product. But market forces really do work; given the choice of a lower-priced, similar-and-acceptable functionality product, I&rsquo;ll make the switch.</p>

A brief quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as your comments regarding me, I welcome them but must confess that maybe telling me them before they get sent out to cyber world like fresh meat to feed all my critics would be preferable. Either way, I love, respect, and appreciate you very much and have an open ear for any counsel or criticism from you. Perhaps some day I can take a few minutes to tell you my life story as it may help to explain a bit of who I am and make our friendship even simpler. It was a tremendous honor to be in the company of men I have learned much from over the years and made the celebration of 10 years in ministry all the more memorable. This past weekend was one of the highlights of my life. So, thank you very much and I pray you get some rest after the conference.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am sad that this is the moment that most sticks in my mind from the Desiring God 2006 National Conference, but it&rsquo;s still rankling me, so I&rsquo;ll post about it here and see if it generates any discussion.</p>
<p><a href="http://joshharrisblogson.blogspot.com">Josh Harris</a> has posted the best <a href="http://joshharrisblogson.blogspot.com/2006/10/desiring-god-2006-day-two.html">summary of Piper&rsquo;s comments</a> thus far. Note that all this was said <em>after</em> Driscoll had left to catch his flight back to Seattle. Josh narrates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piper began by explaining how he thinks about who he hangs out with and how he decides who to invite to speak. “I have a litmus paper and its called theology,” he said. He referenced a point Driscoll had made in his talk about the importance of holding certain unchanging truths in our left hand that are the non-negotiables of the faith, while being willing to contextualize and differ on secondary issues and stylistically (these are “right hand” issues). Driscoll had listed nine issues we need to contend for, including the authority of God’s word, the sovereignty of God, Penal Substitutionary Atonement, the exclusivity of Christ, and gender roles, to name a few.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So Piper said, “If he [Driscoll] has those nine things in his left hand, I’m not even going to look at his right hand.” The audience clapped loudly for this. Then Piper went on to share that he does have some differences with Driscoll on some so-called “right hand” issues of style, which he feels free to share with Driscoll. He went on to share a specific one, noting that Driscoll would get to see this on video. (This was the moment I was glad I wasn’t Mark!)<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
As if he were speaking to Mark, he said (and I paraphrase), “A pastor cannot be clever and show Christ as glorious. Mark Driscoll, you’re clever. You have an amazing ability to turn a phrase and make statements that draw people back week after week. But it’s dangerous. So many pastors will see you and try to imitate you and then try to watch all the movies and TV shows so they can try to be like you.” In essence, Piper was bringing correction to certain aspects of Driscoll’s style and delivery, while stating that they agreed on the most important issues of doctrine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Josh is very charitable in his evaluation of these remarks: &ldquo;I felt in his statement not just a correction for Driscoll, but for me and every other young preacher learning to proclaim the good news of the glorious savior. Thank God we get to learn from guys like Piper. Thank God they’re talking to us. I’d rather be corrected by John Piper than cooed over by someone else.&rdquo; But they rubbed me the wrong way. And yes, I&rsquo;m aware of the irony of posting critical comments about someone&rsquo;s critical comments.</p>
<p>Two things. First of all, Piper contradicts himself. First he says that as long as the doctrine is sound, I&rsquo;m not going to look at the &ldquo;right hand&rdquo;. But then he goes on to look at, evaluate, and rebuke the right hand. Decide which it is, brother.</p>
<p>Second, I think Piper should&rsquo;ve stopped after the first part of the statement. Affirm the guy, say you&rsquo;ll stand with him if he&rsquo;s right on doctrine, then stop. If Piper felt a public rebuke was necessary, he should&rsquo;ve done it in the context of a discussion where Driscoll was present and able to respond. But to rebuke Driscoll after he had left, and on matters of style, not of content, to me seems to have been the wrong move. It only served to highlight the discomfortable divide that still remains between the &ldquo;old guard&rdquo; and Driscoll. And as Piper himself said in the first part of the statement, we need to contend for doctrine, and then let the other stuff go. I think he should have followed his own advice.</p>

			 <p>I got home about 2:30 this morning from two days in Minneapolis at the <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Events/NationalConferences/Archives/2006/">Desiring God 06 National Conference</a>. Richard and I got up there Friday afternoon, and after a tasty dinner at <a href="http://www.britspub.com/index.php">Brit&rsquo;s Pub</a>, we perused the massive book sale before heading in for session one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just thumbnail the conference in this post, then if I&rsquo;m motivated I may post more in depth in future posts. If you want to get a good summary of the conference speakers, go to <a href="http://www.challies.com">challies.com</a>. Amazing how much info he&rsquo;s got on there.</p>
<p>The opening night speaker was David Wells; he&rsquo;s a professor at a seminary in Massachussets, a charming older British gent who spoke on <em>The Supremacy of Christ in a Postmodern World</em>. Good stuff.</p>
<p>After the opening session I walked 8 blocks or so over to Block E to meet several folks from the <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/">dot net</a>. It was fun to get to meet these people face to face; Erik and Rhea, Mike and Rachel (and little 3-week old Emma), Rae and Amy, and Jamie.</p>
<p>Saturday morning brought a continued quality slate of speakers: Voddie Baucham, Tim Keller, Mark Driscoll, and Don Carson. They were very good, excellent, best of the conference, and somewhat academic, but still thoughtful, respectively.</p>
<p>We took off right after Don Carson spoke in the evening and high-tailed it back to Iowa. Richard still had to be at church for Sunday morning; I got my brother Andrew to lead music for me so I could sleep in. Thanks bub!</p>

			 <p>I made this announcement after both services at Noelridge today. I didn&rsquo;t read from a script, so this isn&rsquo;t verbatim, but is the gist of the message I had for the folks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After much prayer, thought, and discussion, I have come to the decision that the best thing for me and my family right now is that I step back from my role as the worship leader here at Noelridge. Now, that&rsquo;s not a fun announcement to make, but let me explain a little bit.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The key factor playing into this decision is time. This hit home the most to me when I recently realized that my current life schedule of work and ministry is the same or busier than it was seven years ago when we moved to Cedar Rapids. However, in those seven years God has blessed us with two little girls. And while Becky&rsquo;s schedule has changed drastically since the girls were born, my schedule hasn&rsquo;t changed at all. And it needs to.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I also want the time to be able to get involved in community things. My entire social life and structure has been within the church, and that&rsquo;s not good. I need to have the time and freedom to be able to be involved in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, to reach out to my community. You have also entrusted me with a role as an elder here at Noelridge, and I want to make sure I have the time to do that well.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Let me emphasize that we are not going anywhere. Noelridge has been a great blessing as our home church for seven years now, and our desire is very much to stay here, I will just be in a different role. Sunday mornings will look at bit different; we have many other talented musicians in the church here who are capable of helping with music, and we will be calling on them. Worship team may also look different for a while, we&rsquo;re still having discussions on that.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So thank you for letting me lead these past years, and for understanding as I move to fulfill responsibilities in a new season of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a big relief to get this off my chest and officially announced. I&rsquo;m looking forward to see how God will use the folks in the church to fill in and minister in different ways.</p>

			 <p>Last Saturday I ran in my first-ever 5K, the Solon High School Spartan Fund Run. They had a few hundred folks show up, many to do the half-mile and mile walks, another 83 for the 5K, and mabe a few dozen for a 10K. My sister Rebecca had agreed to run it with me, so we got up early and headed down on the 30-minute drive to Solon.</p>
<p>The race was done well; the organization was good, the t-shirt design was pretty decent, and they had procured a bunch of donated food which was good as a late breakfast after the run.</p>
<p>The one thing this 5K had that I hadn&rsquo;t trained for was <em>hills</em>! I didn&rsquo;t realize how flat my neighborhood course is until I got out there and had long uphill climbs at both the beginning and end of the race. And the last half-mile not only did you have to go uphill, but you were running directly into a 15 mph wind. But, we toughed it out. There were 83 competitors in the 5K, and I came in 53rd in a time of 31:12. Rebecca came in 69th in about 35:00. (Reba, leave your exact time in a comment and I&rsquo;ll fix it here.) I didn&rsquo;t get under 30, which had been my goal, but at least it was a good test.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve got the bug; I&rsquo;m looking for another race around here yet before the season is over. The one that&rsquo;s reasonably close and on a day I could make it isn&rsquo;t a 5K, though - it&rsquo;s a 5-<em>mile</em>. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be ready for that by November 12 or not.</p>

			 <p>Last night I took the opportunity to visit <a href="http://cafe.recminusa.org">Conversation Cafe</a>, a discussion group at <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">a local coffeehouse</a> that is led by my pastor. The guest speaker for the night was Rick, the minister from the local Unitarian Universalist (UU) church. It was, to say the least, an interesting night.</p>
<p>Rick is an older single man who has a fascinating life story. He has at various times in his life been a New York City taxicab driver, a journalist, a lawyer, and a teacher, in addition to being a minister for the past 15 years. He shared some of his beliefs and perspectives on spirituality, and it was quite a grab bag. He is an agnostic, but chooses to believe that God exists. He is happy with belief in things that he can see, feel, touch, and quantify, but is really unwilling to make truth judgements outside of that experience.</p>
<p>Rick told us that UUs are &ldquo;sin shy&rdquo;; they would acknowledge that there is some human behavior that just seems &ldquo;evil&rdquo; and that we can&rsquo;t explain any other way, but that for most human actions that seem to be &ldquo;sin&rdquo; there is some other more useful explanation for their behavior, be it conditioning, circumstance, or something similar. He told us that the UU church has no creed, which is &ldquo;actually harder than having a creed&rdquo;, because you have to figure things out for yourself. Each person at that church can define God to be whatever they want God to be.</p>
<p>There was a decent bit of discussion throughout the night, but I felt like on the key questions he either didn&rsquo;t understand quite what we were asking, or was quite skilled at dodging them. I tried to ask about one major conflict I saw in his thinking; maybe I didn&rsquo;t phrase the question well. But I was trying to ask this: in one breath you say that God is whatever you make him to be, that your observations and reason are the definers of truth and reality for you. But in the next breath you admit that you are human, with a finite understanding, uncertainty, and weakness. Isn&rsquo;t there a conflict there? Doesn&rsquo;t that make your &ldquo;truth&rdquo; weak and uncertain? Doesn&rsquo;t that make God weak and uncertain? I&rsquo;m not sure he really understood the question; basically he just agreed that yes, he is human, and uncertainty is part of the human condition.</p>
<p>My heart breaks for this man who is so close to understanding some things, but still so far away. He spoke very candidly about having, in years past, a drinking problem. And it frustrated him greatly, because he saw it as a &ldquo;moral failure&rdquo;, and couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to get past it. Thinking of it as a moral failure &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t useful&rdquo; and &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t take you anywhere&rdquo;. So he associated with some folks who encouraged him to see the drinking problem as a sickness rather than a moral failure, and he decided to accept that &ldquo;truth&rdquo; since it was useful, and allowed him a path to move on. Rick is so close; if only his eyes were opened to see that he is right, that sin (aka &ldquo;moral failure&rdquo;) <em>is</em> a dead end, and that we as humans are stuck. If only he could understand that the reason Jesus came, died, and rose again was to solve that sin problem. My prayer for Rick will be that he can come to faith in a God larger than his understanding, and know the grace that is greater than all our sins.</p>

			 <p>This weekend wasn&rsquo;t too busy, but I wasn&rsquo;t on the computer, so no blog updates.</p>
<p>Rebecca and I ran in the Solon Fund Run 5K on Saturday and did OK. I didn&rsquo;t hit my goal of sub-30-minutes; I finished in 31:12. I&rsquo;ll blame it on a 10 mph headwind and a long uphill the last half mile. Still, it was a lot of fun, and I&rsquo;m looking for another race to sign up for yet this fall. I&rsquo;ll do a full post with pictures when I get the chance.</p>
<p>Watched a bunch of football over the weekend, the Hawkeyes won, setting up a bit showdown with Ohio State in a couple of weeks, but the Huskers couldn&rsquo;t score the upset over USC. Not that I expected them too, but it would&rsquo;ve been cool.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday and back-to-work. I&rsquo;m going to start working on some new stuff, though, so that should be interesting. Gotta brush up on my C++ coding skills - haven&rsquo;t used them since school!</p>
<p>Oh, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to next weekend - I&rsquo;ll be heading up to Minneapolis along with Pastor Richard to the <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/Events/NationalConferences/Archives/2006/">Desiring God 2006 National Conference</a>. The list of speakers:</p>

			 <p>Well, my last training run before the Solon 5K on Saturday. I woke up before my alarm this morning (no small feat when the alarm is set for 5:10 am!) and headed out on my usual 3.2 mile course. It was a beautiful early morning, chilly and brisk, the sky bright, clear, and full of stars.</p>
<p>For not having run much the past two weeks, my times were ok:</p>
<p>Mile 1: 7:38. A nice brisk pace. Mile 2: 9:59 (total: 17:37). Slowed a bit here, was starting to feel it by about the last 1/4 mile. Mile 3: 10:38 (total: 28:16). That long hill the last quarter mile gets me every time. Total time: 30:39. Didn&rsquo;t quite get in under 30:00. :-(</p>
<p>My goal for the 5k on Saturday is to get in under 30:00. Should be a fun test.</p>

			 <p>I told myself that I should run a good three times this week in preparation for the Solon 5K on Saturday. After all, I didn&rsquo;t get much running in last week while we were on vacation. I was good on Monday, ran 2 miles, felt decent. I intended to run again this morning, but after not getting to sleep until around midnight, 5 AM for running was just too early. Maybe this afternoon or tonight. I&rsquo;m thinking today, maybe tomorrow, and then take Friday off to rest. We&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&rsquo;s been a fairly uneventful week thus far. Monday night we were home - first Monday night home since softball started back in May! Last night Becky did supper with some friends from church, so I had a night at home with the girls. Then last night I screwed up the Master Boot Record on my basement PC, so I spent the remainder of the night trying to get it wiped and re-loaded. I think it&rsquo;s pretty well wiped now, so hopefully the Sony Recovery disks can do the rest of the work for me.</p>

<p>Sunday night&rsquo;s concert went well; we played about 80 minutes of music and, from what I am told, it sounded quite good. The recording we made wasn&rsquo;t so good; we don&rsquo;t have a compressor in the system and the signal was so strong that many of the songs we just overloaded the recorder.

(Good for them!) So as their amateur replacements, the Hubbs brothers will be providing the musical entertainment this year.</p>

<p>I only have a couple of more tasks in preparation: I need to try to drum up an electric piano we can use for the night (I know who to call, I just have to make the call) and I need to practice. I need to practice a lot.</p>

			 <p>I may be reasonably intelligent, but sometimes I miss the obvious. I have known since we bought our house that there is tubing running from the furnace across the floor and under a wall into a drain below the bathroom sink, but it never dawned on me why it was there.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning it became clear. I went downstairs for a shower and found the bath mat sopping wet. And more water standing on the floor. My initial reaction was to think that the sewer pipe had gotten clogged again; I&rsquo;ve had to snake it out twice in the last 3 years. But no, my mother-in-law wasn&rsquo;t here, so that couldn&rsquo;t be it. I cleaned up the water as best I could and then headed to work, but not before mentioning it to Becky who was up early with Addison.</p>
<p>Becky investigated further and found that the water was coming from that drain line. And that drain line carries the condensation that builds up on the air conditioner coils which are inside the blower there in the furnace. It ended up that the drain line had gotten totally clogged up, and finally the water had started leaking. So she turned off the air conditioner, cleaned up the rest of the mess, read up on the topic on the internet, and then called me to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>My initial reaction was to say &ldquo;hey, let&rsquo;s just stick a bucket under it and empty the bucket occasionally.&rdquo; Then she told me that according to the internet the a/c can produce 5 - 9 <em>gallons</em> of water a day. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. So the bucket idea was out. We ended up hitting Lowe&rsquo;s (so nice to have a Lowe&rsquo;s only 3 blocks from our house!) on the way to WT practice last night and picking up some new tubing and a few screw-on connectors so I can have a way, outside of cutting the tubing, to clean it out again if the need arises.</p>
<p>The other complication was that the previous owner of the house built a nice little wall around 2 sides of the furnace to hide it from sight and make a nice little hallway. Unfortunately, the drain pipe was on the back side of the furnace, towards the wall. So I spent a bunch of my repair time last night with my upper body shoved through a 15&quot; x 18&quot; hole I cut in the drywall. It probably would&rsquo;ve made a funny picture, but thankfully Becky left the camera upstairs. I&rsquo;ll put up a cabinet door or something over the hole so I can get to it next time if I need to.</p>
<p>By 9:30 last night I had it all fixed and the mess mostly cleaned up. I checked it this morning and the line was still draining nicely. All in all it only required a few hours of sweat and about ten bucks worth of parts. Not too awful, as home repairs go.</p>
<p>Oh, and I watched the water drain after I turned the a/c on last night. Five gallons per day is an understatement.</p>

			 <p>Or at least what counts for wacky in my world. I realize my life is pretty calm compared to some of the rest of you.</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran 2 miles this morning. And actually ran the whole thing, didn&rsquo;t walk <em>at all</em>. My time was 19:14, which isn&rsquo;t awesome, but is tolerable. I&rsquo;ll shoot for the 5k distance again tomorrow.</li>
<li>I witnessed something last night at our church softball game (the last one of the season :-() which I had never witnessed before: the two umpires getting into a shouting match with each other. In our league, each team volunteers a player to ump the game before (or after) their own game. It&rsquo;s usually very low-key. But the field ump made a call last night and the plate ump over-ruled him, and they got into it. Then towards the end of the game the plate ump ended the game and walked off the field, when the rule clearly states that we could&rsquo;ve started the 7th inning. Grrrr&hellip; but it was a good game, we played well and won.</li>
<li>Evening shows like <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/08/21/its-hip-to-be-square/">this one</a> make me wish I lived close to Nashville. The closest any of the <a href="http://squarepegalliance.com">Square Pegs</a> will be getting to Iowa this year is when <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andy P</a> plays in Omaha and Lincoln, NE. Not close enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I guess most of that wasn&rsquo;t wacky. But it was stuff, though, you can&rsquo;t deny it was stuff. One outta two isn&rsquo;t bad.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s something about sunsets that make me nostalgic. I&rsquo;m not sure what it is about them, but give me the chance to look to the horizon as the last light of the day streaks across the landscape, and I&rsquo;m entranced.</p>
<p>One specific sunset comes to mind&hellip; Open one of the photo albums at my parents' house and you will find some pictures that date from the summer of 1990. It was a tumultuous year for us. Dad had to head to Colorado to work for two weeks, which was an eternity for him to be gone. Later on that summer his job situation would cause us to move from Nebraska to Texas. I was 13, had just finished seventh grade.</p>
<p>Several times during that two weeks that Dad was in Colorado Mom would take us out to the state park outside of town. As I see it now, she was probably just trying to keep her sanity after dealing with five kids in the house all day. But we&rsquo;d go to the lake in the evening, fish, swim, and just hang out until the sun went down and it was time to go home and to bed.</p>
<p>One of those nights Mom brought the camera along. I don&rsquo;t remember the night exactly, but the pictures she took capture the sunset-streaked moments of me and my siblings on the beach, playing in the sand and the water. There is one particularly memorable photo of my brother Aaron, the little awnry scamp, with a bucket of water cocked and ready to fling right at the camera. (The actual existence of the photo probably indicates he didn&rsquo;t actually fling it in that direction at that moment.) Every time I look at those photos, the emotions kick in. Something about the sunset signifying an end, the end of my childhood years, of that season of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the first person to notice that seasons change. Read Ecclesiastes sometime. There is a time for everything. Sunsets may have tinges of sadness to them - but without a sunset, there&rsquo;s no chance for the sun to rise again. I don&rsquo;t know when my life&rsquo;s next &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; will come, but those pictures remind me that even as seasons change, we have hope for a new day coming.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m going to make a real effort to do a bunch of running this week. I&rsquo;ve been too much of a slacker; I need to crank it up. I ran 5K this morning, it was nice and dark and cool. I made it *almost* 2 miles before I had to walk&hellip; I was rather disgusted with myself then that I did walk for 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>Mile 1: 8:18<br>
Mile 2: 9:47 (total: 18:05)<br>
Mile 3: 10:43 (total 28:48)<br>
End: 31:10</p>
<p>The Solon 5K is less than three weeks away&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Back in Texas, Sonic was a favorite fast food place of ours. Who can top the Route 44 Cherry Limeade? When we moved to Iowa, we had to kick the habit; there&rsquo;s only one Sonic in Iowa, and it&rsquo;s two hours away in Des Moines.</p>
<p>But then we found out a couple of months ago that there are plans to build several Sonics in our area.</p>
<p>Then even better, we found out this morning that they&rsquo;re building the first one, to open around December 1, <em>only four blocks from our house.</em></p>
<p>I sense some cherry limeades in my future. :-)</p>

			 <p><strong>Odd</strong>: 13, the number of runs we had last night in our softball game. Also the number of runs our opponents had. After 7 innings it was just too dark to continue to play (8:30 pm or so), so we called it a draw. It was a beautiful night, and a fun game.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong>: The end of the run yesterday was about 2 miles from where I started it. Enough, at least, to get my blood pumping. I did the first mile without walking at all. Woohoo!</p>
<p><strong>Odd</strong>: 15, the day of the month today. Which means that it&rsquo;s my brother Ryan&rsquo;s birthday today!</p>

			 <p>It hasn&rsquo;t been a real productive week for me as far as running goes; three mornings this week we we had rain come through between 5 and 7 am, which is my usual running time. I did get 2.5 miles in on Tuesday, but that was it.</p>
<p>So today, after cleaning out the gutters and mowing the lawn, it was time to go run again. The Solon 5K is only a month away&hellip; My times for this run:</p>
<p>Mile 1: 8:02<br>
Mile 2: 18:50<br>
Mile 3: 29:57<br>
End : 32:43</p>
<p>I came in a couple of minutes quicker than <a href="/06/08/my-first-training-run/">last week&rsquo;s run</a>; my first mile was actually a couple of minutes <em>slower</em> this week, but I had a more consistent time for miles 2 and 3 this week.</p>
<p>Only a month to go before the big race. Hopefully I can find time to run more than once a week before then. :-)</p>

			 <p>I was reading back through some of my old blog posts this morning, tagging them appropriately, (100 down, 300 still to go&hellip;) when I found <a href="/06/04/a-time-of-refreshing/">this post</a> that I&rsquo;d written back in April about burning out and refreshing. In that post I talk about getting burned out with worship team, and how nice it was to get at least one week a month off.</p>
<p>That was in April. That week that I had off in April was the last Sunday that I&rsquo;ve had off since then. Basically, for 4 months. My usual substitute leaders and musicians have been gone on vacations and with family issues and illnesses, and the end result is that when you&rsquo;re the leader, you&rsquo;re stuck with it if nobody else is available. And I feel like I&rsquo;m starting to fray around the edges.</p>
<p>Now, I know that there are people from my congregation who will read this. Let me assure you all, I love leading the music. But there is a point at which some things have to come into balance. I have a full-time job outside the church that will entail more travel over the upcoming months and the potential for overtime hours. I have a wife and two young daughters at home who need to have me around. I have (or will soon have) an elder/deacon list of folks who I am responsible for as their elder. Then there&rsquo;s the whole realm of responsibilities to myself, like taking the time to exercise regularly to stay healthy, and taking enough time in recreation (and think of it with a hyphen: &ldquo;re-creation&rdquo;) to stay sane. When the commitments of worship team are added in, too, it&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>So basically, I&rsquo;m back to the &ldquo;something&rsquo;s gotta give&rdquo; spot that I was in back at Christmas. I should apologize to my wife right now. She has noted in the past how I manage to get things better for a while, but then everything creeps back in and I&rsquo;m busier than before. I&rsquo;m there again. It&rsquo;s creeped back in. And now I have more work stuff on top of it. I&rsquo;m sorry, Becky, I&rsquo;ve let it happen again.</p>
<p>I know what my pastor&rsquo;s reaction will be to this when I talk to him: he&rsquo;ll say that I should make the effort to get other leaders lined up so I don&rsquo;t have to do it all the time. And he&rsquo;ll be right, of course. What I need his help with is in urging others to be available to lead to give me time off. There are at least half a dozen men at church fully capable of filling the pulpit when Richard is gone. Lord, where are the musicians?</p>
<p>I have at least a little enforced vacation coming up - the weekend after labor day we&rsquo;re leaving the kiddos with my parents and going to Wisconsin Dells for a couple of days. And I <em>will</em> be gone on that Sunday. My brother Andrew is in town for the fall, so he will be able to provide some relief, I think, provided that I can get him trained up in all the surrounding tasks. (He can do the music just fine, it&rsquo;s just the administrative details he will need to learn.) But he probably won&rsquo;t be around past Christmas. I need to find a longer-term fix than that.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve gone and spilled my guts on the blog again. Now I need to do something in the real world to make it happen. What do I do to break this cycle? I can&rsquo;t afford to do this every year. Seriously, folks, if you have suggestions or thoughts, I want to hear them. Thanks.</p>

			 <p>A trusty IT guy came by this morning to deliver a new Dell 19&quot; LCD monitor. He was also good enough to haul away the old 21&quot; CRT behemoth. Amazing how my 19&quot; CRT now looks fuzzy and crappy in comparison.</p>
<p>The one downside is that the resolution of the LCD is only 1280 x 1024, and I&rsquo;m more used to running 1600 x 1200. But I&rsquo;ll adjust some font sizes and then get used to it. Well worth it to have the new monitor. And I can see some of my desk again!</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I was sitting at my desk working away when suddenly, bzzt! and one of my monitors went dark. I have been using two monitors for the past couple of years; I have two CRTs on my desk; one 21&quot; behemoth and one 19&quot; behemoth&rsquo;s-younger-brother. My desk panel that they sit on is bowed down in the middle by about an inch because of the weight. I&rsquo;ve been wishing for LCD monitors for a while (hey, the new folks have them!) but the company&rsquo;s policy is that we&rsquo;ll only replace them when they die.</p>
<p>So yesterday my 21&quot; HP monitor died. It had been showing symptons for a month or so now, so I&rsquo;m not too suprised. I have a new 19&quot; LCD monitor on order; hopefully it&rsquo;ll get delivered yet this afternoon; if not, definitely tomorrow. Then I can go back to working in wide-screen happiness. As it is right now, I&rsquo;m limited to 1600 x 1200 resolution, and I&rsquo;m feeling a bit squeezed.</p>

			 <p>The title is just a warning that some of your eyes might glaze over whilst reading this post. Others of you will find it interesting. Still others of you might have good advice to offer me&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyhow, I needed a good geek project to work on this weekend, I wanted to try something new. So I have this old PC sitting downstairs that I&rsquo;m not using for anything except as a backup for the laptop and for doing filesharing (gotta love <a href="http://www.indieriver.net">indieriver.net</a>!), and it&rsquo;s bogged down with lots of stuff; I&rsquo;ve had it for 5 or 6 years now and never wiped it or reloaded it. So, I decided to have some fun and try doing a Linux installation. I actually settled on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, which appears to have a fairly decent desktop interface and a nicely-designed installation.</p>
<p>Installing Ubuntu was actually very easy. I backed up the little data I wanted to save onto the laptop, then went ahead and repartitioned the 60 GB hard drive. The installation went quickly, and I was up and running. Getting a driver to work for my D-Link DWL-G122 USB Wifi adapter was a bit more of a challenge. But I got it working Saturday night after some serious consultation of the Ubuntu help forums.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;m stuck with two things right now. 1) I have a printer attached to the Linux machine, and it works fine. However, I need to get it shared with the laptop. I almost had it last night, but no such luck. There&rsquo;s some combination of Samba and CUPS settings that I haven&rsquo;t hit on yet that should do the trick. 2) I need to get a file sharing program running. The obvious choice is Azureus. However, it&rsquo;s running into Java errors and hanging up on me; I end up having to <strong>kill -9</strong> it every time. I did a brief web search for other torrent programs that might be good, but haven&rsquo;t found anything I&rsquo;m very happy with yet. I used <a href="http://www.utorrent.com">Utorrent</a> when I was using Windows, and like it a lot. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no Linux version available.</p>
<p>Any suggestions from anybody for a torrent program? Should I just try debugging the Java issues in Azureus? Since that&rsquo;s the primary function of that PC, it&rsquo;d be nice to have it working. And I can&rsquo;t afford to spend too many more nights up past 10 pm working on it. It makes it really hard to get up in the morning and run.</p>

			 <p>I have a 5K course mapped out through our neighborhood, so I gave it my first try at that distance on Friday. It was early afternoon, probably 85 degrees out. Here were my split times:</p>
<p>Mile 1: 7:43<br>
Mile 2: 18:56<br>
Mile 3: 31:38<br>
End: 34:20</p>
<p>I was cranking it out the first mile, didn&rsquo;t have to walk much at all. Actually, through the whole thing, it wasn&rsquo;t the cardio part that was slowing me down - it was my legs. My calves were cramping up pretty bad. The second mile I walked more; obviously, I went from an 8-minute mile to an 11-minute second mile. The third mile was then about 12 minutes. There is a nice long uphill grade to finish the third mile, it&rsquo;s a good test.</p>
<p>All in all, 34 minutes isn&rsquo;t too awful for my first try. I need to keep at this, though, so I can be better prepared for the 5K on September 16th.</p>

			 <p>Got home from Seattle about midnight last night. Oh so much fun. Our plane was late leaving Seattle, but fortunately we had a good tail wind or we never would&rsquo;ve made the connection in Minneapolis. As it was, could our gates have been further apart? Not really. We landed at F8 and had to get to A6. I think we were the last two on the plane. But we got home. Oh, and I got to fly first class from Seattle to MSP. That was nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hitting work for long enough to catch up a bit and file my expense report, then I&rsquo;m going home to see Becky and the girls. On a totally unrelated note, if I have time to crash this weekend, I&rsquo;m thinking of converting my old PC down in the basement to run some *nix flavor instead of Windows&hellip; Ubuntu is looking like the early favorite. Should be a fun task.</p>

			 <p>This weekend I signed up for a 5K run. I&rsquo;ve never done something like this before. I&rsquo;ve not been a big runner in past years, but with 30 approaching and too many pounds around my waistline, it is time to get more serious about it. I have increased motivation to run; finding time is still the difficulty.</p>
<p>Inspired in a good part by <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/">Jeff</a> and <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/adriene/">Adriene</a>&rsquo;s efforts, I sent in my registration Saturday to run in a 5K in Solon on September 16th. In a fit of insanity, my sister <a href="http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/">Rebecca</a> agreed to run it with me. She&rsquo;ll probably beat me, too. So now I have seven weeks to try to get ready for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really scared of the distance; when I get out and run now I do 2.5 - 3 miles in about 30 minutes. I still end up having to interspurse some walking amidst the jogging. I just need to push my endurance up so I can walk less and jog more.</p>
<p>An aside here: I found a really cool website that has been helpful: <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com">mapmyrun.com</a>. It uses the Google Maps API to allow you to chart a run (even going cross-country if you want to!). It&rsquo;ll then show you the mileage of that run, and, given the time it took you to run it and your age, height, and weight, will even calculate a calorie burn. Maps can be saved and shared. Pretty cool. You can see <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/view_run.php?r=ad60e0d0f03c58baccf2759d918cbbbf">my little 5K training map</a> if you want to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be tough to train any this week, seeing as I have a full day today and then I&rsquo;m headed to Seattle tomorrow morning early. Maybe once I get back and it&rsquo;s a bit cooler I can start cranking out the miles. I&rsquo;ve gotta try&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was Laura&rsquo;s second birthday. So, we invited a bunch of friends over to celebrate. Actually, this was her second birthday party this year; we had one with my family on Saturday, and now one with friends. Two years old, two parties. Don&rsquo;t get any ideas about next year, kiddo!</p>
<p>So the Scotts, the Finleys, the Wilburs, the Garner women (freshly-minted First Officer Daniel was supposed to get home last night sometime after being gone for six weeks!) and my brother and sister came over. It was waaay to warm and humid in the backyard, but we sweltered through it and munched on hot dogs, salads, fruit, and the requsite cake and ice cream. Laura opened a few presents and then there were gift bags for all the kiddos that were a big hit. I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that a good time was had by all.</p>
<p>We took a bunch of pictures, but I didn&rsquo;t get them off the camera last night. I&rsquo;ll try to remember to add them to this post when I get a chance. I still can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s two already&hellip;</p>

			 <p>She&rsquo;s too young to read this, but still, I can&rsquo;t believe that my little girl turns 2 today! It seems like just yesterday we were bringing her home from the hospital, and now she&rsquo;s a little fireball, talking a blue streak, playing with her little sister, and enjoying her new fishies. Scary to think that it only speeds up from here&hellip;</p>

			 <p>For those of you brave enough to read past the title, congratulations! Now instead of me talking about music by people my age, you get to hear me talk about music written by dead people. Well, they weren&rsquo;t dead when they wrote it&hellip; but let&rsquo;s not confuse the issue.</p>
<p>I grew up listening to lots of classical music. This was pretty much due to the fact that my parents listened to lots of classical music, and I was too young to buy records or run the record player. So classical it was. I remember Bach Cello suites, including a neat recording played by John Williams or Segovia or somebody on the guitar. Dad liked Stravinsky, so we heard some of that, too. And then there was the requisite Beethoven, and then some fun stuff by Prokofiev. (Though the title &ldquo;<em>Love for Three Oranges</em>&rdquo; sounds kinda kinky now that I think about it&hellip;)</p>
<p>Then I started taking piano lessons, and gained some more personal appreciation for composers. I think I initially got started playing Grieg because my friend Lydia was playing him, and I wanted to out-do her. However, he quickly became a favorite. Then I got my skill up to where I could tackle Chopin&rsquo;s <em>Ballades</em>. They&rsquo;re still some of my favorites. (How do I pick between No. 1 in G-Minor and No. 4 in F minor? Too tough to call!) And then there was Rachmaninoff. I hacked through his <em>Second Piano Concerto</em> during my first couple of years of high school. It was only after college that I picked up some of his <em>Preludes</em>, <em>Etudes Tableux</em>, and his wonderful arrangement of Kreisler&rsquo;s <em>Liebesfreud</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, and any talk about my classical music history wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without mentioning that tape of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <em>1812 Overture</em> and <em>Capriccio Italien</em> that got played over and over and over and over in the van.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have classical music on that much any more; I&rsquo;m going to have to make sure that I turn it on more often so Laura and Addison grow up with at least an exposure to it. Laura, though, already watches a Classical Baby DVD that has a bunch of good stuff on it; Mozart, Bach, Schumann, Bartok, and Villa Lobos, to name just a few. I guess that&rsquo;s a good start. Next I&rsquo;ll pull out some Mussorgsky&hellip;</p>

			 <p>It was busy busy busy, but it was fun. My brother Andrew is now officially a resident of Cedar Rapids. He&rsquo;ll be down here at least for the fall, working at Menards and taking a couple of classes at Kirkwood. So he was/is in town.</p>
<p>Mom. Dad, and Aaron came down from Wisconsin to celebrate Laura&rsquo;s birthday. It&rsquo;s so hard to believe that my little girl is turning 2 years old this week! We had a fun time with them. Sunday our church had our usual service and picnic in the park. It&rsquo;s a bit taxing for me, since it means I have to cart out all the sound gear, but it was special this year since Andrew and Aaron led music with me. They both played guitars, and I played bass. I think it went really well.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that Laura&rsquo;s birthday is coming up? Becky and I decided to get her an aquarium this year. She just loves fish, and is glued to any fish tank she sees. So we are now the proud owners of a ten-gallon aquarium. Once we give the water another day to stabilize, we&rsquo;ll become the proud owners of a few little fish to go in the aquarium. Hopefully she&rsquo;ll enjoy it - I think I will, too.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s the news from Lake Wobegon Hiawatha for the weekend. It&rsquo;s now Monday and I&rsquo;m back at work. Joy of joys.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>OK, so <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/daniel/">Dan</a> put me up to this. Pick a topic, and just start writing. So this topic came to mind. How did it come to mind, you ask? Well, I was thinking about our church&rsquo;s service in the park this Sunday. And how much I enjoy it. And how one of the reasons I enjoy it so much is because it&rsquo;s appropriate to wear a t-shirt, shorts, and sandals, even when leading the music. And that led me to thinking about church attire in general.</p>
<p>So what do you wear to church? I&rsquo;m talking about Sunday morning, when you attend the regular weekly service. At <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>, I usually wear a pair of khaki pants and some sort of collared shirt. If I&rsquo;m feeling sloppy I&rsquo;ll wear jeans with the collared shirt. One time I even left the shirt untucked. But usually it&rsquo;s khakis and a collared shirt.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t a universal dress code for our church. Our pastor usually wears dress pants, but may match those with a golf shirt in the summer, other times a shirt and tie, and on rare occasion, add the jacket for the full formal look. On any given Sunday you will see lots of folks in jeans, and in the summer you will see a fair number wearing shorts as well. Given that our air conditioning doesn&rsquo;t keep up very well in the summer, shorts seem like an attractive option at times.</p>
<p>Having said that, I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to wear shorts to church. Why? I suppose part of it is thanks to my mother, who was firmly against wearing shorts to church, even for Wednesday night activities. Old habits die hard. Another part of it is that if I&rsquo;m up leading music for the service, I figure not everybody wants to have to look at my bare legs. And I suppose another part of it is that I know there are people in the church who probably are against wearing shorts on Sundays, and as part of the leadership I don&rsquo;t feel the need to push the point. I&rsquo;m not caving in to their legalism, I just don&rsquo;t feel like making an issue of it.</p>
<p>I had a discussion on this topic with my in-laws some time back when they were visiting. They come from the &ldquo;dress your best to honor the Lord&rdquo; school of church attire. Interestingly, they were also missionaries in Indonesia for a few years. So I wanted to ask if just going in a loincloth and other similar tribal garb would be OK. They didn&rsquo;t bite. It&rsquo;s based on culture, they said. We should look our best to honor God.</p>
<p>But what about that verse that says &ldquo;man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart?&rdquo; I asked. Well, yeah, sure, that&rsquo;s true. But hey, we&rsquo;d dress nicely if we were going to meet the President, right? So why do we dress sloppily when we go to church? Do we have more respect for the President than for God? At this point I&rsquo;m shaking my head a little bit.</p>
<p>Then they noted that the youth pastor at their church (a megachurch in Charlotte, NC) got some very bad reactions from older folks in their church because he didn&rsquo;t wear a tie to their formal service. He was wearing a jacket over a polo shirt for the &ldquo;informal&rdquo; service, which had just gotten over, and he just wore that to the &ldquo;formal&rdquo; service as well. And they mentioned this to me as an example of people being disrespectful with the dress code. I think about that time I asked how much improved the service would be if the pastor just left on his polo shirt but the old folks started thinking about God instead of worrying about the pastor without a tie. I think the discussion went downhill from there.</p>
<p>So if you happen to be in Noelridge Park in Cedar Rapids, Iowa around 10:30 this Sunday, you&rsquo;ll probably hear me playing my guitar, leading some singing. Pretty much guaranteed I&quot;ll be wearing cut-off shorts, a t-shirt, and my sandals. And having a lot of fun doing it.</p>
<p>And thanks, Dan, for the suggestion. It&rsquo;s the most fun I&rsquo;ve had blogging in quite a while. I&rsquo;ll have to do it again sometime.</p>

			 <p>I wait far too long between blog posts, and then I find myself searching for interesting things to write about. I guess my life, if not boring, is at a minimum mundane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adjusting to actually being in the office all week this week; it&rsquo;s been about a month since I did an actual five-day in-office stretch. It&rsquo;s not too bad.</p>
<p>Took Andrew and Rebecca out for dinner last night, then they watched the girls while Becky and I went to see the new Pirates of the Carribean movie. My take on the movie: parts of it were quite fun, comic even, and it certainly hearkened back to swashbuckling movies of old. My main grip with it was that it didn&rsquo;t really resolve much; it was too directly setting you up for Pirates 3, which will come out next year. It felt much more like the end-of-season cliffhanger on a TV series than the satisfactory conclusion of a movie. But still&hellip; Johnny Depp is hilariously over the top.</p>
<p>I picked up a Virgin Wireless cell phone yesterday to be my travel phone. Roaming is horribly expensive on our current US Cellular plan, and we don&rsquo;t really need it often. However, now that I&rsquo;m traveling more for business, it&rsquo;d be nice to be in touch for less than $0.69/minute. So I now have a pay-as-you-go phone that I&rsquo;ll use for my travels. It has a Cedar Rapids number, which I&rsquo;ll be happy to give you if you&rsquo;re wanting to keep in touch with me while I&rsquo;m on travel.</p>
<p>What else?. The folks and Aaron are coming down this weekend to celebrate Laura&rsquo;s birthday. Andrew interviewed for a job here in Cedar Rapids yesterday; it sounds like he&rsquo;ll be living here and taking some classes as Kirkwood this fall. I heard rumor that Aaron may be looking at moving to Florida&hellip; but haven&rsquo;t heard anything specific yet.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the (mundane) news from Iowa today. When I think of something more interesting, I&rsquo;ll be sure to post it.</p>

			 <p>Tuesday through Thursday of this week took my on my first trip ever to Seattle, WA. Several of us from work were headed out to talk to the big airplane manufacturer from that area. And hey, Seattle was nice. Very nice. The trip there, however&hellip; well, it was an adventure.</p>
<p>I departed the Eastern Iowa Airport at 6:55 am and took a little turboprop up to Minneapolis. From there, we had a connection on Northwest Airlines to get to Seattle. At this point in our little drama, I&quot;ll let the pilot handle our narration.</p>
<p><em>9:25 am</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, this is your captain here from the flight deck. We have to wait just a couple of minutes for air traffic control spacing, then we&rsquo;ll be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>9:35 am</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, your captain here again. The ATC spacing wasn&rsquo;t going to take this long&hellip; but while we were sitting here, the self-test on one of our electronic devices indicated a fault with a battery&hellip; so we&rsquo;re going to have to turn back to the terminal and get maintenance to look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>9:45 am</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, your captain again. To do this repair, we&rsquo;re going to have to ask that you all deplane while the maintenance crew works on the plane. You can leave your personal items here on the plane, but we&rsquo;ll need to ask you to deplane for a little while. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>10:30 am</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;For those of you on Northwest Airlines Flight 171 to Seattle, we have some good news, the battery has been replaced and everything seems to check out, so we&rsquo;re going to get ready to reboard the plane at this time&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>11:30 am</em></p>
<p><em>The airplane takes off en route to Seattle.</em></p>
<p><em>12:03 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello folks, your captain here again&hellip; we&rsquo;ve had a minor hydraulics issue, really nothing to worry about, it&rsquo;s just a redundant system, but we&rsquo;re going to have to turn back and land at Minneapolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d apologize, but that would infer that we did something wrong up here&hellip; so we&rsquo;re going to have to fly around an hour or so to burn off some fuel so we can land. So sit tight and I&rsquo;ll get back to you in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>1:37 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, your captain here again&hellip; it took us a little longer to burn off fuel than we thought. But now we&rsquo;re headed back in to land at Minneapolis. When we land, you&rsquo;ll probably see some fire and rescue units on the runway there waiting for us. It&rsquo;s just a precaution. They&rsquo;re very cautious there at Minneapolis and the trucks aren&rsquo;t really needed but they&rsquo;re going to have them out anyway, haha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, one of the few things that was affected by this hydraulics issue was the steering on the nose wheel. That means that we won&rsquo;t be able to taxi off of the runway, so they&rsquo;ll have to bring a tug out to pull us in. So, it&rsquo;s not a big deal, but it&rsquo;ll take a little while. So sit tight, and thank you for your patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>At this point the plane comes in and lands, and it&rsquo;s a very tough landing. Well, the landing is OK, but the thrust reversers don&rsquo;t kick in on landing, and the pilots have to stand on the brakes to get the plane to stop. Finally the plane pulls to a stop and yep, there are the fire trucks.</em></p>
<p><em>1:53 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, about this little delay&hellip; one of the things that happens when we land like that is that we used our brakes quite a bit and so they got kind of warm. And it&rsquo;s nothing to worry about, not a big deal, but the folks here at Minneapolis are very cautious, ha ha, and they want to watch them for a few minutes as they cool down. So sit back and relax, and they&rsquo;ll have us to the terminal in just a few minutes. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>2:02 pm</em></p>
<p><em>The tug attaches to the plane, and slowly and jerkily pulls it around to a gate on the far end of the Northwest Airlines terminal. Finally it slows to a stop.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Flight attendants, disarm doors and prepare for arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>2:07 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Flight attendants, re-arm the doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>2:11 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks&hellip; Those of you on the left side of the aircraft may be seeing a little bit of smoke out your windows. It&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. The plane is fine. But it appears that the tug that pulled us in got a little warm and caught fire, so the emergency guys appear to have that under control, and we should be deplaning shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flight attendants, disarm doors and prepare for arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>2:20 pm</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi folks, we&rsquo;re about ready to get you off the plane here. If you&rsquo;re a first-class passenger, when you get off, head to gate F7 for your courtesy package. The rest of you, we&rsquo;ll have a courtesy package with some meal vouchers here at the gate. We are planning on having another plane ready for you to depart again here shortly, our current scheduled departure time is now 3:40 pm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, the story becomes less eventful. A new plane is found, and we make it to Seattle at 5:30 pm Seattle time, only about 5 hours later than originally planned.</p>
<p>One of my co-workers on the plane was formerly a Delta airlines pilot and has thousands of hours in 757s. He spoke to our pilot afterward and found out that the main hydraulic system had totally failed shortly after takeoff. That means that in addition to not having nose-wheel steering, we only had electrical power for the flaps (allowing only 20 degrees of flaps instead of the usual 30 degrees), we didn&rsquo;t have much in the way of thrust reversers, and there was an assortment of other pieces that were disabled. My co-worker said that there are about six pages of checklists that the pilots have to go through before landing in that condition. Yikes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that our next trip to Seattle (scheduled for the first week of August) is slightly less eventful.</p>

			 <p>Yeah, that dream. The one where Andy Osenga and some other unidentified people are holed up with me in a house (not my house, dunno what house it is) when bad guys show up with guns. We call 911, but the cops are in on it, so no help there. We are tricky, though, and manage to escape out the back way. We run behind a little hill and hide and we&rsquo;re laying in the water in this lake, peering over the hill, watching the bad guys search through the house.</p>
<p>Maybe the bad guys were looking for the automatic weapons that we had found hidden in the attic of the house; they were up there in the rafters next to the 100 baud modem. I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that one.</p>

			 <p>I bought a new pair of Asics running shoes over the weekend and wow, what a difference they make! Beside the fact that they don&rsquo;t tear up my heel like the old ones did, they also have a much greater amount of padding and bounce when I run. What a nice change! Here&rsquo;s to hoping I stay disciplined with the running so that I wear this pair out sooner than the last pair. :-)</p>

			 <p>It has been a nice morning thus far. I got up at my usual early hour, got motivated enough to go run (woohoo! it feels good.) and then decided somewhat on a whim (and also influenced by the absence of any milk in the house for my cereal) to go grab a light breakfast at the little restaurant in the Hy-Vee grocery store. I took my Bible along to read a little, and figured it&rsquo;d be a nice way to get the morning started.</p>
<p>Not two minutes after I walked in, Sam walked in behind me. He and I used to have breakfast there on a regular basis, but my busy schedule put an end to that a couple of months ago. So it was really serendipitous this morning to have him show up and join me for breakfast. We got to chat for a bit, mostly about work and stuff, but still just good to catch up.</p>
<p>So Lord, I hope You&rsquo;re not too put off that I didn&rsquo;t read like I was planning to; that one Psalm was good stuff, though. I will assume that You decided it was more important that I visit with Sam this morning. And I&rsquo;m OK with that. Thanks.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s now been 10 days since I&rsquo;ve actually set foot in my office. Last week was the conference to Atlanta, and then I took Friday off. Now it&rsquo;s Monday, and I get today and then tomorrow off for Independence Day. It&rsquo;s gonna feel weird to actually go back to work&hellip; but there will be a lot to be done.</p>
<p>This weekend we have the whole family here at the house; Ryan came in from Chicago, Aaron is back from Panama, Andrew and Dad and Mom came down from Wisconsin, and Rebecca is now in Cedar Rapids but she came over here to spend the night with the family. Good times. Aaron has become a total Caedmon&rsquo;s Call fanatic :-) and has become very, very good on the guitar. It&rsquo;s fun to be able to just sit down and sing Caedmon&rsquo;s or Derek Webb songs with all the harmony and stuff.</p>
<p>This morning after breakfast I went on a long bike ride - probably 15 miles or so. It&rsquo;s been too long since I&rsquo;ve been out for a good ride. It feels good; I need to be more active. I gained 5 pounds on my business trip last week; too much good food and too much sitting on my backside.</p>
<p>This afternoon we&rsquo;ll grill out and then I dunno what we&rsquo;ll do tonight - Rebecca&rsquo;s gotta work, but the rest of us will still be here until tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>This is the first time I’ve ever visited Atlanta. I’ve driven through a few times, but that doesn’t count. I’ve driven around the north end of Atlanta for a while the past few days, and there are things that stick out. There are churches everywhere. I didn’t think that Iowa was that godless, but I can’t believe how many more churches it seems like there are here. And BIG churches. Wowza. There’s also a lot of Chick-fil-a restaurants. We have one in Cedar Rapids, but I think there’s one on every corner here in Atlanta. But all the signs still say “Closed Sunday”, though, so that’s cool.</p>
<p>I have a theory that not all of Atlanta is under construction, but I’ve yet to see too much evidence to back that theory up. I’ve seen construction everywhere. There’s construction at the airport. There’s construction at the hotel/convention center where I’m at. I’ve been to two shopping malls, there is construction at both of them. I’ve been through road construction on every trip so far. Sheesh people, get things fixed already!</p>
<p>I am a bit surprised that the accents I’ve heard so far aren’t that thick; certainly not near so much as the ones I heard in Tennessee and Kentucky last week. Maybe I just haven’t talked to the right people. My waitress last night had a German accent; the guy I’m listening to at the conference right now has an Indian accent so think I can’t even understand him. Maybe I’ll get a better reading on accent tonight when I have dinner with <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/">Jeff</a> and <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/adriene/">Adriene</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, Atlanta has been A-OK so far. That being said, there’s no place like home.</p>

			 <p>After hearing the announcement that &ldquo;much rock will be had&rdquo;, I decided if I could make it work in my schedule, I&rsquo;d head on a road trip to Nashville to see <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andrew Osenga</a>&rsquo;s <em>The Morning</em> CD release concert. The schedule worked out, and next thing you know, I was on the road.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as bad a drive as I&rsquo;d feared from Cedar Rapids to Nashville. I left at 4:30 am, and with very minimal stoppage I arrived in Nashville by 2:30 pm. I checked into my motel and then left to drive around and aquaint myself with the Nashville area. I drove past one shopping mall that was very dead, and then another one which turned out to be the Green Hills Mall that <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Andy Gullahorn</a> sings about. After having located Mercy Lounge and how to get there, I went back to my motel to crash.</p>
<p>I apparently gave myself too much time to get down to the Lounge, because I got there about 30 minutes before the published &ldquo;doors open&rdquo; time. Deciding to escape the heat and humidity outside, I stuck my head in and managed to hear the end of Andy and the band&rsquo;s sound check.</p>
<p>There were two openers for Andy; the first was Dave somebody; he sported a Napoleon Dynamite-style afro and a bunch of falsetto vocals with his acoustic guitar. Not bad, but not very memorable. The second act was Matthew Perryman Jones. MPJ is one of the <a href="http://www.squarepegalliance.com">Square Pegs</a>, but I hadn&rsquo;t heard any of his music until that night. He was very good. He played a few songs solo, then brought Andy O, Cason Cooley, and Eric Weigel up to play with him. Again, very good stuff. I bought his new CD <em>Throwing Punches In The Dark</em> after the show.</p>
<p>Then it was time for Andy. He was playing with a full band: Cason Cooley on keyboards, Eric Chris Weigel on bass, Paul Eckberg on drums, and a guitarist Jason Feller on guitar, and a percussionist whose name escaped me. They played a lot of music from Andy&rsquo;s new album <em>The Morning</em>, starting out in album order with <em>In Gym Class In High School</em>, <em>After The Garden</em>, and <em>White Dove</em>. He played a few songs from his earlier album <em>Photographs</em>, including <em>Kara</em> and <em>When Will I Run</em>. The highlight of the night was probably his rocking <em>Santa Barbara</em> from the new album. It is a classic roll-the-windows-down rock and roll song, and it was great that night.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the show, and also the chance to meet a bunch of folks, some I had already met, some I had not. This is where I name drop (though is it really name dropping if the people are only &ldquo;names&rdquo; to a few people?) : <a href="http://www.gfmorris.net">Geof Morris</a> (of <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net">rmfo.net</a> fame), Ron Davis (aka Ronzilla) of <a href="http://www.moreron.com">moreron.com</a>, a couple of other dot.netters, and then in addition to the aforementioned band members, there were <a href="http://www.jeremycasella.com">Jeremy Casella</a>, <a href="http://www.chrismason.com">Chris Mason</a>, <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andy Peterson</a>, Ben Shive, <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a>, and oh yeah, Andy O&rsquo;s wife Alison. Very cool.</p>
<p>After helping carry Andy&rsquo;s gear down to his car, I called it a night and crashed hard at the motel. The following day brought me back on the reverse trip from Nashville to Cedar Rapids; again about a 10 hour drive. It was a great time, well worth the drive. As I told Andy, next time I&rsquo;ll come back, but I&rsquo;ll bring my wife along. :-)</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I had an unhappy occurrance. I had stopped at Quik Trip to get some gas on my way to work. When I got back in the car and turned the key: nothing. No lights, no radio, definitely no engine turning. I checked the basic things I know to check (battery cable connections, fuses, etc) and found nothing apparently wrong. So I coasted it down from the gas pumps into a parking spot and walked the 6 blocks home and took the minivan to work. Soon I got a tow truck called and since my preferred mechanic was booked full until Tuesday (a day on which <a href="/06/06/road-tripping/">I plan to be on the road</a>), I had the tow take it to the local Saturn dealership&rsquo;s service department.</p>
<p>Two hours later I get the phone call. They checked everything out, my alternator is fine, my battery is fine. However, I had a bad connection with a battery cable/terminal. So they replaced it, and now the car starts fine, even better than before. However, they did notice that a motor mount had collapsed and needed replaced. I did a quick bit of investigation, ascertained that motor mounts are probably important, and had them replace it. So by 3 pm they had sent a nice lady in a courtesy car to pick me up, and upon my payment of around $200, I got a car back that had a new negative battery cable, a new motor mount, and an oil change.</p>
<p>What I had not realized was how much of a difference the motor mount made. The engine just feels tighter now. It accelerates better. It&rsquo;s just all-around improved. I took it for a spin up a few exits on the interstate last night with the windows down and the cool night air in the cabin, and it was glorious. Oh, and the car ran really nicely, too. I think it&rsquo;s ready to make the trip to Nashville next week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ever buying a used car, I could recomment the &lsquo;99 Saturn SL - at least, my &lsquo;99 Saturn SL. We bought it 5 years ago, have put 70k miles on it, and so far the only two repairs have been an oxygen sensor back in &lsquo;03, and now the motor mount. That&rsquo;s a level of repair I can handle.</p>

			 <p>Having been disgusted with my lack of exercise for a while, and having been challenged by my wife&rsquo;s initiative to start swimming on a regular basis, I bit the bullet yesterday and set my alarm back an extra half-hour so I could get up and run to start the morning. Yesterday morning wasn&rsquo;t too bad - I was ready to get up at 5:15, I did about 2 miles in 20 minutes, and felt pretty good. Woohoo!</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this morning. 5:15 seemed much earlier. I was sore. But I argued enough with myself to go ahead and get out of bed and do it again. But my heel was hurting this time; it felt like it was rubbing funny against my shoe, enough to hurt a bit, but I didn&rsquo;t think there was much to it. Finally I sat down on a park bench about half-way through my run, and found that I had a bloody sock to rival Curt Schilling&rsquo;s. Bummer. I guess it was worse than I thought. So I&rsquo;m wearing my sandals to work today, and I&rsquo;ll have to figure out what to do with the shoes this weekend. I&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;em for 3 years or so, but haven&rsquo;t worn them that much - they should still be in decent shape&hellip; oh well, I&rsquo;ll figure it out this weekend.</p>
<p>So anyway, now I&rsquo;m at work feeling a little bit sore. But that feels good - much better to have sore muscles than to be feeling fat and lazy. :-)</p>

			 <p>That&rsquo;s actually not a bad thing, just a statement of fact. Had a nice weekend; installed a screen door on the side entrance to our house. It went pretty easily, but I ran down the batteries in my drill and had to wait until Sunday for them to charge up so I could finish the job. <em>Note to self: pick up a cheap electric (plug-in) drill sometime so that doesn&rsquo;t happen again.</em></p>
<p>Sunday was nice, church in the morning went well, then finished the aforementioned screen door, then later on we took Laura to the splashpad at the park. She&rsquo;s still a little bit scared of the water, and quite a bit intimidated by the throngs of (larger) kids, but she&rsquo;s figuring it out and getting braver. I have to keep reminding myself that she&rsquo;s not even 2 yet. Amazing. Then we came home and I washed all of the nasty tree pollen and junk off the car, Laura helped with that, too. Give her a wash rag and she has all sorts of fun. Becky took some pictures, if they turned out I&rsquo;ll have to post one.</p>
<p>It was awesome sleeping weather last night; it only got down to about 70 in the house, but the humidity was really low. Nice to have the windows open again and the a/c off at least for a day. Now it&rsquo;s Monday and back-to-work time. This afternoon is softball&hellip; it will be fun to play again after a week off for the holiday. I&rsquo;ve got <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy O</a>&rsquo;s <em>The Morning</em> playing on the iPod for about the zillionth time since I got it, and it&rsquo;s still good. Probably even better than the first several times. More good stuff to appreciate each time. You&rsquo;ll probably get tired of my raving about <em>The Morning</em> before I get tired of raving, so just get used to it&hellip; or go buy the album and joing the raving maniacs. :-)</p>

			 <p>Well it&rsquo;s long past time for a weekend update.</p>
<p>Becky&rsquo;s folks have been here for just over a week now (since May 20th) and we&rsquo;ve been enjoying their visit. They will be leaving tomorrow to continue on their adventure across the USA. Becky&rsquo;s mom is <a href="http://thehubbs.net/bobandcarol/">blogging their adventures</a>, you might want to follow along! But that&rsquo;s not about the weekend, now, is it?</p>
<p>Friday night my folks, my brother <a href="http://thehubbs.net/ryan/">Ryan</a>, and sister <a href="http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/">Rebecca</a> came to visit. It was great to see them again. Rebecca is getting ready to move down to Cedar Rapids in a few weeks, so we&rsquo;ll be seeing quite a bit more of her, I think. Which would be a good thing.</p>
<p>Saturday we didn&rsquo;t do too much; some shopping occurred, and Becky and I went to a graduation party for a young man from church.</p>
<p>Sunday was busy. I led the WT playing the bass for the first time. It went pretty well, and I sure enjoyed playing bass. Wish I had an opportunity to do it more often. But I&rsquo;m not about to want to get rid of the bass player we already have - he&rsquo;s awesome. Then at the end of the first service we dedicated Addison. Then the second service was pretty much the same except we had two baptisms, and no baby dedication.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon we all went out to Stone City to visit the Berberich&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s always a good time. Stayed there until around 6:30. Then late Sunday night Becky, Ryan, Rebecca and I went to see the new X-Men movie. It was pretty good, but not nearly as good as X1 and X2. Still, it was fun to go out on the town and have mom and dad stay home with the kiddos. :-)</p>
<p>Monday we slept in, grilled out, and then my family took off for their homes. So things are finally calming down. But then last night Laura was up 6 times during the night throwing up. She was one unhappy camper. We quickly progressed through all the sheets we had for her crib, and then went to blankets and towels. She was sleeping OK, but just kept waking up vomiting. Yuck. But Becky reports that she&rsquo;s doing better today, that some food is staying down, so hopefully she&rsquo;s on the mend.</p>
<p>With so little sleep last night, something tells me I won&rsquo;t manage to stay up through the whole Suns-Mavericks game tonight&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve heard just about enough about The DaVinci Code by now.</p>
<p>First, the hoopla over the best-selling novel.</p>
<p>Then, the adulation from the press and all of the discussion regarding the &ldquo;historicity&rdquo; of the fiction.</p>
<p>Next, the Christian reaction to the movie, covering the entire spectrum from &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; to &ldquo;Yawn&rdquo; to &ldquo;EVIL, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES AND BURN THE HERETICS WHILE YOU&rsquo;RE RUNNING!!!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So it was with some hesitation that I read a piece on <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com">Opinion Journal</a> today entitled <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110008401">&ldquo;Debunking the Debunkers&rdquo;</a>. The topic: how would C.S. Lewis have responded to DaVinci Code fans? I was glad I read the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have been reading poems, vision-literature, legends, myths all my life,&rdquo; Lewis wrote. &ldquo;I know what they are like. I know that not one of them is like this [the Bible].&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So said Lewis, and he was right.</p>
<p>The wrap-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the real harm of these modern conspiracy theories: They may appeal to our emotions, but they violate our common sense. They reject reason, just as surely as they reject revelation. &ldquo;I do not wish to reduce the skeptical element in your minds,&rdquo; Lewis explained. &ldquo;I am only suggesting that it need not be reserved exclusively for the New Testament and the Creeds. Try doubting something else.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

			 <p>Monday night was our second church softball game of the year, and it was beautiful. We were afraid the rain was going to keep us from playing, but it held off until just after we finished. The night was perfect, we had enough players, and we played solid the whole game. We got hits when we needed them, even our weakest players drew some walks, came around and scored, and I managed a couple good defensive plays at third base. This reminds me why I enjoy softball so much - the fun with friends, a good competitive game&hellip;. what a blessing, and good times.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday my PDA totally locked up, just froze with the backlight on and nothing on screen. Finally last night the battery gave out. But apparently there is happy news! My dear wife reports from home today that when she plugged it in to the charger, it came back up and appears to be working correctly. Let&rsquo;s hope that it keeps it up - I don&rsquo;t like my choices for replacing it, even if I could afford them:</p>
<p>First there&rsquo;s the Palm brand products. I like their OS, but I&rsquo;m getting a sour taste in my mouth for them after my recent troubles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap-o Palm Zire 22. Does most of what I need, but has a lousy screen (160x160 res) and is under-powered. $99.</li>
<li>Palm Tungsten E2. What I have right now. Causing problems after 9 months. $199.</li>
<li>Palm Tungsten TX. Bigger screen than what I have, plus it has Wi-Fi built in. $299.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, I could make the big leap and go to the ones running Windows CE, or whatever the heck they call it now.</p>
<p>The trouble there is that the bottom-of-the-line units start, price-wise, about the same place that the Palms stop. I could get the basic Dell Axim for about $250 right now, <em>sans</em> case and extended warranty.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope my E2 is back alive and good to go for a while. As much as I rely on it to keep me on schedule, $250 for a product that lasts only 9 months is ridiculous.</p>

			 <p>On the heels of my stereo receiver biting the dust, tonight I pulled my Palm Tungsten E2 out of my pocket to schedule a lunch meeting, and it came up dead. The backlight stayed on, the screen was blank, and it wouldn&rsquo;t respond to a reset, even a hard reset. I&rsquo;ve only had it for 9 months. Of course, the Palm warranty is only 90 days&hellip; what a rip-off.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what I want to do about a PDA now. I might try going without it for a couple weeks and see how much I miss it&hellip; but I know it&rsquo;ll be bad. If I hadn&rsquo;t just spent $200 on a stereo, buying a new PDA wouldn&rsquo;t seem totally out of the question, but now&hellip; grrr&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not very motivated to want to buy another Palm brand PDA. I&rsquo;ll have to see what kind of employee discount I can get on a Dell handheld, maybe.</p>

			 <p>[Kudos to Roger for playing along with the Veggie Tales reference.]</p>
<p>A follow-up on <a href="/06/05/stereophonic-multimedia-event/">yesterday&rsquo;s adventures</a> with the stereo receiver. I hit my local Best Buy last night (and boy, do we need some competition for them in town, but that&rsquo;s another post&hellip;) and ended up purchasing a Yamaha HTR-5930 receiver. It&rsquo;s got the usual bells and whistles: Dolby ProLogic and DTS decoding, 100 watts per channel, etc. It was actually quite easy to hook up last night and get running; more intuitive than the Onkyo that died.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t have time to play with it much last night - it was getting too late. But a little bit of LoTR:The Two Towers on DVD was enough to assure me that this thing will kick out some serious sound.</p>

			 <p>No, not the blog. My entertainment center, usually. But last weekend for some reason the LCD display of my Onkyo HTS-650 reciever bit the dust. The amp still works, but you can&rsquo;t see the display, so you can&rsquo;t tell what source is selected, or what options, or anything like that. This isn&rsquo;t the first thing to break on this receiver; it totally died a couple of years ago when it was still under warranty. Back then, two trips to the authorized repair shop in Coralville were enough to get it fixed. It&rsquo;s no longer under warranty now, though.</p>
<p>I could take it in to see about getting it repaired, but I&rsquo;m having a hard time being motivated to do that since the thing seems to have a failure history. What&rsquo;s gonna break next? It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to keep taking it in for repairs when after only a few repairs it would&rsquo;ve been cheaper to buy something new.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going stereo shopping tonight.</p>

			 <p>I met Mitt Romney yesterday. Well, if you can consider shaking his hand and saying hello &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; him. Mr. Romney is the governor of Massachusetts and a probable candidate for President in 2008. As with all presidential campaigns, the early path has to run through Iowa. And so Governor Romney found his way to Cedar Rapids to give the commencement address at <a href="http://www.coe.edu">Coe College</a> on Sunday and then meet with various political groups yesterday. One of the groups he was meeting was our Christian Action group here in Linn County. Since the head of that group is also one of our elders at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>, they held the meeting there at our little church. So for half an hour or so, I sat back and ran sound while Governor Romney answered questions brought by our local people.</p>
<p>I have a difficult time trying not to be cynical about politicians. Now, of course, Romney will tell you he&rsquo;s not a politician. But he sure comes across as one. Besides the perfectly-styled hair, the booming voice, the picture-perfect blonde wife who gushes about their family, well, there&rsquo;s something in the performance, too. I was pretty impressed, he was doing a pretty good job at what was, I imagine, his usual 5-minute introductory speech. But then he introduced his wife, and she came up and said a few things about their children and grandchildren. OK, nice so far. But then she says how she knows people have been saying a lot of nice things about her husband, but how she knows that the most important things to him are his family. Now that statement by itself is just fine. But as she says the phrase &ldquo;people have been saying a lot of nice things about my husband&rdquo;, the Governor emits far too loud a chuckle and an obvious &ldquo;aw shucks&rdquo; kind of look. It was so obviously rehearsed that it was painful. And from there on out, the cynicism kicked in. He was just another politician performing.</p>
<p>I suppose the American system is just so big now that it&rsquo;s unreasonable to think that a &ldquo;normal guy&rdquo; could be elected president; so, instead of electing the best &ldquo;normal guy&rdquo;, we have to elect the best politician. But back in my heart somewhere I wish a really real normal guy could make it. I know I&rsquo;m not the only one who feels that way - go read Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Jack Ryan series. He propels his &ldquo;normal guy&rdquo; hero on a path from history teacher and CIA consultant all the way up to POTUS. And of course then Clancy lets him give all the conservative speeches that Clancy (not-so-)secretly wishes a real POTUS would give. So the dream is alive&hellip; just unlikely.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re back to Mr. Romney. It will be interesting to see how his (as of yet unannounced) candidacy goes. His success will largely depend on who decides to run against him. I will also be curious to see if his Mormon beliefs hurt him any. I tend to think that the religious right will look past it. Oh, are we really starting the presidential election cycle <em>already</em>? The season in Iowa seems eternal. I guess we still have one more year of relative peace.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t been a fan of everything Orson Scott Card has ever written (sorry, <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/theophileo/">Keith</a>), but <a href="http://www.chrishubbs.com/2005/11/11/enders-game/">my love for <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em></a> and <a href="/06/02/home-again-home-again/">even greater affection for <em>Speaker for the Dead</em></a> drew me to read the next book in the series, <em>Xenocide</em>.</p>
<p><em>Xenocide</em> picks up Ender and company pretty much where <em>Speaker for the Dead</em> left them. It introduces us to a few new characters along the way, but wrestles with the dilemma of being on a planet where saving the humans there will cause the death of the indigenous species. Card pulls off this drama in his usual thoughtful fashion, asking questions about the nature of life and consciousness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know that this one was quite as good as <em>Speaker</em>. I got a bit lost at the end once they start doing faster-than-light travel. It just got weird there for the last chapter or so. But still, if you&rsquo;ve enjoyed <em>Ender</em> and <em>Speaker</em>, I can definitely recommend that you continue on and read <em>Xenocide</em>.</p>

			 <p>Wow, so it&rsquo;s been far too long since I posted. What&rsquo;s been happening? Last weekend Mom and Dad and <a href="http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/">Reba</a> came down to visit. We had a good time. Saturday we did a little bit of garage saleing and Reba looked at an apartment. She&rsquo;s planning on moving down here in June. That should be interesting. She&rsquo;s going to <a href="http://www.kirkwood.edu">Kirkwood</a> in the fall. They came down Friday night, left Sunday afternoon. It was good to see them again.</p>
<p>Yesterday was supposed to be our first softball game of the season, but it got cancelled due to the weather. It wasn&rsquo;t actually raining, but it had been raining pretty much solid since Friday night. The fields were undoubtedly a mess. So last night we went out for supper and then went to the library instead. It was nice.</p>
<p>Now today we&rsquo;re home. After work I took Laura on a bike ride while Becky worked in the garden. I did about 8 miles, which for my first time out this year, pulling a kiddo in a trailer, isn&rsquo;t too awful. We&rsquo;ll see how sore I am in the morning. :-) It was nice to be out. Gotta love having the <a href="http://www.linncountytrails.org/index.php">Cedar Valley Nature Trail and the Cedar River Trail</a> nearby.</p>
<p>So now it&rsquo;s nearly bedtime. Just finished watching American Idol, and Becky is upstairs trying to get Addison to go to sleep. She just fights it so hard. I&rsquo;m in the process of setting up a blog for my in-laws to use to post stuff about their vacation this summer. The funny part is, they can use my domain (thehubbs.net), and it doesn&rsquo;t seem strange at all. :-)</p>
<p>Well enough randomness for tonight.</p>

			 <p>Only 18 more days until release. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Andy Osenga&rsquo;s already, you&rsquo;ll know exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about; if you&rsquo;re asking &ldquo;Andy O-Who?&rdquo;, let me introduce you to the man who is hands-down my favorite solo artist. Andy Osenga is a wonderful singer, songwriter, and guitar player, formerly of <a href="http://www.thenormals.com">The Normals</a>, currently with <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a>, a member of the <a href="http://www.squarepegalliance.com">Square Peg Alliance</a>, and now releasing his second full-length album in what I hope will be a long and brilliant solo career. (By the way - a link to <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog">his blog</a> has been sitting over in my sidebar for months now. If you&rsquo;d paid attention, you would already know what I&rsquo;m about to tell you. :-))</p>
<p>May 16th will herald the release of <em>The Morning</em>. Andy has released four of the songs on his blog over the past week - if you get over there soon, you may still be able to hear them. <em><a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/24/after-the-garden/">After The Garden</a></em> is a rockin' tune, reminding us that he doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into that acoustic singer-songwriter stereotype. <em><a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/25/santa-barbara/">Santa Barbara</a></em> is only slightly more laid back. <em><a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/25/santa-barbara/">House of Mirrors</a></em> gives a smooth, relaxed vibe that will just leave you wanting to hear it again. And <em><a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/28/new-beginning-and-the-blog-campaign/">New Beginnings</a></em>? Well, as Andy says, it just about sums up the themes of the whole album.</p>
<p>Go and listen to his songs. Then hit <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">his website</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/preorder">preorder a copy today</a>. Or, buy a couple of copies. Heck, stock up on his older stuff if you haven&rsquo;t got it already.</p>
<p>OK, so this is a rather shameless promotion on my part, but seriously, folks, this is some good music, and Andy is just the kind of guy you&rsquo;d want to support by buying his music. I&rsquo;ve already ordered mine. :-)</p>

			 <p>No, wait, it&rsquo;s Tuesday. It just feels like Monday. It was very very hard to get out of bed this morning. It was cool and there was rain pattering on the roof. But no, I had to get up and come to work. When I got to work, I found out that I&rsquo;m losing a good engineer off of my project. Double-grrrrrr. And now I have meetings for pretty much the rest of the day: 10:00, 11:00, 1:00, 2:00, 2:30&hellip; the last three all overlap. Just another day.</p>
<p>On the bright side, you should go over to <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/24/after-the-garden/">Andy Osenga&rsquo;s website</a> and listen to the cut he&rsquo;s got up there from his upcoming album. It&rsquo;s amazing. He&rsquo;s finally taken the chance to really rock out on this one, and it sounds <em>great</em>. I have this album pre-ordered, which means I should be getting it in a couple of weeks&hellip; I can&rsquo;t wait. But hey, I have to. :-(</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last night I had the opportunity to see Caedmon&rsquo;s Call play in concert at the Five Flags Center in Dubuque, IA. It was a great time. The night started off nicely when I was able to find the venue just fine, and found free parking on the street only two parking places away from the arena. Amazing.</p>
<p>I walked into the arena and my first thought was that it was the worst setup for a concert that I&rsquo;d ever seen. This particular arena usually is home to ice hockey and basketball. They had the stage set up against one of the long sides, and then had 40 feet of bare floor between it and the seating. And they hadn&rsquo;t bothered to pull out the low bleachers, so the lowest seats were still about 12 feet off the ground. It was very weird. But the design redeemed itself when I realized that they were going to allow, nay, welcome people to stand on the floor. You could stand right up at the stage. That was pretty cool.</p>
<p>The opening band was a local band called Ineloquent. I&rsquo;d never heard of &lsquo;em before, but they weren&rsquo;t too bad. They have a husband and wife that are lead singers. He looks like one of the old contestants from The Bachelor, and sounds a bit like Dan Haseltine from Jars of Clay. His wife&rsquo;s vocals reminded me just a bit of the Cardigans. Anyhow, they played a 6-song set, then the lights came back up for a 20 minute break while the stage was reconfigured.</p>
<p>As they got the stage set up, I talked to Andy Osenga for a quick minute as he was testing to make sure his pedal board was ready to go. He said that he was excited that they had the whole band back together for the show. Andy got his blog post written sooner than I did, so you should go read <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2006/04/23/dubuque-ia-part-deux/">his thoughts about the show and they fun that they had</a>. It was a blast with the whole band together.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/133544985/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/3c9ef2d8f8.jpg" alt="IMG_3181"></a></p>
<p>They played 13 songs, by my count, and Andy got to do a solo number in the middle. Here&rsquo;s a quick rundown:</p>
<p><em>Lead of Love</em> They started with an oldie. The crowd down around the stage, a group of 200 or so college kids, didn&rsquo;t know it. But they had fun, anyway.</p>
<p><em>Before There Was Time</em> This got the crowd cranking, clapping and having a good time. Nice upbeat stuff.</p>
<p><em>Walk With Me</em> It suprised me a little bit that they&rsquo;d do this one in concert - but it&rsquo;s a good song that features Danielle&rsquo;s lead vocals nicely.</p>
<p><em>The Talk</em> Then it was time (a bit early, but ok) for the talk. This concert was a fund-raiser for a group of students from the University of Dubuque who are going to minister to the Dalits in India this summer. The cause of the Dalits is near and dear to Caedmon&rsquo;s heart as well, so Cliff took several minutes to describe what they go through. This led into the next portion of the concert with songs off of the recent <em>Share the Well</em> album.</p>
<p><em>Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes</em> OK, so this isn&rsquo;t a Caedmon&rsquo;s song, but they sure enjoy doing it. Cliff pulls off a pretty nice interpretation of the Paul Simon vocal (not an easy task!), and it&rsquo;s just a fun way to head into the Indian theme.</p>
<p><em>Share The Well</em> For this one, Garrett moves down to the front of the stage to play the tablas (small Indian drums). They weren&rsquo;t mic&rsquo;d very well - at least I couldn&rsquo;t hear them very well, but still the song was fun. The younger crowd knew this song much better.</p>
<p><em>Bombay Rain</em> This was Andy&rsquo;s chance to sing lead, and he did a great job as usual. It started off a little bit weak with only his guitar, but it cranked right up as they hit the first chorus, and it was all good from there.</p>
<p>As that song ended, it was obvious that the next song on their set list was Andy&rsquo;s solo song. But Cliff called the band back to the stage to do one more India song, since the crowd was enjoying it so much. And Cliff starts out by saying &ldquo;now this is a song that I really like, but I&rsquo;m not sure I remember all of it.&rdquo; To which Andy replies &ldquo;Is it Bon Jovi?&rdquo; The crowd cracked up at that, and then Josh in the background started playing a little Bon Jovi on the organ, and Andy kicked in with the guitar, and next thing you know the crowd is singing along with the chorus of <em>Wanted Dead or Alive</em>. It was a hoot. But the song that Cliff really wanted to sing was&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Sarala</em> He had to tell the story about this one first, and talked for a while. But he remembered the song, and it sounded good.</p>
<p><em>The High School Band</em> This was Andy&rsquo;s turn to do a solo song. The rest of the band cleared the stage, and Andy stole Cliff&rsquo;s acoustic guitar to play while he sang. I&rsquo;ve heard Andy sing this song in concert several times now, and I think this was the best I&rsquo;ve heard him sound singing it. Those high notes are tough, but he just nailed them last night. My only objection was that he <em>always</em> sings that song - I&rsquo;ll be glad when the new album is out and he can sing something newer.</p>
<p><em>Step By Step</em> As the band came back out, Cliff had the crowd sing through this classic Rich Mullins tune a couple of times. Josh was playing the organ, and almost got the crowd lost a couple times with his weird harmonies, which earned him a dirty look from Cliff.</p>
<p><em>I Will Sing - Hope to Carry On</em> The <em>a capella</em> tune I Will Sing gave Andy, Cliff, and Danielle a chance to shine. They were really into it at this point, and the tight three-part harmonies were wonderful. They used that to lead right into Hope to Carry On, which probably qualifies as the oldest Caedmon&rsquo;s song of all time. (Of course, it&rsquo;s really a Rich Mullins song, but&hellip;) This was where the crowd really reached its emotional peak of the night. The band was cooking. Andy was ripping it on the electric guitar. He jumped off of the drum riser at the end. It was awesome.</p>
<p><em>God Of Wonders</em> This brought things back down a bit, but the crowd was still singing right along, and it sounded good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/133545012/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/e742fd38de.jpg" alt="IMG_3185"></a></p>
<p><em>Hands of the Potter</em> This was a fun way to wrap up the set. Todd, Garrett, and Josh all move to the lower stage to play percussion, and the song wraps up with a long drum solo. Good times.</p>
<p><em>Dalit Hymn</em> They pulled this out for an encore, and again Cliff said they hadn&rsquo;t done this one in a while and he hoped he remembered the whole thing. He did seem to have a bit more trouble with it - Danielle was looking at him in bewilderment a couple of times as he sang what must&rsquo;ve been the wrong lyrics. But still, the crowd knew this one pretty well, and it was a good finish.</p>
<p>I got the chance to talk to Cliff and Andy after the show and thank them for a great evening. I suggested to Andy that we need to be able to buy t-shirts with the artwork from his new album on them&hellip; I think they&rsquo;d be awesome. He said that idea, and others, were in the works, if only they could find some funds to get it kicked off.</p>
<p>As we were talking, Todd came out from packing stuff up with a big box of cookies that somebody had made for the band. He said they were gonna get tossed if nobody ate them, so he was out there handing them out to fans in the lobby. The peanut butter cookie I got was huge and very tasty.</p>
<p>My only regret from last night&rsquo;s concert is that Becky wasn&rsquo;t able to come. It was just impossible to find a way to take a one-month-old baby along to the concert, or to leave her home for the evening. Becky hasn&rsquo;t seen Caedmon&rsquo;s in concert before, and this would&rsquo;ve been a great way to introduce her. Well, maybe next time.</p>

My wife has graciously agreed that she could do without me for the night, so I bought my ticket this morning (curses, Ticketmaster, on being the only game in town! one day there will be a reckoning for your extortionary fees!) and will be there tomorrow night.

			 <p>I hadn&rsquo;t realized how burned-out I was getting. When I step back and look at it now, it should&rsquo;ve been obvious. I&rsquo;ve been leading worship at Noelridge for the last 5 years or so, and have never taken off more than about 4 weeks a year. And those weeks were even more work than the weeks that I just led it myself. It wasn&rsquo;t the leading so much; it was the preparation. Planning the service, writing instrumental parts for our various musicians (some need chords! some need notes! some can transpose&hellip; some can&rsquo;t!), practicing beforehand, then leading. First it was one service per week, since last September it&rsquo;s two services. I was getting to the point where I didn&rsquo;t even want to do worship team.</p>
<p>It came to a head last fall. My initial position was that I wanted a bunch of time off. O.F.F. I didn&rsquo;t figure it was feasible, but it sure sounded nice. (It still does, sort of.) After some discussion with the pastor, we decided on a scheme that we started in January. Under this new scheme, I lead solo and usually take requests one Sunday a month, and another Sunday every month I enlist somebody else to plan and lead. God has blessed us with David, who is willing and able to plan, prepare music, and lead. He&rsquo;s been improving every month.</p>
<p>So this month, this upcoming Sunday is the week I&rsquo;m off. Which means I don&rsquo;t have to worry about dealing with worship team practice tonight. I don&rsquo;t have to be there for the early service on Sunday if I don&rsquo;t want to. Heck, I don&rsquo;t have to be there <em>at all</em> on Sunday if I don&rsquo;t want to. And it feels good. It&rsquo;s refreshing. And next week I&rsquo;ll be cranked up and ready to go again.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my little thought for the day: rest is good. Time off is refreshing. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for it. No sense in burning out.</p>

			 <p>Give me a three-day weekend, and do I post any? Nooooo. But it was a very nice weekend.</p>
<p>I had all of Friday off from work. Friday morning I woke up with a very, very sore back - the kind of sore where you can&rsquo;t bend over to reach to flush the toilet because it hurts too much. The back is still sore today, but it&rsquo;s better than it was on Friday. It gets looser during the day, to the point where it&rsquo;s not bad at all, but then it starts all over again in the morning. I&rsquo;m headed to the chiropractor again today to see if he can help. But enough griping. I sound like an old person.</p>
<p>Friday morning we decided to go garage saleing. Normally this isn&rsquo;t a very exciting thing, but it was a nice morning, and I figured I could do the driving and Becky could shop and we&rsquo;d have fun. At the second sale we stopped at, I noticed an electric bass and bass amp sitting out there for sale. I couldn&rsquo;t resist going to check them out. After some drooling, I made an offer of $100 for the pair, and the gal took it. So now I am the happy owner of an electric bass and amp. I wish I could provide more detail on the bass, but there&rsquo;s no name printed on it anywhere. I opened up the back of it, and still, no name. The woman said it belonged to her father, and I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s had it for a while; the insulation on the wires isn&rsquo;t plastic, but rather that woven stuff that I have seen on old wiring in houses. The amp is an old Roland bass amp, about 30&quot; square. All in all, it sounds good. There&rsquo;s a bit of a buzz, but I think the cable connecting the bass to the amp has a bad connector. I&rsquo;m gonna try a new cable tonight. I don&rsquo;t know when all I&rsquo;ll have opportunities to play it (other than for my own fun at home), but I&rsquo;ll find times. And for $100, I couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>
<p>Friday afternoon we went out for lunch and then did some clean-up at home in preparation for Ryan&rsquo;s visit. He showed up around 4 pm. We had a great time seeing him this weekend; Ryan, I hope we didn&rsquo;t work you too hard!</p>
<p>Saturday morning we borrowed the neighbor&rsquo;s pickup and procured a load of topsoil and a load of compost from the local garden center. All that dirt went into the planters behind the garage in preparation for the strawberries that Becky was ready to plant. After that was done, I tilled the garden so she can get some tomatoes started. Then we crashed Saturday night.</p>
<p>Sunday morning was the usual two services at Noelridge. I was unexpectedly without either my flautist (sick) or my bass player (car in the ditch the night before). Regardless, the music went OK. Always a joy to celebrate the resurrection with our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Ryan headed home Sunday afternoon and we didn&rsquo;t do much the rest of the day. Now it&rsquo;s Monday and I have to deal with a full five-day work week this week. :-( But ignore me, I&rsquo;m whining again. Fortunately, this week my evenings should be much calmer.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, as the culmination of a lot of research by Becky, we went out and purchased a backyard play set for Laura. It was on sale at Toys&rsquo;r&rsquo;us. Woohoo for sales! We just barely got the box to fit in the van - we had to remove the back seat and then still bungee the back hatch down. But we got it home in one piece and then got it put up last night. It has a ladder on one side and a slide on the other. It took Laura about 2 tries to get the hand of the ladder, but then she did nothing but climb up and slide down in a circuit about 30 times in a row. I think she enjoys it. :-)</p>

			 <p>This week has finally brought spring-like weather to our little piece of Iowa. Temps will be in the 70&rsquo;s all week. I love it.</p>
<p>Springtime also means it&rsquo;s time to catch up on all those outdoor tasks that have been building up over the winter. Last night we did some cleanup in the garden. I&rsquo;ll probably get the tiller out this weekend so Becky can plant some tomatoes next week. I also pulled the grill out of the shed and put the snowblower in its place. And the picnic table is now out of the garage and back on the patio in back. There&rsquo;s still plenty more to do, but it&rsquo;s good to at least get things started off. My natural laziness dislikes outside work, and my family can tell you that I&rsquo;ve never been one for being outdoors a lot, but I sure love the way it all looks when it&rsquo;s been well-kept. And I need the exercise. :-)</p>
<p>Tonight we&rsquo;re gonna go shop for some type of play-thing for Laura that we can put in the backyard for her to climb and play on. Becky&rsquo;s been doing all the research, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll find something that meets with her approval. :-)</p>
<p>My other piece of rather mundane news is that I found some new footwear for the summer. I&rsquo;ve typically worn out a pair of cheap Walmark brand Birkenstock knock-off sandals each summer, but this season the footwear phenomonon that is <a href="http://www.crocs.com">Crocs</a> has reached my door. I finally found a pair my size and the style I wanted yesterday at the mall. They are very comfortable and amazingly light. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be regretting their purchase.</p>
<p>I just looked at the forecast page and now they&rsquo;re predicting 81°F for the high on Thursday. Note to Mother Nature: we want some spring right now. Please save the 80&rsquo;s for a couple of months. Thanks.</p>

			 <p>OK, so my ankle is a little bit sore this morning.</p>
<p>I wonder if it has something to do with playing soccer barefoot in the church basement with the high school youth group last night?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. :-)</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t hung out with the youth for a while, but did last night at the youth pastor&rsquo;s invitation so we could plan the youth Sunday coming up on the 30th. And yeah, then I had to stick around and play soccer. Good times.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was the annual Eggstreme Easter Egg Hunt out at the Berberich&rsquo;s home in Stone City. This is I think the fifth year that we&rsquo;ve had a hunt at their place. It&rsquo;s a beautiful venue, out in the country with acres of clear lawn and then miles of trails through the woods. This is the first year that we haven&rsquo;t had a big hand in actually organizing and preparing for the hunt; we just showed up. It was nice. :-)</p>
<p>The Berberich family has become like our own family to us; the parents are about our parents' age, and their seven children range from older than me to a big younger than my sister. They&rsquo;re up to 11 (I think) grandchildren now, with a couple more on the way this year. So much fun. Past years we&rsquo;ve gone out to their place on Monday nights to play basketball on their indoor half-court. They are the models of generous hospitality; you are always welcome in their home, and there&rsquo;s always a cup of coffee, a fresh-baked roll, and time for some conversation.</p>
<p>But somehow amidst the busyness of this year, we&rsquo;ve managed to drift apart a bit. That&rsquo;s the way things go sometimes, I guess. As we were driving out to Stone City, I realized that it had been an entire year since we&rsquo;d been out there, and nearly nine months since I&rsquo;d seen the family, dating back to their daughter&rsquo;s wedding last summer. I have occasionally wondered if there was some reason that perhaps we&rsquo;d slipped off their radar screen, some offense we&rsquo;d caused or some misunderstanding that had kept us apart. But what a joy to see them again Saturday, the hugs and the &ldquo;wow, it&rsquo;s been too long&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;is that Laura?!? I didn&rsquo;t even recognize her she&rsquo;s so big&rdquo;. Restored fellowship is sweet.</p>
<p>So we had a great day out there. Laura did her first real hunting for eggs and had fun. We enjoyed the food afterwards and the chance to catch up a bit&hellip; with a hundred or so people there it was hard to have too much time to talk! But we all agreed as we left that we needed to get together again, sooner rather than later. I have confidence it won&rsquo;t be a whole year before we visit again.</p>

			 <p>I placed an order today for some music that I&rsquo;ve dreamed about playing for a long time: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Bolling">Claude Bolling&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006329Y/sr=8-4/qid=1143170448/ref=sr_1_4/103-1345266-4767068?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio</a>. (The link is to the audio CD so you can listen to samples. I ordered the sheet music.) This is some phenomenal jazz/classical/whatever-the-heck-it-is fusion. I dunno when I first heard it - sometime in high school, I suppose, and immediately I wished I could get with a trio and play it. But that seemed unlikely and the folio with the instrumental parts cost about 50 bucks.</p>
<p>Flash forward to today. I was looking online for a decent collection of Debussy piano music, and while browsing, came across the Bolling suite again. I decided that I could now manage the 45 bucks, so I ordered it. I also know a couple good flute players and a really good bass player, so I might just be able to get a little trio together to work some of it up. I know I&rsquo;ll need to get practicing on it - it&rsquo;s some challenging stuff. But I&rsquo;m excited to just give it a shot.</p>

			 <p>By late this evening I&rsquo;ll be the only member of my immediate family still present in North America. My folks, sister, and brother are heading down to Panama to visit my two brothers who are already there. Actually, I&rsquo;m not sure if Ryan is going down today or sometime shortly later&hellip; but that&rsquo;ll leave me as the only one back here in the good ol' US of A. This is a big trip for all of them, but especially for my folks, who haven&rsquo;t been on a trip like this in many, many years. Dad just got his passport done last-minute, but fortunately it got done. So they&rsquo;re off, for a 10-day trip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m slightly jealous, but even with cheap (&lt;$400 round trip from Chicago - Panama City) airfare, I don&rsquo;t think we could quite manage with two kids under 2 yrs old on that kind of trip. :-) We&rsquo;ll be happy to stay home this time.</p>
<p>Have fun you guys! Take lots pictures and have safe travel. I&rsquo;m looking forward to all the stories and pictures when you get back.</p>

			 <p>The server has been down for the last few days, so I haven&rsquo;t been able to update. But now it&rsquo;s back and running, so here goes. Actually, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to update about.</p>
<p>Becky and Addison came home from the hospital on Wednesday. We are slowly getting sleep schedules adjusted and Addison is sleeping decently at night.</p>
<p>I had already planned on taking the whole week off, and what better weekend to take off than the opening weekend of March Madness? I will confess to having watched far too many basketball games this weekend. There were some good ones. I was disappointed when the Hawkeyes lost their first-round game on a miracle shot, but hey, if you leave the door open&hellip;</p>
<p>Saturday morning I had a very minor sore throat; I was feeling pretty tired, but wrote that off to the wacky sleep schedules this week. By Sunday morning that very minor sore throat became a very major sore throat. Thankfully I already had someone lined up to lead worship for me. So instead of going to church, I headed off to MercyCare North, where the doctor took one look at my throat and just shook his head. He did a throat swab for strep and when the result came back and the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; field had four stars in it and was circled, well, I don&rsquo;t think I was suprised.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m home again today. I really was ready to get back to work. Becky, don&rsquo;t take that wrong when you read this. :-) I&rsquo;ve logged on to the work computer here from home to respond to some email and such, but I&rsquo;m sure things are just piling up there waiting for me, and I&rsquo;m ready to get going on it. Maybe tomorrow. The doctor says I should be non-contagious by then. So then if I&rsquo;m only feeling up to it&hellip; The other real bummer is that being still-contagious right now, I have to try to avoid too much contact with the rest of the family&hellip; and it&rsquo;s hard to be home with Laura and not want to spend time playing with her.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my whine for the day. :-)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s Tuesday afternoon, and I&rsquo;m sitting on the couch in a darkened hospital room. There&rsquo;s a little bit of hazy sunlight filtering through the miniblinds behind me, and a muted television sits ignored across the room. My wife is napping, my older daughter is at a friend&rsquo;s house, my newborn daughter is asleep in the bassinette, and I have had a few minutes of precious quiet. Sure, the nurse interrupted it a few minutes ago to check temperatures and pulses, but she is forgiven.</p>
<p>I have realized just a bit over the past couple of days how I thrive on being busy. I <em>am</em> busy, you know. I am a project lead at work. I have a wife and two kids. I lead the worship teams at church and participate in leadership activities there. I&rsquo;ve been playing basketball in two recreational leagues this winter. I maintain websites for <a href="http://thehubbs.net/chris/">myself</a>, <a href="http://thehubbs.net/">my family</a>, <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">my church</a>, and my friends' <a href="http://www.recminusa.org">ministry</a> and <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">business</a>. I have a very hard time slowing down.</p>
<p>This came to me most vividly somewhere around noon yesterday. Addison had been born only nine hours before. Everything had been cleaned up, she was sleeping, Becky was resting, and I had eaten lunch. And I didn&rsquo;t know what to do next. I kept thinking that it was time to head to work, or think about work, or worship team, or <em>something</em>. Surely there&rsquo;s something I should be doing. And it took a while for me to realize that no, there was nothing else I needed to be doing. I should be right here, enjoying the rest, getting to know my new daughter, and caring for my wife.</p>
<p>Why do I feel the need to make it busier? Partly I&rsquo;d like to ascribe it to my mental &ldquo;wiring&rdquo; - I don&rsquo;t handle boredom well. I like to multi-task. My wife marveled one night a couple of weeks ago when I was talking on my cell phone, having an IM conversation, and posting on my blog all at the same time. I hadn&rsquo;t even thought about it; it&rsquo;s just the way I operate. But I think more responsibility lies on the shoulders of my own choices and decisions. I need to make the conscious effort more often to slow down and enjoy the things in life right here around me. Busyness doesn&rsquo;t make life richer; rather, I think that busyness is the thief that steals the richness of the glory that we see in everyday life. It&rsquo;s time to think more about everyday life.</p>
<p>I think Addison is stirring now, so it&rsquo;s time to put this to practice and set down the laptop. The web sites can wait.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday welcomed our little girl Addison Grace into the world. It was a quick labor and delivery; we were at the hospital for a whole 45 minutes or so before she was born. :-) She&rsquo;s a big girl (9 lbs 3 oz) and seems to be doing well. She&rsquo;s had a stuffy nose, but otherwise has been happy to just eat, sleep, and fill diapers. Ahhh, the life of a newborn. :-)</p>
<p>She was born at 3:12 AM on the 13th, so we didn&rsquo;t get much sleep that night. Slept a little better here at the hospital last night. Not the most comfortable bed, but at least we could go to sleep by 9 and sleep until 7 or later with few interruptions.</p>
<p>Laura doesn&rsquo;t know quite what to do with the baby yet; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite registered that it&rsquo;s <em>our</em> baby&hellip; it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how it goes when we all get home tomorrow.</p>

Laura seems to really enjoy riding in it, and it&rsquo;ll have lots of room for us and our stuff especially after we add kiddo #2.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to get some pictures in the next few days. Today it was raining so it was hard to get any.</p>

			 <p>Well, no baby yet. But that still doesn&rsquo;t mean my Monday has calmed down much. :-) We did a bunch of minivan shopping this weekend, and have found one that seems like it might be a good fit; in our price range, in decent shape, etc. I need to get my mechanic to look at it, and the first availability they have is tomorrow, so I guess I&rsquo;ll be patient until then. Actually, <em>my</em> mechanic wasn&rsquo;t available until Wednesday, but a mechanic that a friend recommends highly is available tomorrow, so I&rsquo;ll go with that one. Maybe by then the bank will have gotten back to me on the loan approval.</p>
<p>If Becky goes into labor tonight or something, it&rsquo;ll throw a bit of a wrench in the car purchase works, but it&rsquo;ll be a welcome wrench. The van can wait. :-)</p>

<p>But the decision got made yesterday, and I am off and running on the new project. Yesterday flew by. So much to do! Today is moving at a brisk pace as well. Somehow I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get very bored at work in the next several months. It&rsquo;s a nice feeling.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="/06/01/i-still-feel-the-same/">a previous post</a>, I wrestled with the ideas of being 10 years removed from my teens, but still feeling many of the same feelings that I did back in those years. It&rsquo;s been interesting to see the reaction from my siblings. <a href="http://thehubbs.net/ryan/2006/01/31/ruminations-which-have-nothing-to-do-with-what-i-ate/">It caused Ryan to reflect on his life</a>, which is good&hellip; wait, not that he needs to do more reflecting&hellip; it was just interesting to hear his thoughts. :-) I think <a href="http://thehubbs.net/rebecca/">Rebecca</a>&rsquo;s comment was just that my post scared her. I take that to mean that she was hoping that things would get better as you get older&hellip;</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve had a while to chew on it, let me give my siblings (and anybody else who is still reading this) some more thoughts that might encourage you a bit.</p>
<p>Things have changed. I would be very stupid not to recognize that a lot of changes in my life have brought stability and peace over the past dozen years. Relationship worries have been removed by my marriage and the wonderful relational stability it brings. Monetary worries have largely been alleviated by a good job, which meets my needs and then some. Not that financial worries are never there, but they aren&rsquo;t the how-the-heck-am-I-going-to-pay-for-this-month&rsquo;s-rent type of worries. What-am-I-going-to-do-with-my-life worries have been largely alleviated as I find peace and confidence in God&rsquo;s plan for me here in Iowa, with my family, my job, and my church. So take heart, brothers, sister, the process can be agonizing (and still is for me, at times), but there will be a day, sooner than you think, where you will stop and look back on things much like I just have.</p>
<p>At the end of that previous post I wrote in conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means something that the desires of a dozen years ago are still wandering around in me today. There’s something to be learned from the knowledge that home, wife, and child haven’t fully satisfied them. I know some of the answers, but for today I think I’d rather just sit back and ponder the questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me talk about some of the answers. Well, at least the one big answer. The answer is that the longings built into each of us cannot be totally fulfilled in this life. Many of them can, and growing closer to God daily will help bring that about. But some cannot, will not ever be fulfilled in this life. But that is the constant reminder for us to look forward to that hope that we have of all eternity with Christ.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> reminded us with his last album, we tend to think at times of heaven as this far away country where we will go someday, but that&rsquo;s not the way it is; rather, God and heaven is home, and we are now in the far country.</p>

			 <p>I didn&rsquo;t think it would ever be possible, but at the moment, I feel like I have too much new music to handle.</p>
<p>Within the past week, I have accumulated six new CDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fabulous mix CD from <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/graceycat/">Susan</a> as part of the RMFO Mix CD Circle.</li>
<li>A pretty darn good mix CD from Chris in Houston from the previous RMFO Mix CD Circle. It&rsquo;s a little bit harder stuff than what I&rsquo;d usually listen to, but there&rsquo;s still some quite good stuff there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.inthecompanyofangels2.com">In The Company of Angels: The World Will Sing</a>, the latest offering from <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a>. I got the pre-release for worship leaders as I noted in <a href="http://www.chrishubbs.com/2006/02/21/in-the-company-of-angels-the-world-will-sing/">my previous post</a>. I&rsquo;ve listened through it 3 or 4 times so far.</li>
<li>The Builder &amp; The Architect, from <a href="http://www.sandramccracken.com">Sandra McCracken</a></li>
<li>Beams of Heaven: Indelible Grace 4</li>
<li>Indigo Girls - I picked this up for three bucks at the used bookstore.</li>
</ul>
<p>My excuse for the last two is that I&rsquo;m looking for some good hymns to add to our repertoire at church. And the Caedmon&rsquo;s disk was an unexpected freebie, so that&rsquo;s not too bad. But I just feel like I don&rsquo;t have the time to really dig in and give this music the time it deserves. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to cut down on the CD buying for a while. (Did I say that?)</p>

			 <p><em><a href="http://www.inthecompanyofangels2.com/index.php">In The Company of Angels: The World Will Sing</a></em> is the soon-to-be-released latest album from my favorite musical group, Caedmon&rsquo;s Call. It&rsquo;s a follow-up to their previous release <em>In The Company of Angels</em>, which was one of the best &ldquo;worship albums&rdquo; when the whole worship album craze hit a few years ago. (Has it ever really died down?) While the album doesn&rsquo;t release until March 7th, <a href="http://www.inthecompanyofangels2.com/feedback/">Caedmon&rsquo;s is offering a free copy of the pre-release album</a> to worship pastors who are willing to give them some feedback on how the music might be usable for congregational singing. Happily, I am the worship leader at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge</a>, so I requested and received my free copy last week and have been listening to it quite a bit since then. I&rsquo;ll go ahead and post my thoughts here.</p>
<p>First, let me review it just as an album. The 11 tracks are dominated by Cliff Young&rsquo;s vocals (seven tracks), aided by Andy Osenga and Danielle Young on two tracks each. The songs are primarily new material, but there are three or so that are new settings of old hymns. All in all, it&rsquo;s pretty solid, though I don&rsquo;t think it quite measures up to the original ITCOA. I&rsquo;ll have to listen through a few more times before I can give a definitive answer there. It might be a toss-up.</p>
<p>Now, about the congregational singing aspect of these songs. Noelridge is a small church. Our worship team is small, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of instruments, we&rsquo;re not a group full of pros. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, we have some good people, with real musical talent, but we&rsquo;re never gonna sound like Caedmon&rsquo;s or Casting Crowns or Third Day or the David Crowder Band. It just ain&rsquo;t gonna happen. As a result, for songs to be effective for congregational singing, they need to be fairly simple and repetitive musically, and not too rhythmically complex. Lots of syncopation or ad-lib material will blow us out of the water.</p>
<p>Given those constraints, here&rsquo;s my evaluation of the usability of the songs on the album for congregational singing.</p>
<p><strong>Great And Mighty</strong> - Good stuff, but really too much of a solo-type song for congregational singing. Too syncopated.</p>
<p><strong>Draw Me Nearer</strong> - This one I might use here sometime soon. This is a strong tune, a very nice update to the old hymn.</p>
<p><strong>Sing His Love</strong> - It&rsquo;s an OK song, pretty simple lyrically, maybe too simple. Definitely too syncopated and rhythmic for us to be able to manage. I guess I&rsquo;m not a big fan of this song. I just don&rsquo;t like it that much.</p>
<p><strong>Rest Upon Us</strong> - Here we get Danielle for a song. This is a pretty song, but the verses are far too ad-lib to be workable for congregational singing.</p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong> - Here we get our first taste of Andy O. I really like this song. If it doesn&rsquo;t get some serious radio play time then there&rsquo;s something wrong with the folks that write the playlists. But this is really a radio song, not a congregational Sunday morning song.</p>
<p><strong>The Fountain</strong> - Back to Cliff for this one. A nice song, but again, too syncopated and complicated for us to be able to manage it congregationally.</p>
<p><strong>Be Merciful To Me</strong> - Danielle this time. This one has potential as a congregational number. It&rsquo;s simple, fairly repetitive, and it has a good message. I&rsquo;ll have to give it a shot.</p>
<p><strong>I Surrender All</strong> - Cliff again. This is a re-working of the classic hymn. I really like the harmonic progression in the verses, though the melody line may be so close to the original as to be a bit confusing. The chorus is pretty good, though it goes pretty high, which would make it hard for a congregation to sing. This would be on my maybe list&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>We Give Thanks</strong> - Andy O again. I like this song, I might try to sing along with it if I hear it on the radio. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s singable for a congregation.</p>
<p><strong>Fellowship</strong> - This one I really like. Good lyrics, and I think the song is singable. I will have to give this one a try.</p>
<p><strong>Mercy of my God</strong> - I really like the message in this one, I fear that it&rsquo;s gonna be too tough for my congregation. I might have to try, though, since I like the message so much.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s my roundup of the album. One final note, the CD shipped with just a simple liner giving the song listing. It would&rsquo;ve been nice to know who wrote the lyrics and music for each song. Not that it affects my opinions on the songs any, but as a fan I&rsquo;m curious to know whose hand is in all this stuff. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to wait and buy the official version in March.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;and I haven&rsquo;t posted since last Wednesday, which means I&rsquo;m a real slacker. I fall into this basic pattern of blogging where I show up on Monday, realize I&rsquo;m a slacker, then because I have nothing more thoughtful to post, post a weekend update. Yawn. But since I&rsquo;ve already fooled you into reading this far, here was my weekend:</p>
<p>Friday night Becky and I went and saw <em>King Kong</em> at the <a href="http://www.collinsroadtheatres.com">cheap theater</a>. It was worth seeing on the big screen. It was pretty over-the-top; Peter Jackson would get you squirming, and then when you thought it should be about done, he&rsquo;d make you squirm for another 10 seconds. The plot/story was OK, but pretty basic. The one part I really liked was the way the shots at the top of the Empire State Building were done; they had me fearing the heights even though I was safe in my seat. Well done that.</p>
<p>Saturday morning I headed over to Mount Vernon to accompany a young man from church who was trying out for a voice scholarship at <a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu">Cornell College</a>. It was fun to be on a college campus again, and even more fun to be on one that had good music facilities. If I were on campuses too often, I could definitely get bit by the college bug again and think about studying up enough that I could go back and teach. Sounds fun, but I think it&rsquo;s unlikely.</p>
<p>Played a church league basketball game on Saturday and then headed home. Took Becky and Laura out for dinner and did a little shopping. Oh, and Becky&rsquo;s mom headed home Saturday morning. It was great to have her visit, she was a big help to Becky, and she and Laura had soooo much fun.</p>
<p>Sunday led worship as usual at both services. We were without practice this week, which left us a little bit rough, but it turned out OK. That was about it for Sunday. Stayed home, just a lazy afternoon.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re to Monday and another week. It&rsquo;s not too exciting so far. If it gets exciting, I&rsquo;ll be sure to post about it.</p>

			 <p>And it&rsquo;s about time. We haven&rsquo;t had any snow since December 16th&hellip; that&rsquo;s a full two months. But this morning it started about 6 AM, we even had some thunder and lightning! Becky measured 2 inches of snow by 8:30, and there&rsquo;s more to come. Woohoo! A chance to use the new snowblower, and it&rsquo;ll look like winter again! I just wasn&rsquo;t ready for spring yet in February.</p>
<p>Now if Mr. Murphy has anything to say, Becky will go into labor this afternoon and we&rsquo;ll have to skate our way down to the hospital through all the snow and ice&hellip; or maybe the kiddo can just wait another week or so. (Her due date is March 1, which is less than two weeks away&hellip;)</p>

<p>This is a must-read article by Michael Crichton. His basic premise: we can make statistics say about anything, and so the trend is that the media and other organizations will try to build a big fear of a crisis. In reality, the environmental cycles are fairly normal. His conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this really the end of the world? Earthquakes, hurricanes, floods?<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
No, we simply live on an active planet. Earthquakes are continuous, a million and a half of them every year, or three every minute. A Richter 5 quake every six hours, a major quake every 3 weeks. A quake as destructive as the one in Pakistan every 8 months. It’s nothing new, it’s right on schedule.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
At any moment there are 1,500 electrical storms on the planet. A tornado touches down every six hours. We have ninety hurricanes a year, or one every four days. Again, right on schedule. Violent, disruptive, chaotic activity is a constant feature of our globe.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Is this the end of the world? No: this is the world.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It’s time we knew it.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/06/02/coffeehouse-time/">evening at the coffeehouse</a> went well. I ended up doing a little more instrumental and a little less vocal than I had originally planned, since the place was so full and noisy during the first hour that any attempt at capturing their attention for a vocal would&rsquo;ve been a disaster. Still, I got to sing some, got to play a bunch, and even got some tips! Good times.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ijsm.org">Geof</a> hasn&rsquo;t posted the answer on his blog yet, but he declares (and I agree with him) that the answer to the <a href="/06/02/an-evil-brain-teaser/">evil brain teaser</a> is that yes, the airplane will fly, since the engines are pushing against the air, and the air is unaffected by the conveyor belt. So kudos to <a href="http://thehubbs.net/aaron/">Aaron</a>, who almost immediately came to the right answer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s about all the news from the home front for today. Becky&rsquo;s mom is here to spend the week, we&rsquo;ve been having fun with her, and also we&rsquo;re enjoying having a babysitter for the week! :-) We went and saw <em>The Producers</em> at the theatre on Saturday (good old cheesy Mel Brooks - gotta love it!) and we&rsquo;ll probably go out again either tomorrow or Thursday, kind of a last-chance date before the baby is born. Officially there&rsquo;s about 2 more weeks left&hellip; I guess we&rsquo;ll take it a day at a time.</p>

			 <p>Erik Lokkesmoe has a good article on Townhall.com where he lists <a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/books_entertainment/be_columns/ErikLokkesmoe/2006/02/07/185351.html">10 mistakes conservatives make in art and entertainment</a>. It&rsquo;s worthwhile reading and thinking it over. Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mistake #1:</strong> We try to improve art and entertainment from the top-down and the outside-in. For example, when well-meaning people, flush with cash but bankrupt on talent, attempt to “show Hollywood” by creating films that go around proven creative methods, the result is always the same: direct to video, a waste of time and money. Enduring change, meanwhile, comes from the bottom-up (working your way up from the mailroom) and the inside-out (working within the creative industries).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mistake #2:</strong> We don&rsquo;t quite understand common grace – the idea that the good, the true, and the beautiful can be found in the most “unlikely” of places (Broadway) and people (liberal artists). Without a strong belief in common grace, we will either get angry at the culture or withdraw from it entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mistake #7:</strong> We use the arts to save souls and sway elections. True artists enter their work with a sense of mystery, wonderment, always uncertain what may finally appear on the canvas or film or pages. Children’s author Madeleine L’Engle speaks of her surprise when a certain character appeared unexpectedly in the plot of the novel she was writing. She says, “I cannot imagine the book without [the character], and I know that it is a much better book because of him. But where he came from I cannot say. He was a sheer gift of grace.” A sermon can be artful, and Lord knows campaign ads could use some imagination. Mixing art and agenda, however, is propaganda, whether it comes from the left or the right. If you want to send a message, Samuel Goldwyn rightly said, call Western Union.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mistake #10:</strong> We like safe art. Soggy may be a better term. Easy to digest. Nothing that causes heartburn. Do we really want art that never challenges our convictions, wrestles with our beliefs, or questions our faith? Let’s not forget: beauty is hardly safe, truth is never tame, goodness is anything but trite. Author Franky Schaeffer said it best : “The arts ask hard questions. Art incinerates polyester/velvet dreams of inner healing and cheap grace. Art hurts, slaps, and defines. Art is interested in truth: in bad words spoken by bad people, in good words spoken by good people, in sin and goodness, in life, sex, birth, color, texture, death, love, hate, nature, man, religion, music, God, fire, water, and air. Art tears down, builds up, and redefines. Art is uncomfortable” Finally, and most profoundly, he writes: “Good art (which, among other things, means truth-telling art) is good in itself, even when it is about bad things.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should really read the whole thing.</p>

			 <p>I was thinking through some songs that we haven&rsquo;t sung for a while in church, and this issue came to mind, so I thought I&rsquo;d share it here. One of my main criterion when selecting songs for the church to sing (and I plan the music for almost every week) is that they be theologically sound. This manages to disqualify a substantive number of modern praise songs, and a surprising number of older hymns from our hymnal. I might go so far as to say that this is my primary criterion. Certainly there are others; singability is right up there. But theological correctness has got to be at the top of the list.</p>
<p>So we come to today&rsquo;s topic: the old chorus &ldquo;Create In Me A Clean Heart&rdquo;. The text is pretty much straight from Psalm 51:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create in me a clean heart oh God,<br>
And renew a right spirit within me.<br>
Create in me a clean heart oh God,<br>
And renew a right spirit within me.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Cast me not away from Thy presence oh Lord,<br>
And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.<br>
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,<br>
And renew a right spirit within me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My theological nit is with the fifth and sixth lines. When David penned these words some 1500 years before Christ, the threat of having the Holy Spirit taken from him was quite a real one; he had seen a similar thing happen to Saul when Saul rebelled against God. At that time the Holy Spirit didn&rsquo;t indwell all those who believed in God, but God specifically directed the Spirit to rest on certain people at certain times. But now we&rsquo;re after Pentecost, and so those that believe are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit remains as a seal of our salvation. We&rsquo;re not in danger of having God take it away.</p>
<p>So on to my theological question. While I love the submissive attitude of the first part of this chorus, I have real questions about singing those two lines, because I think they represent a fear or concern that we shouldn&rsquo;t have. Is this an appropriate distinction to make? Or am I being overly picky? Your thoughts are appreciated.</p>

<p>One upside to the trip was the time to do some reading. I should do full BookJournal posts on each of these, but I&rsquo;ll summarize here now just to summarize. (Helpful, no?)</p>
<p>On the way down, I finished reading Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s <em>Speaker for the Dead</em>. Brilliant. Maybe even better than <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>. That man knows how to write. (More on that later.)</p>
<p>After that, I finished up N.T. Wright&rsquo;s <em>What St. Paul Really Said</em>. I thought it was also brilliant. His interpretation of Paul&rsquo;s themes of justification, the righteousness of God, and the Gospel make a lot of sense. I went back and read through Romans after finishing Wright, and there were several places where lightbulbs went on. I&rsquo;ll have to ponder this some more. One thing that bothers me a bit is his conclusion (and I&rsquo;m putting it very roughly here) that Christ&rsquo;s being Lord will result in the Church working to establish His kingdom here on earth. As I understand it, this is a pretty typical amillenial Reformed view of the end times, and I guess I just can&rsquo;t get my dispensational brain around it. If any of my readers could suggest some good reading in that area, I&rsquo;d be grateful.</p>
<p>The reading list isn&rsquo;t done yet, folks. After N. T. Wright, I headed back for some fiction. So I read <em>The Bourne Legacy</em>, which is a new novel by Eric Lustbader written around Robert Ludlum&rsquo;s Jason Bourne character. It was a pretty good book. The writing style was more like a contemporary spy thriller and much less like Ludlum, which was weird. But otherwise the story was good and appropriately muddled. Finished that book as we were pulling up to the terminal in Chicago on the way home.</p>
<p>Then I went back to non-fiction. Some time ago, Keith had recommended <em>Characters and Viewpoint</em> by Orson Scott Card as an excellent volume on how to write fiction. He was right, it is excellent. I&rsquo;ve always had fleeting thoughts of doing some writing, but never really applied myself to it. (Who has the time?) But if I ever were to start, this book would become a primary text for me in helping develop good characters and plots. Card has good insights into what makes fiction work, and he expresses them fairly simply and with some good examples.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m back home and trying to catch up from missing a day and a half of work. Good times.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s not unusual, in my experience, to receive calendars as gifts around Christmas-time from companies you do business with. We always get a desk calendar from our insurance agent which fits nicely on the desk downstairs. We receive a pretty one with Bible verses and inspirational sayings from a missions agency that we support. We got one from the Christian radio station this year that had pictures taken by listeners. Kinda cool. I&rsquo;m sure we got a couple of others as well, I know we gave a Norman Rockwell one away to my Dad.</p>
<p>This year we also got one from our cable provider, Mediacom. It was rather audaciously titled &ldquo;12 months of You&rdquo;, but it appeared to be more like 12 months of them. There were a few coupons inside for free pay-per-view movies (which we never watch), and then the artwork for each month featured one of their cable channels. Color me less than excited.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the best part. You see, most gift calendars come in late November or early December. Mediacom&rsquo;s came on <strong>January 27th</strong>. January 27th! Apparently their 12 months of me is really only about 11 months&hellip; Unbelievable.</p>
<p>The Mediacom calendar is sitting in the recycle bin on my curb this morning, waiting to be picked up by the garbage man. Good riddance.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been a bit haphazard in my posting habits lately, so I&rsquo;ll just dump a bunch of stuff in here in lieu of a real post. I&rsquo;ve been reading lots of stuff lately, just not posting. I&rsquo;ll have to make that change.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m headed to Wichita tomorrow for my DER orientation. It&rsquo;s just a one-day session, so I&rsquo;ll be on the late flight home tomorrow (back to CID at 10:04 PM). So beginning on Thursday, I will officially be a DER Candidate and can start reviewing stuff and recommending approval of TSO items. It&rsquo;s a fairly significant new chapter in my career here.</p>
<p>Next topic: congratulations to my friends Lee &amp; Amber Adams on the birth of their daughter Adi Grace early Sunday morning! Adi is their first, and I&rsquo;m sure they will soon come to find just how wonderful daughters are. :-) Now we just need to take a trip down to see them sometime&hellip;</p>
<p>Next topic: Last night was the talent show at <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">church</a>. I did two songs, opening the show with <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a>&rsquo;s <em>Susan Coats' Pants</em> and finishing up the show with <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Andy Gullahorn</a>&rsquo;s <em>Holy Flakes</em>. Becky noted afterwards that most people&rsquo;s response to the former was &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; She said it&rsquo;s mostly a &ldquo;Chris song&rdquo;, which I think means that my weird sense of humor appreciates it, but most (normal) people won&rsquo;t. Oh well, that&rsquo;s what talent shows are for. The most frequent question after the talent show was &ldquo;where do you find these songs?&rdquo; I take great pleasure in knowing that I can dig up songs that nobody&rsquo;s heard of but that people really like. Of course, I really only get away with it because I&rsquo;m the only one at the church that listens to all of the <a href="http://www.squarepegalliance.com/">Square Peg</a> types.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s it for now. I promise I&rsquo;ll try to write a sensible post soon.</p>

			 <p>I thought I&rsquo;d feel different by now.</p>
<p>I remember sitting in a recliner in the living room of a quiet house after the boys I was babysitting had been sent to bed. I remember thinking what a nice scenario it was: a house, a wife, children, stability. I remember being that high-schooler sitting there, leaning back and trying to imagine, for a moment, what it would be like to be in that position someday. I remember thinking that it would be a great quiet confident feeling to sit back, survey my domain, and relax in the peace that came from such stability. I remember thinking how wonderful it would feel to be that different person.</p>
<p>That was 1993, nearly half a life ago. I&rsquo;m married to a wonderful woman. I own my own home. (No recliner yet.) I have a daughter that is the sweetest little girl that has ever walked the earth. Another child on the way. I have a job that I like, and that likes me. All those things I had wished for, I now find I have. But I still feel like I&rsquo;m the same person. I still have internal conflicts, fears, and doubts. I&rsquo;m still imperfect. (Why did I think that would ever change?) I still worry. I still feel guilt, frustration, and anger. I still wonder about the future. There are still times when I am happy to just crank up my iPod and let the music block the world out for a while.</p>
<p>This is probably my biggest surprise about growing up: that while everything around me has changed, and I undoubtedly have changed, I don&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> like I&rsquo;ve changed. Maybe I lack perspective. Maybe if I compared snapshots instead of the continuum, I&rsquo;d see the differences more starkly. Maybe I&rsquo;m just forgotten what it felt like to be a teenager. But maybe not.</p>
<p>A person twice my age will read this, shake their head, and think <em>I could&rsquo;ve told him that</em>, and it&rsquo;s likely that 20 years from now I&rsquo;ll say the same thing. But today I&rsquo;m not willing to write it off quite that quickly. It means something that the desires of a dozen years ago are still wandering around in me today. There&rsquo;s something to be learned from the knowledge that home, wife, and child haven&rsquo;t fully satisfied them. I know some of the answers, but for today I think I&rsquo;d rather just sit back and ponder the questions. Maybe I need to go find a recliner&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was my first Sunday of just taking a break from leading the worship team. David Green did a very respectable job in my absence. The Lord used this weekend to remind me once again that His plans are so much better than mine. He knew I would need this weekend off.</p>
<p>Laura was difficult all weekend. It&rsquo;s not really her fault; she&rsquo;s teething, which makes her cranky anyway. It was combined with a cold this time (a cold that I have too), so in addition to the drooling, her sinuses are perpetually clogged, and she&rsquo;s been running a 103 degree fever. Tylenol or Motrin will bring the fever down for a few hours and turn her back into her bubbly self, but about 4 hours into the 6-hour dosage, the fever comes back and she gets owly again. She&rsquo;s not sleeping well, either; she&rsquo;s been in our bed the last two nights, which is a last resort for us. We don&rsquo;t sleep well with her in the bed; she&rsquo;s a restless sleeper and snores. However, it&rsquo;s better to lose sleep to a snoring baby in your bed than to a crying baby in the other room.</p>
<p>Sunday I made it up in time to get to the second service at church, so I did get to hear the sermon and the worship team. Like I said, they were pretty good, David&rsquo;s got a good musical sense. Mostly they were just lacking a clear leader. Somebody on the WT has to know where you&rsquo;re going, when you&rsquo;re going there, and then just grab everybody and take them along. That just takes practice, and time doing it. As long as people are willing, I&rsquo;ll be happy to provide them opportunities to practice, and any coaching that I can do along the way.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday. Becky reports that Laura is still feeling bum this morning. Please, Lord, can this teething get done with?</p>

			 <p>Last night Becky was gone to a baby shower at the church, and so after I put Laura to bed around 7 I had a couple of hours to myself. As tempting as it was to sit down and watch <em>Month Python &amp; the Holy Grail</em> (which Becky hates and I haven&rsquo;t watched in a long time), I decided to get some useful stuff done.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;d believe how much you can get done in 90 minutes? I got the dishes done, got most of our income tax stuff figured out (thanks to TurboTax&hellip; now we&rsquo;re just waiting for my W2 and we can file), and got stuff coordinated for worship team this weekend. And I still had time to turn on a movie that was on the Tivo that I thought I might like. It ended up being kinda boring, so I ignored it.</p>
<p>Tonight I have free again. I think I&rsquo;ll do some playing with Photoshop and maybe we&rsquo;ll watch some movie we can agree upon. Either that or we&rsquo;ll start watching the American Idol auditions&hellip; that should be good for a laugh or two.</p>
<p>Oh, I should also add a comment about a new TV show we watched last night - it&rsquo;s called <em><a href="http://hustle.amctv.com/">Hustle</a></em> and it airs on <a href="http://www.amctv.com/">AMC</a>. It&rsquo;s produced by the BBC, and the best way to describe it is as <em>Ocean&rsquo;s 11</em> in a one-hour show. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing a few more episodes&hellip; the first one was pretty good.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>Fortunes of War</em> is a recent title from <a href="http://www.stephencoonts.com">Stephen Coonts</a>. It is in many respects a standard military adventure novel, but it is based on an interesting premise. What if a newly militarized Japan tried to seize Siberia from a weakened Russia? How would the world respond? What might happen?</p>
<p>From there the action is good enough to make it a decent read. The story focuses on two fighter pilots, one American, one Japanese, who are friends but end up fighting on opposite sides. The story almost wraps up a little too quickly and neatly; I was left wishing for something a little less formulaic.</p>
<p>Now, maybe I&rsquo;m a hard audience to please; Red Storm Rising has always been my benchmark of a good war novel. Sure, it&rsquo;s long, and has a gazillion plot threads, and is (like all of Tom Clancy&rsquo;s stuff) overly technical, but that&rsquo;s the way I like &lsquo;em. As much as I wish Clancy and/or Bond&rsquo;s writing schedule would accelerate a bit, I&rsquo;ll take their epics over the consistent (but formulaic) offerings from Coonts any day.</p>

			 <p>The long-awaited <a href="http://www.feedlounge.com">FeedLounge</a> finally opened for public signups yesterday. For those of you not familiar, FeedLounge is a web-based RSS aggregator/feed reader. As a sometime-user of Google Reader and a sometime-user of Bloglines, and never very happy with either, I was excited to hear that this product might be what I was looking for. <a href="http://www.ijsm.org">Geof</a> has been alpha-testing for a while and has sung its praises far and wide, so I was all primed and ready to sign up yesterday.</p>
<p>Having been a FeedLounge subscriber for all of twelve hours now, I can say this: I am not disappointed. FeedLounge has an amazing user interface, good enough that though it&rsquo;s just a web page, it tempts you to think that you&rsquo;re running a separate application. It allows for feed tagging, tagging and flagging of individual posts, and, what may be one of my favorite features already, direct links to subscribe to comments for blog posts that provide you that capability. Fantastic!</p>
<p>FeedLounge won&rsquo;t be for everyone. If you&rsquo;re only subscribing to a dozen or so blogs, just use bloglines or something similar. Also, FeedLounge is a subscription service; $5/month or $50/year. Well worth it, IMO, but that&rsquo;s your judgement to make. But for people like me who are subscribed to hundreds of feeds and want to be able to get at them from anywhere, FeedLounge is a great way to go.</p>

			 <p>I woke up this morning to find that I had very limited, analog cellular service. US Cellular has usually been reliable, so I was a bit suprised. I checked with a few coworkers and found that they had the same problem.</p>
<p>Digital service was restored around 10:30 this morning, but I still didn&rsquo;t have any luck calling out. I walked past a US Cellular office on my way to lunch around noon, and they reported that they had some electrical problems and that most of the towers in eastern Iowa were problematic. As of that hour, apparently inbound service was working, but outbound was still disabled.</p>
<p>As of a few minutes ago (1:20 PM) outbound calling appears to be working again. Specialized calling (for instance, #BAL to get your minutes balance) was still kicking you off to the analog network. Hopefully they&rsquo;ll have it up again soon.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve probably sent in more rebate forms in the last two months than I had in my entire previous 28 years of life. It&rsquo;s starting to drive me nuts.</p>
<p>It starts out innocently enough - a $10 rebate on a spindle of blank CDs. Then all of a sudden it goes nuts on you. $30 on a wireless router. $20 on a wireless network adapter. $60 on Adobe Photoshop Elements. $80 on a new hard drive for the Tivo. $60 on contact lenses. It seems like it&rsquo;ll never stop.</p>
<p>Then we bought a new washing machine. I have 3 forms just for it! One to rebate the $50 delivery cost. One for $100 back from Alliant Energy since it&rsquo;s an Energy Star washer. And then one for a $75 gift card from Home Depot for some promotion they were running. What a pain.</p>
<p>I understand why manufacturers offer rebates; they give an incentive to the shopper (&ldquo;I pay $100 now, but it&rsquo;s only $40 after the rebates!&quot;) while at the same time they&rsquo;re betting that a many folks won&rsquo;t file the rebates on time or correctly (or at all), thus sticking the buyer with the full price. I&rsquo;ve even fallen for it before; when I bought my Dell laptop back in the fall, it had a $100 Dell rebate that had to be filed within 28 days after the computer was shipped. I remembered it on day 29. There was much unhappiness that day.</p>
<p>Rebates <em>do</em> offer a few rays of sunshine, though; months from now when I&rsquo;ve totally forgotten about the $80 hard drive rebate and my budget has absorbed the full cost, I&rsquo;ll get an unexpected check in the mail. That&rsquo;s always fun&hellip; and a good excuse to go out for dinner or something. See, maybe these rebates don&rsquo;t save me any money at all&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Well I&rsquo;ve been a slacker lately as far as meaningful posts go&hellip; don&rsquo;t know how this one will rate.</p>
<p>We had a nice weekend. Stayed home Friday night and crashed. Laura wasn&rsquo;t feeling too good Friday night; she started coughing and got herself so worked up that then she threw up. I don&rsquo;t know if, as a parent, you ever totally get used to being vomited on; however, I&rsquo;m certainly getting practice at it, if not totally comfortable with it. :-) She finally got to sleep and slept well, though, so that&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>
<p>Played church league basketball Saturday and won in double overtime. We were playing a team we totally had overmatched, so we played easy, slacked off. Of course that meant that when it was time to close it out and play seriously, we weren&rsquo;t ready to do so&hellip; so we ended up in 2OT. At least we won&hellip; it&rsquo;s only our second win of the year.</p>
<p>Got a new washing machine delivered on Saturday, too. Our old one was starting to die, and we have intermittent problems with water backup on the drain pipe for the washer. We got a new front-loader that uses only half the water that the old one did. It&rsquo;s also amazingly quiet. I think it&rsquo;ll prove to be a good investment.</p>
<p>Sunday we had a pleasant surprise - my mom stopped by on her way home from Omaha. She had been there on sad business (her step-brother is dying), but it was good to get to see her anyway. We took her out for a late lunch and had some yummy mexican food that I had been craving for a while&hellip; I know, now I sound like the pregnant one. ;-) After mom took off, we crashed, watched the Bears get beat in the playoffs, and audited giving receipts so I can get them sent out this week.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Monday and I&rsquo;m back at work, reviewing TSO deviations and waiting for the <a href="http://feedlounge.com">FeedLounge</a> beta to go public so I can sign up. That&rsquo;ll probably be worth another blog post in itself. :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Occasionally when I walk through our building here at work to get to the cafeteria, I walk past some work areas where we have people making things. They probably have a fancy word for it, <em>fabrication</em> or some such. But it is cool. This one little work area I walk past, they have 4 or 5 pegboards full of some sort of little tool bits. I don&rsquo;t know what they are - they may be cutting bits or burning bits or something I&rsquo;ve never seen before. But there&rsquo;s hundreds of them, all hanging there neatly organized and ready to use. And there on the benches are pieces of plastic and metal that people are working on. Cutting, shaping, joining.</p>
<p>My job is much more abstract. I write software. That means I sit and type things into a computer, and trust the computer to translate those words into more abstract code. When you get down to it, this stuff is just little 0s and 1s encoded as magnetic fields on a computer disk. Then I go down to the lab, and squirt those little magnetic fields into a very expensive piece of computing equipment, which causes pictures to come up on a screen once we squirt some more data (electrical impulses) into the back of the equipment. It&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s complex. At times, it&rsquo;s very cool - we can accomplish very complicated things very quickly and efficiently. But at times, it feels a bit empty; there&rsquo;s nothing real solid I can point to at the end of the day and say &ldquo;I made that&rdquo;. The constant abstraction makes it that much more meaningful for me to walk the halls and see real things being made.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is about the way we&rsquo;re wired, but I, for one, occasionally need to see, feel, hold <em>real</em> stuff. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I&rsquo;m a big geek, I love technology, I could explain our flight displays to you from the processor and hardware all the way up through the application software, and every level in between. But there are times when I just need to get my hands on something real. We bought a new washing machine last night, and I need to build a pedestal for it. Maybe this weekend I can go out and do some building myself.</p>

			 <p>No, <a href="http://ijsm.org/archives/category/geekery/gtd/">Geof</a>, I haven&rsquo;t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/">the book</a>, and this isn&rsquo;t about the book. However, it has been nice lately to get some things done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the <a href="http://www.noelridge.org">Noelridge Park Church</a> website sitting incomplete for several months now. I just needed to get some photos taken, but had never gotten it done. I got the pictures taken and sent them in on Monday. Soon we will be updated and ready to go. Phew!</p>
<p>In addition, tonight I will be getting things scheduled such that I have the first of what will be regular weeks off from leading the worship team. I need the break. I&rsquo;m very thankful to the Lord for bringing in other musicians who can share the load.</p>
<p>There have been a bunch of other little things recently that haven&rsquo;t been big notable items, but just things that have been on the waiting list for a while and now are getting completed. It&rsquo;s a good feeling. It&rsquo;s also probably timely; come the beginning of March I&rsquo;ll have other things to keep me busy. :-)</p>

			 <p><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0441790348.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" alt="Stranger in a Strange Land">I was on the prowl for some sci-fi to read last time I was at the library. They are courteous enough to have the sci-fi genre split out into its own section, so browsing the shelves is a fairly straightforward means of finding some new sci-fi to read. (I will confess to scratching my head at the inclusion of the whole <em>Left Behind</em> series in the sci-fi section, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.) My browsing led me to Robert Heinlein&rsquo;s <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>, with cover boasting that it was &ldquo;original and un-cut for the first time&rdquo;. I skimmed the flyleaf and it seemed like I might possibly be interested in the story, so I borrowed the book and brought it home.</p>
<p><em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em> seemed to me to be two different stories, only tangentially related. The first story, nearly the first half of the book, concerns Michael, the Man from Mars; he is the child of two human Martian explorers. They died when he was a small child and then he was raised by Martians. As the story begins Michael has just returned to earth and must deal with an unfamiliar world filled with people looking to take advantage of him. It&rsquo;s a fairly imaginative fish-out-of-water story.</p>
<p>The second half of the book departs from this exploration into a treatise on the 1960&rsquo;s hippie ideals of uninhibited carnality, free love and open marriage. Michael (who possesses amazing cosmic powers, thanks to his understanding of the Martian language and Martian mind techniques) founds a &ldquo;church&rdquo; which is a multi-level scheme; novitiates are presented with a study of Martian and the mind techniques; it&rsquo;s not until they reached the highest levels of the organization that they were brought into the sexual free-for-all. In the end, they are persecuted, they scatter to spread their &ldquo;church&rdquo; abroad, and Michael *poofs* himself back to Mars.</p>
<p>I was ready to put down the book about halfway through the second section; the story takes a turn for the worse at that point. It appears to me that Mr. Heinlein wanted to write his hippie treatise, and found that it was easiest to do in the guise of other-worldly values. Enter enlightened Martians telling us that the answer to all our troubles is a lot of free sex and some cool cosmic powers&hellip; ugh. Oh well, on to the next book.</p>

			 <p>We had our first WT practice in about a month on Wednesday night. It was good to get back to it. I don&rsquo;t know what was up on Wednesday, whether I turned the monitors up higher than usual, or what, but we sounded <em>really good</em> vocally. Harmonies were tight. Everybody sounded nice and even and balanced. What a nice sound. I&rsquo;m looking forward to Sunday&hellip; hopefully we accomplish something similar then. Hate to leave your best stuff on the bullpen mound in warmups. But the glory goes to God either way.</p>
<p>One of the good things that&rsquo;s come out of <a href="/05/12/a-sick-weekend/">my sickness over Christmas</a> and <a href="/05/10/priorities-of-time/">my efforts to weed out my schedule</a> has been several people coming forward to help out with leading the worship team. For much of the six years I&rsquo;ve led the team, it&rsquo;s been hard to line someone up for just the occasional Sunday I had to be gone. (Just a few times a year!) But things are changing. One woman who has attended for a long while and has led worship other places in the past wanted to start participating. So we got her involved. Now the gal who volunteered at a moment&rsquo;s notice when I was sick back in December has indicated she&rsquo;d like to be available to fill in from time to time. And then earlier this week our bass player (a phenomenal all-around musician) said he&rsquo;d really like to lead some services and he could do that playing either the bass or the piano. Praise God for his supply!</p>
<p>I distributed a WT schedule for the next two months that includes me having one Sunday off each month and another Sunday where we are more informal and don&rsquo;t have a WT. (That was the pastor&rsquo;s idea, not mine&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t mind it.) We&rsquo;ll see how it plays out, but I think this is the start of some easing off of my WT load&hellip; and that will be very nice.</p>

We had an easy time with kiddo #1&hellip; we got to Laura and both went &ldquo;yeah, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;.

			 <p>Well I just about have this one finished up so I&rsquo;ll write about it now. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a>, in addition to having been for many years the conservative political columnist for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</a>, is also the author of the &ldquo;On Language&rdquo; column that ran in that paper on Sundays for many years. In &ldquo;On Language&rdquo;, Mr. Safire explored the origin of words and phrases, discusses usage and spelling, and generally addressed any other language-related topic that piqued his interest. <em>No Uncertain Terms</em> is a recent (perhaps the latest&hellip; I&rsquo;m not quite certain) collection of those &ldquo;On Language&rdquo; columns, one of at least a dozen. I know I own at least one more of the set: <em>In Love With Norma Loquendi</em>.</p>
<p>Being a lover of words and turns of phrase, Safire&rsquo;s columns fascinate me. ALmost better than the columns, though, are the responses he chooses to print. Many of his readers choose to write in, enough that he has given the various groups titles. There&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Gotcha! Gang&rdquo;, which nails him on factual errors. (I was actually a member of this gang once several years ago.) Then there&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Squad Squad&rdquo;, nailing redundancy at every turn. Safire often corresponds with professors of English, editors of dictionaries, and historians, which means that the level of learnedness is very high. Still, the writing is snappy, so the book stays fun, and rarely gets dull.</p>
<p>I doubt I&rsquo;ll find and add all of Safire&rsquo;s collections to my personal library, but I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for another volume or two. They are fun reading, the topics won&rsquo;t get old, <em>and</em> they improve my grammar and usage.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting at work today, but with some Christmas gifts to entertain me; right now I&rsquo;m listening to (and quite enjoying) <a href="http://www.jamiecullum.com">Jamie Cullum</a>&rsquo;s new album <em>Catching Tales</em>. It&rsquo;s a nice mix of jazz and pop, very listenable.

(Quick solution: rip the files with <a href="http://www.download.com/CDex/3000-2140_4-10226370.html?tag=pdp_prod">CDex</a>, then import them into iTunes.)</p>
<p>Finally, the last bit of fun for now: Becky IM&rsquo;d me from home a little while ago to let me know that my copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0/Premiere Elements 2.0 came from Amazon today. Oh, the fun I will have photo and video editing&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m already a day late on this - it&rsquo;s January 2nd, not the first. I&rsquo;ll probably come up a (metaphorical) dollar short, too&hellip; you won&rsquo;t find any deep New Year&rsquo;s resolutions here. Somehow I&rsquo;ve never been much for New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. Not that I&rsquo;m against them - I just never put too much effort into them. This year is no different.</p>
<p>I could write a lot about the year gone by, but if you want to read about it I have blog archives that cover the year. :-) I could write about the year upcoming, but seeing as I lack the ability to see the future, my predictions will be at best haphazard in accuracy. Much will change; much will remain the same. I don&rsquo;t want to sound too nonchalant about my life, but in a sense, I am; I am confident that the God who has directed and guided me through my first 28 years will continue to guide me through my 29th. He will continue to provide the conviction that drives change; blessedly, He is also the provider of the ability to make that change.</p>
<p>So welcome to the year of our Lord 2006. May He bless you richly this year as He continues His good work in you.</p>

			 <p><em>Powersat</em> is one of the latest titles by long-time sci-fi author <a href="http://www.benbova.com">Ben Bova</a>. Bova is a prolific author. His numerous tomes are full of futuristic technology, but the technology never takes the forefront; rather, it just provides the setting for classic themes of exploration, ambition, love, and revenge. <em>Powersat</em> is no exception.</p>
<p>Powersat is set in the near future, and features an inventor who is trying to set up a geosynchronous satellite that will collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via &ldquo;widely dispersed&rdquo; microwaves. The worldwide oil syndicates, worried that the demand for oil might be decreased, sabotage his efforts, and the conflict ensues. The hero, trying to identify the villians and stop them; the villians, trying to continue to stay under the radar while continuing their sabotage.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of suprises in <em>Powersat</em>. The characters do about what you&rsquo;d expect, and the hero is successful as you would expect. Mr. Bova is pushing his favorable views of space exploration and invention here, with a story that, if not superb, is certainly at least sufficient to carry the message. Still, it was a distracting, lightweight read, another enjoyable book from Ben Bova.</p>

			 <p>OK, so when we bought our 40-hour Tivo, it was small-ish for storage space, but it worked. Now that we&rsquo;ve got subscriptions going for kids programming like Sesame Street and Zooboomafoo, I&rsquo;ve been wishing for some more storage space. Having been assured by <a href="http://www.virtualsmiley.net">Mark</a> that the upgrade was fairly easy, I decided to take it on myself.</p>
<p>Step 1 was to get a larger hard drive. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot, but I wanted a lot of space. A Christmas gift card to Best Buy (thanks <a href="http://thehubbs.net/ryan/">Ryan</a>!) was a good starting point. Then I found a good deal on a <a href="https://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/menuitem.fdd9dbceef73222d92b86b31bac4f0a0/">Hitachi Deskstar 7K250 160 GB hard drive</a>. It started at $119.99, but has $80 worth of mail-in rebates. So I picked it up today and got started.</p>
<p>There are good instructions out on the web for upgrading to a bigger Tivo hard drive. The most detailed and useful was <a href="http://www.newreleasesvideo.com/hinsdale-how-to/index9.html">www.newreleasesvideo.com/hinsdale-how-to/index9.html</a>. It has very specific step-by-step instructions.</p>
<p>Step 2 was to crack open the Tivo and backup its hard drive onto the new hard drive. Most of the time here was spent just opening cases and swapping in and out hard drives. Per the instructions I had created a bootable CD running some specialized Linux, and that allowed me to do all of the fun backups and restores.</p>
<p>The whole copying process (including all of the programs I currently have recorded) took about 2 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Step 3: put everything back together and check out the system status page.  The results: 40 or so hours of recording space in &ldquo;Best&rdquo; mode, up to 183 hours in &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; mode.  I think I&rsquo;ll stick in &ldquo;High&rdquo; mode, which&rsquo;ll give me 83 hours of recording time.</p>
<p>Note: depending on the type of Tivo, you may not be able to use all the hard drive space; older Tivos software limits you to addressing about 137 GB. However, my Series 2 Tivo model TVD540040 is able to address larger amounts, so I was able to use all 160 GB. Woohoo!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll echo Mark&rsquo;s comments here on Tivo upgrades; I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was. If you&rsquo;re comfortable swapping hard drives in and out and setting the master/slave jumpers, you can do this. No problemo.</p>

			 <p>OK, so Christmas was actually two days ago. Now the family has all left for their respective homes and our house is quiet. It was a very nice Christmas. Laura is old enough this year to understand about opening presents and to really enjoy the toys she got. She could&rsquo;ve just stopped with the first one&hellip; after 7 or 8 she was overwhelmed. We ended up leaving the last few of hers for her to open later.</p>
<p>I received many thoughtful gifts this year. In no particular order&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Jamie Cullum&rsquo;s new CD, Chasing Tales</li>
<li>Duke Ellington&rsquo;s 70th Birthday CD</li>
<li>A cool t-shirt from Target - a spoof of the famous &ldquo;Dogs at Cards&rdquo;, but with Snoopy and his pals playing poker. Actually, I got two of these.</li>
<li>Two Family Christian Stores gift cards - the first will buy me <a href="http://www.derekwebb.com">Derek Webb'</a>s <em>Mockingbird</em>, dunno what I&rsquo;ll get with the rest.</li>
<li>Lemstone bookstore gift certificate</li>
<li>Best Buy gift card</li>
<li>Burger King gift card&hellip;. mmmmmm&hellip;. Whoppers.</li>
<li>Some gift fundage from Becky&rsquo;s folks&hellip; I&rsquo;m using this to buy the Adobe Photoshop Elements/Premiere Elements bundle pack I&rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while.</li>
<li>A bunch of misc sundries</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s it. My apologies to anybody if I forgot their gift.</p>
<p>Now I have the rest of the week off from work, so I&rsquo;ll have to find some projects to work on. Somehow I think I&rsquo;d go crazy if I did nothing but sit and play on the computer all week. It wouldn&rsquo;t score many points with Becky, either. :-) So, I&rsquo;m off now. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!</p>

			 <p>My today didn&rsquo;t go as planned. But that&rsquo;s OK - it&rsquo;s turned out just fine anyhow. Becky showed up on IM at 7:30 this morning (waaaay early for her) and said she was feeling poorly. It ends up she&rsquo;s got this one-day stomach bug that a bunch of folks around here have had; throwing up and the whole works. So I left work about 8 to come home and take care of Laura.</p>
<p>Laura and I played and stuff in the morning, then she took a nap. This afternoon, we went down to Coral Ridge Mall to get out of the house and so I could start finish my Christmas shopping. I managed to pick up stuff for everybody except Becky. Laura was very good, enjoyed walking at the mall, didn&rsquo;t fuss much.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s evening, and instead of going to the coffeehouse as we had planned, we&rsquo;re sitting here at home watching Northern Iowa play for the D I-AA football championship. Actually, to be fair, Becky told me to go ahead and go to the coffeehouse if I wanted to, but I decided I felt like staying home instead. And now, I think I&rsquo;m the only one watching the football game&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s fallen asleep here on the couch.</p>
<p>Such is the exciting Friday night of this old married guy&hellip;</p>

			 <p><a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2005/12/14/andrew-peterson-and-friends-at-the-ryman/">All the recent posts</a> <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/katie/2005/12/15/mandatory-nashville-post/">about the AP Christmas concert</a> <a href="http://imperfectmirror.org/2005/12/13/christmas-traditions/">at the Ryman last weekend</a> reminded me of one little amusing thing that I had heretofore failed to relate. It happened during the AP Christmas concert in Cedar Rapids a few weeks ago, which I have written several posts about already.</p>
<p>As AP and crew were coming back from intermission to start the second half of the concert, Andrew came up to the microphone with his guitar and led the audience in a verse of the hymn <em>Nothing But the Blood of Jesus</em>. He used the guitar only long enough to get everyone started on key, then he stopped playing. Ben Shive, keyboard guru to the stars and really nice guy, was still playing keyboards as we sang.</p>
<p>When we hit the chorus of the hymn (&ldquo;O precious is the flow&hellip;&quot;), Ben went to play some funky chord instead of the standard I (one) chord. Now, I can understand that&hellip; the hymn is pretty boring, harmonically. I, IV, V, that&rsquo;s about it. It&rsquo;s definitely ready for some spicing up. The problem for Ben was, there were 700 people singing along, and singing in full standard harmony. When he hit that chord, Andrew looked back at him with raised eyebrows as if to say &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s not gonna work&hellip;&rdquo; and Ben responded with an amused look of his own, and switched back to standard harmonization.</p>
<p>I realize at this point that I may be the only one ever to read this who would&rsquo;ve been amused by this situation. But it&rsquo;s <strong>my</strong> blog, so I can write about whatever amuses me. :-) So, word to Ben: keep up the funky harmonies, man. I would&rsquo;ve (and have, many times) done the same thing. Or, next time, you can just let everybody sing a capella. :-)</p>

			 <p>Monday afternoon found me traveling to Wichita, KS, for my DER interview with the FAA. The wisdom that is American Airlines decided that the best way for me to get from Cedar Rapids to Wichita was via Dallas-Fort Worth. Hey, at least it gave me lots of time to cram on the plane. None the less, I made it to Wichita around 7 PM, got my rental car, and found my way around.</p>
<p>The interview was Tuesday morning, and wasn&rsquo;t nearly as brutal as I had feared and been warned. It lasted a whole 30 minutes. It went very well. Then I had a couple of hours to kill before my flight back to CR. Fortunately, I was able to locate a Borders bookstore which allowed me to easily kill my time, and at the same time pick up a couple things for Becky and Laura. OK, so I picked up something for me, too - Johnny Cash&rsquo;s <em>The Man Comes Around</em> CD. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I was scheduled to have a 4-hour layover at Chicago O&rsquo;Hare on my trip back. Happily, though, I was able to catch a standby seat on a flight 3 hours early, which got me home closer to 4 PM than 7 PM. It was also a nice suprise to walk up to my departure gate and see my friend Steve sitting there waiting for the same flight! He had been in Vegas on business for a week, and just happened to be booked on that flight. We didn&rsquo;t get adjoining seats on the flight, but it was fun to be able to chat at O&rsquo;Hare and then when we got back to CID.</p>
<p>My only gripe of the trip was the little bitty regional jets that we flew in on each leg of the flight; one of those little Embraer jobs that has 3 seats across. Too small. You have to duck just to get in. One of these days I&rsquo;ll fly somewhere in something big enough that I can stand up straight in the aisle. :-)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been feeling like Christmas the last couple of weeks, what with the sub-zero temps and the foot of snow we&rsquo;ve gotten over the last 10 days. Tonight we got the Christmas tree put up. We&rsquo;ve actually had it since Tuesday, but finally had a chance today to get it decorated and lit up. Actually, in this picture, it&rsquo;s only about half-done - Becky&rsquo;s still working on the tinsel, and we still have a mess of needles to clean up on the floor.</p>

<p>The excitement that went along with it was Laura throwing up twice. Hopefully it was just something she ate and not the stomach flu that&rsquo;s going around&hellip; :-(</p>
<p>Tomorrow I head off to Wichita for my DER interview. If you think about it, say a prayer for me&hellip; the interview&rsquo;s at 9 AM on Tuesday. I&rsquo;ll let you all know how I did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the news from the Hubbs' world, where the women are strong, the women are good-looking, and the child is definitely above average. :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://www.gfmorris.net">Geof Morris</a> once referred to him as &ldquo;Andy &lsquo;It&rsquo;s really sad that the only thing that the only song of mine that the .net knows is that silly <em>Roast Beef</em> song I did&rsquo; Gullahorn&rdquo;. And up until Saturday, that was pretty much all I knew of him.</p>
<p>(In case you&rsquo;re wondering, <em>Roast Beef</em> is a silly song Andy wrote about <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2005/05/14/this-little-piggy/">Andy Osenga&rsquo;s missing (amputated) toe</a>. It <em>is</em> pretty funny.)</p>
<p>Last Saturday I had the privilege of meeting Andy Gullahorn when he came as part of the <em>Behold the Lamb</em> Christmas tour to Cedar Rapids. My first impressions were these:</p>
<ol>
<li>He&rsquo;s tall. Almost as tall as me. That sounds like a funny observation, but compared to the other guys on the tour, who are mostly all short, Andy seems like a giant.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s a heck of a guitar player.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I got to hear him in concert, and I discovered two more things:</p>
<ol>
<li>He&rsquo;s really funny.</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s a heck of a songwriter, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first song he did was a little piece of satire entitled <em>Holy Flakes</em>. It had the place laughing through the first two verses, and then suddenly quiet when the third verse revealed the moral of the story. I was thrilled. I can&rsquo;t think of the last time I&rsquo;ve heard a song so funny and yet so pointed at the same time. The second song he sang was <em>Freedom</em>. It&rsquo;s a more serious piece, but a masterful bit of songwriting.</p>
<p>When the concert was over, I beat a quick path to the CD table, and purchased both of Andy&rsquo;s CDs. (My purchasing choices were made a bit easier by the fact that I owned nearly every other CD they had for sale that night.) I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve listened to anything else since Saturday night. The songs are spare, not a lot of fancy production or instrumentation, but the lyrical content is right on. A song like <em>Beginning of the End</em> resonates with me in ways I find hard to describe.</p>
<p>Last Saturday provided me with many wonderful opportunities. But near the top of that list was the chance to become familiar with Andy Gullahorn. You may now count me as a big fan. Oh, and if you get the chance, go visit <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">his website</a>. You will see the humor shining through. :-)</p>

<p>I met the Queen of Iowa, She was dying on a couch in the suburbs. And of all the things she was dying of, She was more alive than the others&hellip;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
-- Andrew Peterson, <em>The Queen of Iowa</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Queen of Iowa is a real person. I met her this past Saturday. Her name is Jody. Her story is tragic; she contracted HIV after being assaulted fifteen years ago. Her story is also beautiful; knowing full well that she had HIV, her high school sweetheart decided to marry her anyway. That was eleven years ago. Jody is now in what appears to me to be the last stage of her life. She can&rsquo;t move. She can&rsquo;t talk. She can just barely communicate single letters at a time. Her husband cares for her at their home here in the Cedar Rapids area.</p>
<p>It also ends up that Jody is a big <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> fan. Over a year ago, as she started going downhill, a couple of friends arranged to have Andrew and his trusty sidekick Ben Shive flown to Iowa to meet her. They came, visited, sang her some songs. Out of that experience, Andrew wrote his song <em><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=56">The Queen of Iowa</a></em>, which he then recorded on his latest album, <em>The Far Country</em>. It&rsquo;s a good song.</p>
<p>Last Saturday Andrew was in town with a bunch of his musical compatriots on the <em>Behold the Lamb</em> Christmas tour. In the afternoon, before the concert, he wanted to make a trip out to visit Jody again and sing her the song. So I (as the driver) got to go along as he and his friends <a href="http://www.andygullahorn.com">Andy</a> and <a href="http://www.jillphillips.com">Jill (Phillips)</a> Gullahorn went out to visit her. (The local friends who had coordinated last year&rsquo;s visit were there, too.) I was not prepared, and I doubt I could have really been prepared, for the emotions and power of that visit.</p>
<p>To even enter their house, you have to take off your shoes and leave them in the garage. (Can&rsquo;t chance tracking some germs in.) Then, you have to do a thorough hand-washing before you come into the living room. Jody was lying on the couch, wrapped in blankets. She couldn&rsquo;t really move, only could turn her head a bit. But she had a smile that lit up the whole room. She was so excited to get to see Andrew again and hear his music. She had made a &ldquo;set list&rdquo; of requested songs she wanted to hear. So Andrew and Andy pulled out their guitars, and started at the top of the list.</p>
<p>I think they sang for somewhere near 40 minutes. They started with <em><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=42">Gather &lsquo;Round, Ye Children, Come</a></em> from <em>Behold the Lamb</em>. It was a treat to hear that simple version: two guitars and three part harmony, all in the intimacy of a living room. Jill sang <em><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=49">Labor of Love</a></em>, also from <em>Behold the Lamb</em>. I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever hear a more beautiful performance of that song. Words can&rsquo;t really do it justice. Jill sang another song or two of hers. We were all choking up as Andrew sang <em><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=55">Lay Me Down</a></em>, which contains these poignant lines, even more meaningful in this setting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you lay me down to die, I&rsquo;ll miss my boys, I&rsquo;ll miss my girls, But lay me down And let me say goodbye to this world. When you lay me down to die, You must remember this: When you lay me down to die, You lay me down to live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were a few times during the visit where Jody began to cough, and her body was just wracked with pain. It was difficult to sit there and see it, knowing that there was nothing that we could do but pray and watch as her husband held her and comforted her. Then the pain would pass, and as she regained her strength her smile would come out again.</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s visit was a moving experience; one that will stick with me for a long, long time. We insulate ourselves too much from pain and death here in America. Last Saturday&rsquo;s visit was a vivid reminder of that to which I assent but often forget: that life is short, that death will reach us all, but death is not the end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Parting is the price, it is the price that I must pay To harbor far beyond the Havens Grey.</p>
<p>-- Andrew Peterson, <em><a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/lyrics.php?id=58">The Havens Grey</a></em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So Saturday night was the Behold the Lamb concert in Cedar Rapids. As you know if you read my previous post, I was the runner for the day. And what a day it was. There are so many aspects I want to write about that they&rsquo;d make for one absurdly long and multi-faceted blog post. So, I&rsquo;ll try to split it up a bit.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. I showed up at Kennedy HS about 10:15 Saturday morning to help unload. Pretty much all the gear had been carried in from the bus, but the sound guys were just starting to unload. There were a bunch of people to help unload, though, so it went relatively quickly.</p>
<p>My first run of the day was pretty simple; I took the bus driver (I think his name is Perry?) and Chris Biggs (the sound guy/road manager for the tour) over to the hotel to get everybody checked in. Then the next trip to the hotel was Andy and Jill (Phillips) Gullahorn. Then there was a trip with Andy Peterson, Andy Osenga, Garrett Buell, and Cason Cooley. Then there was a trip with Derek and Sandra (McCracken) Webb. Ben Shive was in there somewhere, too. OK, so I&rsquo;m name-dropping out the wazoo here. It was just a treat to get to meet all of them and chat a bit.</p>
<p>Later on in the afternoon, as the snow started falling (we got 4 inches of snow that afternoon&hellip; fun times driving), I got to drive and go along with Andy P, Andy G, and Jill as they visited the woman who was the inspiration for AP&rsquo;s song <em>The Queen of Iowa</em>. It was a powerful time. I&rsquo;ll write a separate post later.</p>
<p>I thought that perhaps by the time we got to the actual concert, it would be anti-climactic. Boy was I wrong. The first half of the concert was time for solo songs. They sang:</p>
<p>Andy O - <em>If I Had Wings</em>, <em>Early in the Morning</em> Andy P - <em>The Queen of Iowa</em>, <em>Let There Be Light</em> Andy G - <em>Holy Flakes</em>, <em>Freedom</em> Derek - <em>A New Law</em>, <em>Lover</em> Jill - I feel horrible about this, but I can&rsquo;t remember which songs she sang. One of &lsquo;em was &ldquo;so new I haven&rsquo;t learned the guitar part yet&rdquo;, so Andy G played it for her. Sandra - <em>Where I&rsquo;m From</em>, and I don&rsquo;t remember the other one</p>
<p>During one of the car trips, Jill noted that one of the things she thought was so cool about this tour was hearing how even though they had many of the same musical influences, each of their songwriting styles is still distinct and plays out just a bit differently. That was quite clear at the concert, hearing these songs. I&rsquo;ll write more about them later, too.</p>
<p>So let me wrap this post up. After the show was over, I helped load stuff up, picked up the bus driver from his day&rsquo;s sleep at the hotel, and somewhere in there managed to get almost everybody to sign a concert poster which now hangs on my cube wall at work, right next to the Share the Well tour poster that I got signed at a concert last year. They will continue to bring back memories of great days and concerts.</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow the Andrew Peterson Behold the Lamb Christmas tour is hitting Cedar Rapids! I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when I first heard about it months ago, and I&rsquo;m still a bit in awe of the fact that Andrew Peterson, Derek Webb, Sandra McCracken, Andrew Osenga, Jill Phillips, and some others will all be in concert on stage less than 3 miles from my house. (Only 1 block away from the previous place we lived!)</p>
<p>In addition to just going to the concert, I&rsquo;ve volunteered to help out for the day. I&rsquo;m showing up at 10 AM when the truck shows up, and then will be the &ldquo;runner&rdquo; for the day. This will include taking all the aforementioned musical types to their hotel, to the house where they&rsquo;re eating dinner, etc. I think it&rsquo;ll be pretty cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to just getting to meet some of them; I&rsquo;ve met the Andys before (Peterson and Osenga), but haven&rsquo;t met Derek or Sandra. I hope it&rsquo;ll be as cool as I think it will be&hellip;. if not, at least I&rsquo;ll get to see the concert, and that&rsquo;ll be great in itself. I&rsquo;ll try to post some pictures or something next week.</p>

			 <p>Well, so I still haven&rsquo;t received the official &ldquo;you&rsquo;re invited for an interview&rdquo; letter from the FAA. However, I got a phone call yesterday from them, wanting to schedule my DER interview. It&rsquo;s gonna be in Wichita on December 13th at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>I guess I should start studying up for the interview. I don&rsquo;t know how much they&rsquo;re gonna expect me to know, and how much it&rsquo;s just a chance to have them get a feel for me. Hopefully more of the latter than the former. :-)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been reading several different books recently, and a discussion with Becky last night brought a bunch of them together in a way that helped clarify my thoughts a bit. Hopefully I can bring some of that clarity into this post.</p>
<p>As a person who grew up within the church and has been a believer for as long as I can remember, one of the things that&rsquo;s been most difficult for me to understand is this: why would a non-believer be motivated to become a Christian? What&rsquo;s the appeal? Now, you Calvinists out there will tell me that God has ordained it and its irresistible. I don&rsquo;t want to get into that argument. I don&rsquo;t disagree with you&hellip; much. But I&rsquo;ve just never understood the appeal of the message to non-believers who are living basic, normal lives.</p>
<p>Last night Becky and I were talking over the passage from Acts that had been part of our reading for the day. (I don&rsquo;t want that to sound too much like we&rsquo;ve got it all together - we&rsquo;re trying once again to get daily devotions started, and it&rsquo;s tough, as always.) Becky&rsquo;s comment on Peter&rsquo;s sermon in Acts 2 was that it sounded wild, far-out, hard-to-believe&hellip; why would anybody be attracted to that story? It is a good question. Why would anybody be attracted to the story of a man who claimed to come from God, be God himself, who died, purportedly rose from the dead, etc? <em>Qui bono</em>? Who benefits?</p>
<p>That got me started thinking through some of the C. S. Lewis I&rsquo;ve been reading lately. Actually, I&rsquo;m reading <em>The Question of God: C.S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life</em> by Armand M. Nicholi Jr. This Harvard professor compares and contrasts the lives and teachings of C. S. Lewis and Sigmund Freud. It&rsquo;s a good book, especially for those seekers who want to reason through the issues. Mostly it whets my appetite to go back and read Lewis again, <em>Mere Christianity</em>, <em>The Abolition of Man</em>, <em>God in the Dock</em>&hellip; good stuff. Anyway, back to my thought process.</p>
<p>Readers of <em>Mere Christianity</em> will remember that Lewis' starting point for reasoning that there is a God is an argument from conscience; he argues that each of us has an inborn moral compass that understands that there is a moral standard. Right along with that is the fact that each of us transgresses that moral standard on a regular basis, which causes us problems with our fellow man and internal guilt.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the appeal of the gospel message? I&rsquo;m starting to think that I&rsquo;d start it off like this: &ldquo;Things aren&rsquo;t right.&rdquo; I think that&rsquo;s a place we can all agree on to start. Things aren&rsquo;t right in the world, and things aren&rsquo;t right with me personally. This causes pain, grief, guilt, death. Now let&rsquo;s look at the grand sweep of the redemptive story that runs from Genesis to Revelation. God creates everything. Man corrupts it. Things aren&rsquo;t right. Now here&rsquo;s the beauty of the message: <em>the whole rest of the story is about God&rsquo;s work to make things right again.</em> That is the message of the gospel.</p>
<p>Once we understand that, then we can get into details. Sin requires a sacrifice. Jesus once for all became that sacrifice in our place, and then conquered death by rising from the dead. One day He will establish a perfect kingdom, one where sin is done away with and things are right.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a story I can get excited about. And I can understand why <em>that</em> story would resonate with the unbelieving world. We all understand things aren&rsquo;t right. May God allow those unbelievers around us to to understand that He holds the solution to the problem.</p>

			 <p>This holiday weekend we have left Iowa and headed to Wisconsin to visit my family. Thanksgiving with family is a great time; we have all of our traditional things to eat, games that we play, stories that get (re)told, time spent together. It is a blessing.</p>
<p>Last year when we came for Thanksgiving, Laura was just a 4-month-old baby. Now she&rsquo;s walking, talking, and generally the center of all our attention. Amazing.</p>
<p>The rest of the family is doing well, too. <a href="http://thehubbs.net/ryan/">Ryan</a> generally works long hours and is very busy, which means that when he comes home he sleeps a <em>lot</em>. It&rsquo;s good for him. He&rsquo;s so darn funny, too&hellip; he keeps us in stitches most of the time. Last night as we were playing cards he made some slightly off-color comment; then he excused himself by noting that he has roomed with guys for the past several years, and, he said &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t just push the envelope - the envelope is opened, soiled, and returned to sender!&rdquo; OK, maybe it&rsquo;s not so funny in print, but last night we about had to stop our card game we were laughing so hard.</p>
<p>Aaron is the only one that isn&rsquo;t here; he&rsquo;s still in Panama working with YWAM. We miss him a lot. He called yesterday for about an hour so we all got to talk to him. He&rsquo;ll be back home for Christmas - hooray! It also sounds like he&rsquo;s planning on moving back to the States come next summer. It would be great to have him closer again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to head in to Madison to do some shopping. I know, we&rsquo;re crazy, but we all start to go a bit stir-crazy after being here at the house for a day and a half, so it&rsquo;s time to go out. Andrew had to work this morning at the lumberyard, but he&rsquo;ll meet us there once he gets off around noon. I doubt we&rsquo;ll even buy that much - maybe a new shirt, or a CD, or something in that vein. Mostly it&rsquo;s the chance to be out and around as a family. Holidays like this remind me that my family is the biggest blessing of all.</p>

			 <p>I got a letter from the FAA today inviting me to the DER seminar down in Wichita in January. Strangely enough, I still haven&rsquo;t received a letter from them telling me that I&rsquo;ve been accepted to come for an interview to become a DER. I&rsquo;m hoping maybe that&rsquo;ll come yet this week some time. Exciting times! Now I&rsquo;ll have to get my books out and study some more for the interview. Gotta learn the alphabet soup that is our federal aviation regulations. :-)</p>

			 <p>My first basketball league of the season starts tonight. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it. I know my shooting touch will be rusty; I haven&rsquo;t handled a basketball in months. But it will be good to get out there and run. I&rsquo;m the captain of a team in the rec center league this year. I tried to just get on a team at the last minute; the league coordinator sent me the names of several other people with the same plight and so we formed a team. I haven&rsquo;t met any of them. We haven&rsquo;t practiced. But tonight, at 5:55 CST, we will step onto the court and play our first game. Good times.</p>

			 <p>&hellip;and I had been planning on doing yard work. I did a little bit this morning (ran the mower on the front yard and filled up five and a half yard bags with leaves and such) but then it got nasty outside and Becky had a church event so I got to watch the kiddo for a while.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s not so nice to work outside (and since Becky has my long extension cord at church, so I can&rsquo;t run the leaf blower), and since Laura is taking a nice nap, I decided it was a nice time to give the blog a facelift and watch football. So, Clemson is on TV beating Florida State, and I&rsquo;m on the couch with the laptop working on the blog. Actually, it&rsquo;s about done for now.</p>
<p>I like lots of things about this theme. I think it&rsquo;s a big improvement over the old one. It was created by <a href="http://clemens.orth.me.uk/">Clemens Orth</a>, found by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, and tweaked by me. The only thing I&rsquo;m not totally happy with at the moment is the font on the header graphic&hellip; it could be better. Maybe when I have some more time to be patient with photoshop, I&rsquo;ll give it another try.</p>

			 <p>I am a voracious reader of fiction. I read a good bit of non-fiction, too, but fictional thrillers and sci-fi are my chance to escape for a while, so on any of my regular trips to the library you will find my stack of books weighted towards those genres. I was really in the mood for some sci-fi on this last trip, and while browsing the sci-fi shelves at the local library, I remembered <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2005/10/18/walking-in-salem/">a mention that Andy Osenga had made</a> a while back about Orson Scott Card&rsquo;s <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em>. I figured it was worth a try, and so I picked up the (paperback!) book and added it to my stack. When I got home, I didn&rsquo;t start it first; I had one book that was a 10-day reserve that I wanted to get out of the way. (Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s <em>The World is Flat</em>, if you really care.) But before long it was getting dry and so I turned to Card.</p>
<p>Let me just get it out of the way early: <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> is a terrific book. The story is well-told. The main characters are exceptional children who, for the most part, sound like adults. Their childish emotional states, though, are crucial to the story. Card puts you right there, feeling what the hero feels. I had a hard time putting the book down. The twist at the end is just brilliant. I didn&rsquo;t see it coming, but it made perfect sense given what you have been told in the story to that point. And when you find out, it&rsquo;s one of those &ldquo;wow&rdquo; moments that sets your mind whirling.</p>
<p>I can understand why they classify <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> as sci-fi; the story is set in the future, with appropriately futuristic technologies and surroundings. But unlike much other science fiction, where the futuristic technology or science is at the core of the plot, <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> just uses the future as a tool to set up a story that resonates in any age. I also found interesting the device of using a main character who is a highly-intelligent child who sounds pretty much like an adult. It&rsquo;s not a common device; the only other place I remember reading a story from that perspective is Bryce Courtenay&rsquo;s much longer and more anguished <em>The Power of One</em>. But it works here. It causes you to identify with a protagonist that might otherwise be distant. And that makes the story work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking quite a bit about the story since I finished the book. The reluctant hero, the adults who keep him in the dark the whole time, the whole issue of the sacrifice of the unwitting to save the many; these are themes that will keep the book relevant for decades to come.</p>
<p>Pick up <em>Ender&rsquo;s Game</em> sometime if you haven&rsquo;t read it. It&rsquo;s worth your time. I hear they&rsquo;re talking of making a movie of it eventually; this is one of those stories where if the movie is done well, it could be a masterpiece. If it&rsquo;s done poorly, yick, what a waste. I&rsquo;ll hope for the former.</p>

			 <p>Last night we had a neighborhood potluck dinner, organized by our next-door neighbors. It was a bit chilly outside, but fun to go to something like this where you only have to walk five houses down to get there.</p>
<p>I like the idea of community in the neighborhood. I&rsquo;m not very good at it, though. Mostly, I&rsquo;m just not so good at being sociable. Let me clarify. It&rsquo;s easy for me to be sociable around folks I already know, and it&rsquo;s easy for me to carry on a conversation with people who are driving the conversation, but stick me with somebody as quiet as I am, and it gets uncomfortable pretty quickly. I&rsquo;m still learning how to ask the right questions, stuff like that. But over all, it went OK last night. The folks are friendly.</p>
<p>My other observation about the neighborhood folks, though: they&rsquo;re old. With the exception of our next-door neighbors, who are in their mid-40&rsquo;s, everybody else there was retired. Many of them long-retired. One of them was telling me that he was recovering from a stroke, and then about his son (or was it a nephew?) that was also recovering from a stroke. &ldquo;He was really young, too&hellip;&rdquo; the guy told me; &ldquo;only 60!&rdquo; I felt very young right about then.</p>
<p>After about 90 minutes and far too much food, everybody wandered off back to their own homes. Laura held my hand and walked all the way back home by herself. She was pretty tired when she got back. But I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be long until she&rsquo;s running the whole way ahead of me. Now <em>that</em> makes me feel old.</p>

			 <p>Peggy Noonan writes a <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110007460">somber column</a> today. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there is an unspoken subtext in our national political culture right now. In fact I think it&rsquo;s a subtext to our society. I think that a lot of people are carrying around in their heads, unarticulated and even in some cases unnoticed, a sense that the wheels are coming off the trolley and the trolley off the tracks. That in some deep and fundamental way things have broken down and can&rsquo;t be fixed, or won&rsquo;t be fixed any time soon. That our pollsters are preoccupied with &ldquo;right track&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong track&rdquo; but missing the number of people who think the answer to &ldquo;How are things going in America?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Off the tracks and hurtling forward, toward an unknown destination.&rdquo;<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;Plamegate.&rdquo; As I write no indictments have come up. I&rsquo;m not talking about &ldquo;Miers.&rdquo; I mean . . . the whole ball of wax. Everything. Cloning, nuts with nukes, epidemics; the growing knowledge that there&rsquo;s no such thing as homeland security; the fact that we&rsquo;re leaving our kids with a bill no one can pay. A sense of unreality in our courts so deep that they think they can seize grandma&rsquo;s house to build a strip mall; our media institutions imploding&ndash;the spectacle of a great American newspaper, the New York Times, hurtling off its own tracks, as did CBS. The fear of parents that their children will wind up disturbed, and their souls actually imperiled, by the popular culture in which we are raising them. Senators who seem owned by someone, actually owned, by an interest group or a financial entity. Great churches that have lost all sense of mission, and all authority. Do you have confidence in the CIA? The FBI? I didn&rsquo;t think so.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But this recounting doesn&rsquo;t quite get me to what I mean. I mean I believe there&rsquo;s a general and amorphous sense that things are broken and tough history is coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She uses the rest of the column to note that the &ldquo;elites&rdquo; who ought to be leading us out of this have instead made &ldquo;a separate peace&rdquo; and, rather than lead, have resigned themselves to doing what they want to do and just letting the thing derail.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading the piece just for its thought-provoking capacity. But then step back, take a deep breath, and give thanks for a Heavenly Father who is sovereign over all these events.</p>

			 <p>Last week Becky and I were able to leave Laura with my folks and take a couple days of vacation up to Door County, Wisconsin. We&rsquo;d never been there before, but had heard that the scenery was terrific. We weren&rsquo;t disappointed. We knew it was going to be dicey as to whether the leaves would still be on the trees at that date, (hey, we&rsquo;re cheap, we didn&rsquo;t want to pay peak-season rates for the hotel) but we figured it was worth a try.</p>
<p>Simply put, the scenery was magnificent. We drove down more little roads that were covered by archways of red and gold than I can recall to count. The weather was beautiful, even on the last day when it was raining. We had a very refreshing time, relaxing and taking in all the little towns: Egg Harbor, Fish Creek, Sister Bay, Bailey&rsquo;s Harbor, and some little places whose names have slipped my mind by now.</p>
<p>Friday night we ate at a <a href="http://www.missiongrille.com">restaurant</a> that had live jazz all evening. Saturday morning we had pecan rolls at a bakery/restaurant that were &ldquo;hailed as the best pecan rolls in Wisconsin&rdquo;. They weren&rsquo;t kidding. Door County has no chain restaurants or hotels any place north of Sturgeon Bay. It was refreshing to be able to choose between a bunch of unique cafes, restaurants, and supper clubs, rather than asking myself &ldquo;so is it Subway, McDonalds, or Applebees tonight?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two establishments particularly caught my eye on the trip; sadly, I only got a picture of one of them: The Pudgy Seagull Restaurant. (I&rsquo;ll post the picture ASAP.) The other was for somebody&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ho-Made&rdquo; bakery items. For that special personal touch in baking&hellip; OK, I won&rsquo;t go there.</p>
<p>So it was a great weekend. It was no fun to wake up this morning and realize it was Monday and that meant I had to go back to work&hellip;. but it was at least nice to be well-rested while doing it. :-)</p>

			 <p>I wrestled in an <a href="/05/09/the-present-future-and-associated-thoughts/">earlier post</a> with issues of time and busyness. I&rsquo;m still wrestling with it. I think I&rsquo;m making progress this time&hellip; maybe. Becky and I have talked about things quite a lot. She&rsquo;s supportive (no suprise there) of my desires to get the schedule cleaned off and getting my time priorities changed, and she&rsquo;ll help keep reminding me so that I don&rsquo;t just forget about it after a while and drift back to the same old way of doing things.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;ideal situation&rdquo; right now is still what I mentioned before: I&rsquo;d like to just dump <em>everything</em> church-related for a while and see how my schedule settles out. Then I could slowly put it back together the right way, and see how much time I have to do church-related things.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate here that I&rsquo;m not trying to get out of church responsibilities; I just need to act on what I&rsquo;ve recognized: that the church can make do without me for a while, but my family can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my &ldquo;ideal situation&rdquo; is going to happen - it&rsquo;s just not fair to everybody at church. I think there&rsquo;d be too many hard feelings and misunderstandings to make it comfortable to continue attending if I just totally dropped my responsibilities there. So I need to find a tolerable compromise. One has suggested itself here recently that just might work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn all my responsibilities for video and sound over to someone else. I don&rsquo;t know why I even had them in the first place, other than that they loosely relate to the music aspect of the Sunday service. We need to find somebody else to be responsible for making sure the overheads with song lyrics are ready, and that someone is available to run them. It&rsquo;s a stress that I don&rsquo;t need on Sunday morning. My fear is that we won&rsquo;t be able to find someone with a level of responsibility high enough to actually ensure that it gets done correctly.</li>
<li>Drop my elder apprenticing role for now. While my gifting and desire is still to be an elder and to participate in church leadership, I&rsquo;m appreciating more and more the counsel my dad gave me this summer: that while there is no real age restriction on eldership, there is a &ldquo;season of life&rdquo; where your time is needed elsewhere. Family responsibilities have to come first.</li>
<li>Spread out the worship team leadership load. Right now I&rsquo;m responsible for planning the service every week, then leading the practice and then both Sunday morning services. Every week. We have two teams of musicians/singers, but only one leader. I&rsquo;ve taken maybe 3 weeks off in the past year. That&rsquo;s just not enough. What I&rsquo;d like to do is find someone willing to take leadership of one of the two worship teams. That way I&rsquo;d only be responsible for planning and leading every-other week. I think that would be do-able.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put these plans of abdication on hold for a week or two since I promised my pastor (who is also a good friend and has really been my mentor for the past several years) that I wouldn&rsquo;t make a decision without discussing it with him again, and he&rsquo;s on a well-deserved vacation to Florida until the end of this week. We discussed it on the phone back before he left; he expressed his desire to talk it over so he could give me some &ldquo;objective&rdquo; advice. I laughed out loud. I hope I didn&rsquo;t offend him. Good advice he will have in abundance. Objective? Not for a minute. He has a stake in this as well; if I dropped everything musically at the church it would have a big impact on Sunday worship services. I know it sounds conceited, but, sadly, it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>What I need to hear him say is this: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to leave things totally. I think there are ways you can reduce your responsibilities without dropping everything. But, if you think it&rsquo;s what God is calling you to do, then I will support you on that.&rdquo; I think I will hear it, but I haven&rsquo;t heard it yet.</p>
<p>I will be continuing to pray for God&rsquo;s leading in this area. I need wisdom. And Lord, if You want to just send a couple good worship leaders to <a href="http://www.noelridgeparkchurch.org">Noelridge</a>, that would be fine with me, too. :-)</p>

<p>I was prompted by <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/karibeth/archives/2005/10/17/and-i-awoke-in-the-house-of-god/">Kari&rsquo;s piece</a> the other day to revisit Rich Mullins' <em>A Liturgy, A Legacy, and a Ragamuffin Band.</em> I have long counted this as one of my favorite albums, but it tends to be one of my forgotten favorites; I don&rsquo;t listen to it for a while, and then when I turn it on again, I wonder why I ever forgot about it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t pick a favorite song of of this album, but the song I quoted here is one of the best. Rich nails the feelings that I have about the land where I live with these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody tells you when you get born here How much you&rsquo;ll come to love it And how you&rsquo;ll never belong here So I call you my country And I&rsquo;ll be lonely for my home And I wish that I could take you there with me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much else to say about it&hellip; but if you haven&rsquo;t listened to this album for a while, get it back out. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday night I sat down in front of the TV, looking forward to watching a hockey game. The Dallas Stars were playing the Phoenix Coyotes, and according to the TV schedule, it was slated to be broadcast on <a href="http://www.olntv.com">OLN</a> (cable channel 69 in our area) at 7:30 PM central time. I was bewildered to find that rather than the NHL, OLN was showing some cheesy show about the &ldquo;25 scariest animals&rdquo; or the &ldquo;10 worst jobs&rdquo; or something like that. Where was my hockey?</p>
<p>A quick check of the <a href="http://www.olntv.com">OLN website</a> confirmed that they were showing the NHL. They even have a cool graphic that says &ldquo;NHL on OLN: We believe in hockey.&rdquo; I double-checked the TV listings at <a href="http://www.excite.com">Excite</a>. Yep, it was supposed to be on. I checked <a href="http://www.nhl.com">nhl.com</a>. Yep, they agreed that the game was supposed to be on OLN, and even gave an in-progress score. So what the heck was going on?</p>
<p>Next I did a Google search, and I found <a href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/ny-spzip234394749aug23,0,7220593.column?coll=ny-sports-columnists">this article</a> from <a href="http://www.newsday.com">Newsday</a>. It ends up that OLN is in a wrestling match with several major cable companies, apparently including my local provider, <a href="http://www.mediacomcc.com">Mediacom</a>. They want OLN to be a first-tier channel, i.e. have it included in the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; cable package that the company offers, rather than have it as part of a second-tier, pay-extra package. And so they are using blackouts of NHL games to try to blackmail the cable companies into switching around their cable packages.</p>
<p>The end result of all this: a whole bunch of really mad fans. Check out the <a href="http://ww2.olntv.com/olnbb/index.php">OLN forum</a>, for one. The funny part (OK, it&rsquo;s not so funny, maybe ironic?) is that the people that paid extra to get that second-tier so they could watch hockey are the exact ones that are getting screwed. No hockey for you! If I were Gary Bettman, I&rsquo;d be getting pretty upset with OLN - why, after already almost killing your league with a cancelled season, would you want to further alienate your fan base by blacking out TV coverage and not explaining why?</p>
<p>I will be contacting all three parties to express my frustration. I doubt it&rsquo;ll accomplish anything, though. I should check&hellip; does some other network have TV rights for the Stanley Cup playoffs? If not, I may miss another whole season. Arrrrgh.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m getting a cold. I&rsquo;d forgotten how much I hate colds. You can&rsquo;t breathe, and your throat feels nasty. I&rsquo;m thinking I might head home and try to take a nap.</p>
<p>On a totally unrelated note, there was a fun little episode with Laura last night that&rsquo;s worth relating. We were heading out to run a couple short errands last night, and she <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t want to get in her carseat. But she finally did, and we ran to the video store and then to pick up cheesesticks from Papa John&rsquo;s. In both cases, Laura and I just sat in the car while Becky ran in.</p>
<p>While we were waiting at Papa John&rsquo;s, I could tell she was really getting bored just sitting there, not getting to do anything. So, I grabbed a little toy rabbit and proceeded to play peekaboo between Laura and the rabbit, a game that she&rsquo;s enjoyed on previous occasions. After bemusedly considering the rabbit, she looked at me with a tired look that seemed to say &ldquo;thanks for trying dad, it&rsquo;s not really that interesting, but I appreciate the effort.&rdquo; Hard to explain, but one of those mundane yet priceless moments that make parenting such a joy.</p>

			 <p>So, after months of planning, debating, and voting, we finally have a new name for our church. Formerly Noelridge Baptist Church, we are now Noelridge Park Church. We will be implementing the change as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a good choice. People wanted to keep the Noelridge name. (it&rsquo;s the name of the surrounding neighborhood.) They had discussed Community or Bible as words to go in the name, but those are so common as to be kind of &ldquo;blah&rdquo;. &ldquo;Park&rdquo; is good since we&rsquo;re right across the street from the park, and it also has a bit of a stately feel to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got the domain name registered (<a href="http://www.noelridgeparkchurch.org">www.noelridgeparkchurch.org</a>), and as soon as I can get a few pictures taken we&rsquo;ll have a new website up. We&rsquo;re still in need of a logo, so if any of my loyal readers happen to have mad talents with graphic design and want to do some <em>pro bono</em> work, leave a comment and let me know.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fun to see things moving in this direction. I am excited as I look forward to what the Lord will do in the coming months.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f5715f336e.jpg" alt="The guys in concert">Last Saturday afternoon I got to see <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a> in concert at &ldquo;Cornfest&rdquo; in Clermont, IA. Clermont is a little bitty farm town, and this &ldquo;Cornfest&rdquo; thing was pretty much a start-up festival, I think&hellip; they had some small Christian music acts going for most of the afternoon, and then their headliner was the aforementined Andys. I&rsquo;ll note here that it&rsquo;s a good thing that they booked those guys - probably 70% of the folks that were there for the concert came specifically to hear Andy P.</p>
<p>I felt kinda bad for the Andys that the concert was not very well attended - maybe 150 people, max. They had a large flat-bed trailer for a stage and had to battle bugs all afternoon - asian beetles, bees, other nasty things. Some lady shared some bug spray with them after about the third song and I think that helped things out a bit. And yes, there was somebody riding atop a Holstein cow in the background. Only in Iowa.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/d7dfc4ea11.jpg" alt="Technical difficulties">Anyhow, it was just three of them - the two Andys and then Ben Shive on keyboards. They did a two-hour set, with lots of stories and bad jokes in between. There were also impromptu versions of the Rawhide theme and an old Spin Doctors song (can&rsquo;t remember the name&hellip;) I&rsquo;m not familiar with Andy P&rsquo;s music yet (an omission which I am hurriedly correcting) so I can&rsquo;t give a song-by-song breakdown. Suffice to say that he did a few songs off of his new album, took several requests, and filled in with other favorites.</p>
<p>The show was marred by a few technical difficulties; Andy was complaining all afternoon that his guitar sounded funny in the monitor (it sounded fine to the audience) and so in the course of several songs they replaced the guitar cable, the direct box, the mic cable that connected the direct box to the board, and then both the 9-volt batteries in his guitar pre-amp. (Andy O had to steal 9-volts out of two of his guitar pedals to make this last fix happen.) The time required for these fixes gave time for Andy O to sing one of his songs (<em>High School Band</em>, so I wasn&rsquo;t complaining about the other issues. :-)</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/8e0864f18e.jpg" alt="Me and Andy O">After the concert the three of them hung around and talked with folks until almost everyone had left. I was really wanting to meet Andy O (having missed him at the Caedmon&rsquo;s concert last year), and was not disappointed - we talked for a while and had a good time. Ben and Andy P seemed like nice guys, too.</p>
<p>But the best was yet to come. There were a couple little kids who had a couple favorite Andy P songs that they wanted to hear and that he hadn&rsquo;t done in concert. So, he grabbed his trusty Taylor and proceeded to take requests for another 45 minutes&hellip; just him singing and about 20 of us perched on the side of the hill listening. It was awesome. I kept thinking he was about ready to wrap up, but then he&rsquo;d ask for any more requests, and somebody would ask for a song, and so he&rsquo;d tell the story about the song, and then sing it&hellip; wow. After a while Ben and Andy O came and sacked out on the hill next to the rest of us, just enjoying the music and the beautiful afternoon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/f2b5bebc63.jpg" alt="the mini-set">So then towards the end of that &ldquo;set&rdquo;, Andy P sang a goofy little song he&rsquo;d written for his daughter. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called, but the chorus has a line about her &ldquo;one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten pretty little toes&rdquo;. About halfway through the song Andy O got up and wandered off - I think he was going to pack some gear into his car. But it was too good not to comment on, so after the song was over I asked Andy P if he&rsquo;d run Andy O off, made him feel inadequate by singing a song about somebody with ten toes. (For the reader unfamiliar with Andy O&rsquo;s toe situation, see his blog here.) Andy P got a good chuckle out of that, then told the story about Andy O&rsquo;s run-in with the lawnmower, and mentioned that it was the middle toe, &ldquo;Roast Beef&rdquo;, that was missing. So then I had to mention Andy Gullahorn&rsquo;s song by that name, and so we tried to come up with the lines to that song&hellip; but between Andy P, Ben, and myself, we could only come up with the first few lines. It was still pretty funny.</p>
<p>Let me say here just last that I was also hugely blessed by my wife that afternoon; our daughter Laura was getting tired and antsy as only toddlers can. Becky was very gracious and willing to deal with her so that I could take advantage of the chance to enjoy the concert and meet the guys. Fortunately Laura fell asleep right before the acoustic mini-set, so she got to enjoy that time.</p>
<p>I could ramble on for quite a while, but I&rsquo;ll spare you. Let&rsquo;s just say I came away from last Saturday with a good sunburn, a heightened appreciation for my wife, and a real blessing from getting to meet one man who is my favorite artist right now, and another who is quickly climbing that list.</p>
<p>(Full-sized photos of the afternoon are available on my flickr page <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrishubbs/tags/andypetersonconcert/">here</a>.)</p>

			 <p>I was remembering those Taco Bell ads the other day - the ones where a guy eats a burrito or something, and then comes out and reports in the glorious celebration &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full!&rdquo; And everybody cheers. And it got me to thinking. Why is it that they think they need to celebrate being full?</p>
<p>I struggle off and on with being frustrated with my weight. I have a desk job, and I don&rsquo;t exercise much, and so I&rsquo;ve battled &ldquo;the bulge&rdquo; for several years now. And as I got to thinking about it the other day, I was trying to remember the last time I really felt hungry. Typically what happens is that I eat my meals with largeish portions at regular times, (the family&rsquo;s gotta run on a schedule, after all), and I eat so much that I&rsquo;m never really hungry - I&rsquo;m just eating because I&rsquo;m not too full and hey, it&rsquo;s time to eat.</p>
<p>So the last few days I&rsquo;ve been making a bigger effort to eat less, and to enjoy the feeling of being hungry between meals. It&rsquo;s a little different, but it feels good. Now if I could just couple it with some exercise, maybe I&rsquo;d be getting somewhere&hellip;</p>
<p>So forget about all those Taco Bell commercials. You don&rsquo;t really buy their food, anyway&hellip;. you just rent it for a while. :-) My new cause for celebration: I&rsquo;m hungry!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll come up with a more thoughtful post one of these days, I promise. But for now, more boring information! :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get ahold of a wireless USB adapter that will work with my Tivo so I can transfer programs onto my PC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> I went out and bought some wireless adapter at random from Walmart. Oops. Bad idea. Tivo doesn&rsquo;t support very many adapters. Took that one back and got a refund. Arrrrrgh.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Researched carefully, bought a WUSB12 that the online forums assured me would work fine. Got it online, it arrived via Fedex yesterday. It didn&rsquo;t work. It ends up that certain versions of a WUSB12 will work with Tivo&hellip; but there wasn&rsquo;t any version info avalilable on the online store. Arrrrgh.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.1:</strong> Figured I&rsquo;d need to return this one as well, requested an RMA number.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.2:</strong> Realized that maybe I could sell it here instead to get out of the &ldquo;store credit&rdquo; hassle.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.3:</strong> Listed it on the buy/sell newsgroup here at work this morning. Sold it within 1 hour. After I send in for the rebate on this puppy, I&rsquo;ll actually be a few bucks ahead. Woohoo!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to a local store and purchase one that I can check the model/serial/version number on <em>before</em> I buy it, or, at least, that I have the ability to return locally if it doesn&rsquo;t work. No time to do this tonight, but tomorrow, maybe.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s episode. Tune in tomorrow when Chris goes to BestBuy and asks, &ldquo;hey buddy, ya got a D-Link DWL-G122?&rdquo;</p>

			 <p><strong>ser·en·dip·i·ty</strong> n. pl. ser·en·dip·i·ties</p>
<p>1. The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident. 2. The fact or occurrence of such discoveries. 3. An instance of making such a discovery.</p>
<p><strong><em>Practical definition:</em></strong></p>
<p>Discovering a good concert near your home just a week before said concert.</p>
<p>Specifically? I was browsing <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com">Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s website</a> this morning to get details on his Christmas tour.</p>
<p>OK, just a bit about the Christmas tour first. Andy P will be bringing his &ldquo;Behold the Lamb&rdquo; Christmas tour to Cedar Rapids, IA on Saturday, December 2. It apparently is being hosted by Youth for Christ as a fundraiser. Seeing as I know the local director of YFC, I&rsquo;m going to have to see if they need any volunteer help for the day. :-) Bonus number 1 this morning was finding out that <a href="http://www.derekwebb.com">Derek Webb</a>, his wife <a href="http://www.sandramccracken.com">Sandra McCracken</a>, and <a href="http://www.jillphillips.com">Jill Phillips</a> will all be coming along on this tour. (I suppose the die-hards already knew this, but it was news to me.) So, a big woohoo! for Andy, Derek, and Sandra all in concert in my home town.</p>
<p>Now, the other serendipity: Andy P will be playing a concert in Clermont, IA (about a 2-hour drive from my home) on October 1st (a week from Saturday). It looks like it&rsquo;s an outdoor concert, 3pm, at the &ldquo;Cornfest&rdquo; (and yes, I know, that sounds about as stereotypically Iowan as possible) at Heritage Farm Park in Clermont. Sounds like a nice way to spend a fall Saturday: a drive through the countryside, a good concert, who can ask for better? I&rsquo;d been wishing to hear some of the stuff from <em>The Far Country</em> in concert&hellip; now my wish can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s my happy report for the day. Rejoice with me! :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I just finished reading <em>The Present Future: Six Tough Questions for the Church</em> by Reggie McNeal. He is a SBC pastor who uses this book to challenge the modern-day church to stop thinking so much like a club and start thinking more missionally. I don&rsquo;t agree with everything he had to say, but there were some points that really hit home.</p>
<p>One of the big ones, that I&rsquo;m still kinda working over right now, is the comment (and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing throughout this post since I don&rsquo;t have the book with me) that we are too church-based with our faith; our church culture is one where we don&rsquo;t have many (or any) friends outside the church, and where we expect to deal with issues of faith at church rather than at home. He notes that there are too many couples that are embarrassed to discuss their faith with each other at home, but are really active at church.</p>
<p>That one hits home with me. Not that I&rsquo;m embarrassed to discuss my faith at home, but we don&rsquo;t (discuss it) that much. We don&rsquo;t do well at having devotions together. I&rsquo;ll assign the fault to myself; it&rsquo;s my job as the leader to see that it happens. And why don&rsquo;t we? Because we&rsquo;re &ldquo;too busy&rdquo;. Too busy, often, having to get to church to prepare for worship team, or to prepare for some church event, or to get to some church function. Now, perhaps there are other priority issues; the hour of TV most nights could be done away with, I suppose. But that doesn&rsquo;t escape the fact that all of the efforts that I&rsquo;m putting into &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; stuff, if I can call it that, are all church-focused, and none of them are outwardly-focused.</p>
<p>Part of me would really like to try this as an experiment: relinquish all of my church duties. Just stop. And then start to get things arranged in my own life and in our family life. Figure out what our needs and family things ought to be. Just to reassess. Then once I get that figured out, I can start figuring out where God wants me directed.</p>
<p>But there is the other side of my dilemma. I&rsquo;m doing good stuff right now. I enjoy (for the most part) what I&rsquo;m doing. I have a lot of people that count on me, for music at church, for technical help on ministry websites, etc etc. I can&rsquo;t just leave them in the lurch&hellip; and the odds of my being able to gracefully exit from those responsibilities is next to nil.</p>
<p>So here I am. I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is right now. I think a lot of prayer is in order.</p>

			 <p>After months of prayer, planning, and discussion, we took a congregational vote last night of intent to change the church name. The question wasn&rsquo;t one of voting for a specific new name; rather, in this step, we indicated our decision that we want the name to change. Next up is to pick a specific name. We&rsquo;ll meet again in a couple weeks to do that.</p>
<p>Our hope in this whole thing is that our church name would not be an impediment to the gospel. I think it&rsquo;s a good step.</p>

			 <p>So yesterday I took my guitar in to see about getting the pickup fixed.</p>
<p>Let me back up. I have a Takamine Acoustic/Electric that my folks got for me back 12 or so years ago. It&rsquo;s been a very serviceable guitar. About 2 years ago it developed a short in the end-pin jack, so I couldn&rsquo;t get it amplified. Now, I hadn&rsquo;t been playing it that much, so it didn&rsquo;t matter too much. Finally, about 18 months ago I took it in to our local guitar shop, <a href="http://www.starsguitars.biz">Stars Guitars</a>, to have them replace the jack. They replaced it, but then found that they couldn&rsquo;t get the pickup to work at all. So, they didn&rsquo;t charge me for the jack, but didn&rsquo;t solve my problem, either.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this week. I&rsquo;m now playing guitar for church every-other week, and my in-hole single-coil passive pickup just isn&rsquo;t cutting it. So, I figured I&rsquo;d take it back in and have them take another look. About an hour after I left it there, I get a call on my cell phone. When can I come pick it up?</p>
<p>It ends up that whoever installed the end pin jack last time wired it backwards. Oops. Switch the wires and everything works fine.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ll go pick it up tonight. Better late than never.</p>

			 <p>Becky was bored the other day and reading over some blogs (something she doesn&rsquo;t do very often), and after about an hour she informed my that my blog is boring. While other folks (my siblings and friends) tend to write about their feelings, what&rsquo;s going on in their lives, what they&rsquo;re learning, deep stuff, my posts tend to be more &ldquo;informational&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I thought about it a bit and agreed with her; because I tend to post quickly, my posts end up being short bits of information, updates on my life, and occasionally reviews of things I&rsquo;ve heard or read. You find precious little in the way of soul-searching or philosophizing. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t do those things enough in the rest of my life, or if I just don&rsquo;t get them transferred to my blog with much regularity.</p>
<p>In my defense, I did point out to her that blogging styles differ greatly depending on the person; I gave her for reference <a href="http://www.ijsm.org">Geof&rsquo;s</a> more terse, informational style, <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/karibeth/">Kari&rsquo;s</a> writings on life (and her book reviews), and <a href="http://forbieland.blogspot.com">Michaela&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://forbieland.blogspot.com/2005/05/afternoon.html">picturesque essays</a>. I don&rsquo;t think she read them; she had to go do something else. She did remark, though, on how my being able to reference, from the top of my head, several other blogs for examples just made me even geekier. I suppose she&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>Also in my defense, I noted that when I extra time to just sit and write, my writing style changes. Reference <a href="/05/05/moody-conference-day-1/">a post</a> from the pastor&rsquo;s conference this summer. She acknowledged that this was true, and that I don&rsquo;t have much time to write. Of course, then last night after I&rsquo;d spent 45 minutes catching up on my blog reading while we were watching football, she remarked that if I hadn&rsquo;t spent all that time catching up on other people (most of whom I&rsquo;ve never met), I&rsquo;d have had time to write some stuff myself. Probably true, but I just wasn&rsquo;t ready to write last night. Reading was good.</p>
<p>So I guess from time to time I should try to make my blog more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;. In the mean time, bear with my &ldquo;informational&rdquo; style. :-) Hey, if anything, a blog should represent the personality of the person behind it&hellip; and mine does. Good enough for me.</p>

			 <p>I have a confession to make. I had been avoiding purchasing <a href="http://www.andrew-peterson.com/">Andrew Peterson</a>&rsquo;s latest album. I don&rsquo;t know exactly why; I think I had listened to his previous album once and it didn&rsquo;t really do anything for me. So, I ignored the rave reviews of the RMFO folks and passed it by. I mean, I purchase too many CDs anyway. It&rsquo;s a really bad habit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, I was in the local Christian bookstore on a quest to purchase another item, and <em>The Far Country</em> was sitting there on the demo rack, taunting me. I fearlessly slipped on the headphones and took the challenge. About 30 seconds into the first track I was hooked. I listened to bits of the first three songs, had my opinion cemented enough to merit the sacrifice of $13.97, grabbed a copy, and headed to the cash register. I took it home and listened all the way through it twice (along with repeats of a couple songs an additional time or two), and have listened to it twice again today.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it&hellip;. this is a <em>phenomenal</em> album. Andy P has captured the longing for that far-away place with songs like <em>The Havens Grey</em>, <em>Lay Me Down</em>, and, perhaps most notably, <em>Little Boy Heart Alive</em>. His songs are rich in imagery, with abundant references to the writings of C. S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. Musically, this album is also a gem. From the light rock of the title track, to the soft tones of <em>The Queen of Iowa</em>, to the acoustic wonder of <em>Mystery of Mercy</em> (a nice contrast to the Caedmon&rsquo;s Call version of the same song), it just grabs you from beginning to end.</p>
<p>There were two times listening to <em>The Far Country</em> when I felt like I was listening to the late great Rich Mullins: the hammer dulcimer on <em>Mystery of Mercy</em>, and, well, the whole song <em>Little Boy Heart Alive</em>. I could write so much about that particular song&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;ll make it a separate blog post. It is terrific.</p>
<p>Learn from my lesson. If you haven&rsquo;t heard this album yet, go listen to it. It&rsquo;ll grab you. In the end, you&rsquo;ll thank me. Yes, it&rsquo;s that good.</p>
<p>One final comment: there is this choice credit in the album liner: &ldquo;Assistant Executive Producer: <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com/blog/2005/05/14/this-little-piggy/">Andrew Osenga&rsquo;s Right Middle Toe, Esq.</a>&rdquo; :-)</p>

			 <p>I received my OfficeMax gift card yesterday in the mail. It was accompanied by a cheesy little letter telling me how sorry they were that my PDA broke, and praising me for my foresight in purchasing a replacement plan, and expressing their hope that I would buy a replacement plan again for my new PDA. Heh. So, last night I went to OfficeMax and purchased a new Palm Tungsten E2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to work out OK. I had to put an extra $50 out of pocket, but it has a $50 rebate coming back from Palm, and it came with a nifty leather cover as a bonus. The one thing I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed about is that they changed the sync cable interface&hellip; the old Tunsten E had a mini-USB connector, which was great since I already had a couple of those cables. My guess is that Palm realized they weren&rsquo;t making enough money on extra cables and such, so they went back to some proprietary connector. Arrrgh. Now I need to decide what to get so I can sync it at home, too&hellip; I&rsquo;m thinking maybe a cradle for here at work&hellip;</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;ll have to find other subjects to keep up my consistent blogging. Maybe it&rsquo;ll be good for me to prove that I can consistently write even when it&rsquo;s not about something that&rsquo;s making me mad. :-)</p>

			 <p>Still counting. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get my gift card before the holiday weekend&hellip; but that may be too much to hope for.</p>
<p>I sent an inquiry last week via the OfficeMax website, requesting some contact information. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could you please send me the name of the store manager for the Cedar Rapids, IA Collins Road store, and also the name and mailing address of the district manager who has oversight over that store? I would like to contact them regarding my recent store experience. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This morning I finally received a response, but it was not very helpful&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your interest in OfficeMax.com. I don&rsquo;t have the name of the store manager. The district manager is [name deleted]. I have forwarded your email to his email address. I do apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused. If there was anything else we can help you with please feel free to contact us. Once again thank you for you interest in OfficeMax.com.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>First of all, &ldquo;Unique&rdquo;?!? I hope that&rsquo;s not somebody&rsquo;s real name&hellip; secondly, they totally ignored my request for a mailing address. Maybe he&rsquo;ll respond via e-mail, but I doubt it. Grrrrr&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Take heart, though, my entire life isn&rsquo;t this frustrating&hellip; I guess those parts are just the easy ones to blog about.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>On my last visit to the local library, I found a slim volume on the &ldquo;new books&rdquo; shelf: <em>The Simple Faith Of Mister Rogers</em>, by Amy Hollingsworth. I was a moderate watcher of <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em> when I was young, and I&rsquo;ve read just enough about Fred Rogers to know that I was intrigued when I saw the book on the shelf. Yesterday provided me with some blessed free time to read, and so I made this little book my Sunday-afternoon diversion.</p>
<p>Ms. Hollingsworth is a pastor&rsquo;s wife, a journalist, and writer. She met Fred Rogers when she had the opportunity to interview him some years ago. They then carried on a correspondance that lasted until he passed away in February 2003. From her experiences with Mr. Rogers she is able to share both observations about and philosophies learned from the man who was a daily TV visitor in so many families' homes. The result is a book that is part devotional, part biography, and part personal memoir. Regardless of the composition, though, the result is a wonderful little book.</p>
<p>Fred Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister, but took great stock in that charge oft-attributed to St. Francis of Assisi: &ldquo;preach the gospel&hellip; when necessary, use words.&rdquo; As such, his gracious, encouraging manner spoke love, peace, and comfort to his watchers even without verbal gospel presentation. What is comforting to know is that the sincerity and earnestness seen on <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em> permeated Mr. Rogers in real life, too. Ms. Hollingsworth notes that more than one person who has met Mr. Rogers has later remarked that &ldquo;he&rsquo;s more &lsquo;Mister Rogers&rsquo; than Mister Rogers!&rdquo; He was the real thing.</p>
<p>The devotional points of the book were simple, and yet good reminders for those of us who live hectic lives: go slow. Take time for silence. Don&rsquo;t neglect prayer. Encourage others. I was impressed by the consistency and simplicity of Mr. Rogers' daily routine: Up at 5:30 for devotions and prayer. Early morning swim (including singing a bit of praise to God as he entered the pool!), breakfast, then to the studio. In bed no later than 9:30 PM. The same routine, every day. I was challenged.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d recommend <em>The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers</em> to anyone who wants to gain a bit more appreciation for the value of living a genuine, simple, whole-hearted life. It will also be interesting to those who have enjoyed <em>Mister Rogers Neighborhood</em> but are unfamiliar with the man and the faith behind that program.</p>

			 <p>Almost three weeks now and still nothin'. Geof suggests I should skip the Tungsten and go for a Treo. I suppose that&rsquo;s an option, although if the Treo ever breaks then that means not only have I lost my PDA but I&rsquo;ve lost my cellphone, too&hellip;</p>
<p>The other thing that irks me about Palm (not OfficeMax) is that none of the PDAs come with cradles any more. They all have a mini-USB port for syncing and a separate power cord. Dang it, I like the cradle. It gives me a place to keep my PDA charged and visible while I&rsquo;m at my desk. They sell one, but it&rsquo;s an extra $40. They used to include it with the PDA. Arrrgh.</p>
<p>As an addition: I just found this fun clause in the OfficeMax MaxAssurance <a href="http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/product/article.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=no&amp;edOID=537034147">fine print</a>:</p>

<p>Meaningful service will be initiated within 48 hours of Your request and will be completed as soon as reasonably possible. If no meaningful service is initiated within such time limits and You have reasonably been available within such time limits, You may engage Your own servicer at Our expense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such great nebulous terms. &ldquo;meaningful service&rdquo;. What if I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s meaningful? &ldquo;As soon as reasonably possible.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve got to think that three weeks (and counting) is waaaaaay longer than &ldquo;reasonably possible.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s time to write a nasty letter to the store and regional managers&hellip;</p>

			 <p>We had our first worship team practice using individual microphones last night.</p>
<p>Currently, we just have one condenser mic on each side of the stage and 3 or 4 people gather around it. The sound quality is terrible. Thanks to Nate Hines who graciously loaned us 4 SM-58&rsquo;s, we now can practice using individual mics. We&rsquo;re going to split into two worship teams, each with 3 vocalists and some instrumentalists. The start date is Sept 11, so we&rsquo;ve got some work to do pretty quickly. I think it&rsquo;ll turn out OK, though.</p>
<p>Practice last night went about as well as it possibly could have; the singers really noticed how much better things were with handheld mics - better sound, you can hear everybody&hellip; good stuff. It was kinda funny - I told Janice &ldquo;sing louder, we can&rsquo;t hear you&rdquo;&hellip; and her reply: &ldquo;I thought if I can hear myself then I&rsquo;m singing too loud&hellip;&rdquo; Welcome to real sound with monitors! :-) It&rsquo;ll take some ironing out, but in the end it will be a huge improvement over our current configuration.</p>

			 <p>Just miscellaneous stuff from my life today. I got my DSL modem hooked up last night so the Casa de Cakeboy is now surfing the web at high speed and wirelessly! I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll take me a while to fully comprehend the different things this will allow me to do online&hellip; fun fun!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;m getting a new car stereo installed in the Saturn. The old one is the factory-installed basic model, and the two big problems are that a) one of the knobs is broken, and b) there&rsquo;s no good way to get iPod music through the stereo. (Waiting for somebody to suggest an FM modulator&hellip; decided against it.) The new deck was one of the less-expensive ones at Best Buy, but it has the magic feature: an AUX input to run a line in from the iPod. I can&rsquo;t wait. Especially if I&rsquo;m doing road trips to Oklahoma and Door County, Wisconsin in the next few months&hellip; gotta have the music. I&rsquo;ve had an iTrip FM transmitter for the past several months and have come to the conclusion that it just doesn&rsquo;t have the power to give me decent sound quality, and in addition it&rsquo;s really annoying having to switch frequencies every hour or so. So, the deck gets installed tomorrow. I got free installation on it too.</p>

			 <p>Nothing to report. I have meetings all morning this morning and would love to have the PDA for note-taking and boredom-reduction. Oh well&hellip;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did get a new car stereo last night which is getting installed on Friday. And tomorrow they should be turning on the DSL at the house&hellip; woohoo for broadband internet! Now if I could only get my home network functioning&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2005/08/22/not-all-that.html">not all that amusing: a review of Chris Rice&#39;s new CD</a></h1>

			 <p>I pre-ordered Chris Rice&rsquo;s new album, <em>amusing</em>, back a couple of months ago when it was advertised by <a href="http://www.ebflo.com">eb+flo</a>. This is Chris&rsquo;s first album with his new record label, <a href="http://www.inorecords.com/home/main.html">INO</a>, so I was looking forward to hearing what the effort would sound like. The album doesn&rsquo;t hit the stores until tomorrow (Tuesday August 23rd), but I received my copy in the mail last Friday. Having now had the chance to listen to it a couple times, I&rsquo;ll hazard an opinion or two.</p>
<p><strong>The Music</strong> Musically, Chris makes the most of being on a new record label that has, apparently, given him much more musical freedom. The styles are varied; from the Steven Curtis Chapman-esque bluesy-country-rock of <em>Love Like Crazy</em>, to the made-for-adult-contemporary-radio sound of <em>When Did You Fall</em>, to the quiet piano-driven tones of <em>Sleepyhead Sun</em>, he explores many sounds that will a suprise to those familiar with his discography. I could complain that it isn&rsquo;t very cohesive in sound, but that&rsquo;s the case with most of Chris&rsquo;s albums, so I won&rsquo;t suddenly hold it against him now.</p>
<p><strong>The Content</strong> The subject matter of the songs is perhaps also typically varied; he includes a couple songs that deal with romantic love which lead me to wonder if he (the long-time bachelor) has a new relationship that is driving these thoughts. But the interviews I&rsquo;ve read don&rsquo;t mention a thing about it, nor do the liner notes. Bummer.</p>
<p><strong>The Lyrics</strong> Here&rsquo;s where I am more disappointed with <em>amusing</em>. It seems to be missing a song or two with the depth that his previous albums have included. Think back on <em>Deep Enough to Dream</em> (from the album <em>Deep Enough to Dream</em>), <em>The Power of a Moment</em> (from <em>Past the Edges</em>), <em>Home Tonight</em> (from <em>Smell the Color 9</em>), <em>Untitled Hymn (Come to Jesus)</em>, or <em>Wonder</em> (both from <em>Run the Earth, Watch the Sky</em>). They are songs full of picturesque, thoughtful lyrics, laden with symbolism and imagery. They are the depth that keeps me coming back to those albums again and again. Sadly, <em>amusing</em> doesn&rsquo;t seem to include much of anything in that vein.</p>
<p>What it does contain in great measure is the more overt, and, to my mind, less-insightful lyrics that eventually drove me away from the music of Steven Curtis Chapman. For instance, the chorus of <em>Love Like Crazy</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love like crazy We gotta love like crazy We gotta love like crazy The way he loves you and me &lsquo;Cause if the world&rsquo;s ever gonna change We gotta love like crazy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be insightful and motivating for the high-school camp crowd, but it leaves me wanting more. Or this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life gave me lemonade and I can&rsquo;t imagine why Born on a sunny day, beneath a tangerine sky I live life without pretending I&rsquo;m a sucker for happy endings Thanks for the lemonade Thanks for the lemonade!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s OK&hellip;. but color me a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>This album will not really change my overall opinion of Chris Rice; he&rsquo;s still one of my favorite songwriters, he&rsquo;s still provided some of the most thoughtful and worshipful stuff that I&rsquo;ve ever heard. I&rsquo;m hoping that <em>amusing</em> is just one slightly low spot in the road that will quickly be forgotten when the next album comes around. It may, though, prompt me to skip the pre-ordering next time and wait to get a listen before making my purchase.</p>

			 <p>OK, I&rsquo;ll admit it: I have a CD-buying habit. It&rsquo;s not as destructive or expensive as many other habits I could have, but it still drives me to purchase more music, new music all the time.</p>
<p>My last new CD came in the mail on Friday - I had pre-ordered <a href="http://www.chrisrice.com/">Chris Rice</a>&rsquo;s new CD, <em>amused</em>, back a couple of months ago. I&rsquo;m not sure how well I like it yet; I&rsquo;ll have to listen some more. Chris Rice has been on my automatically-buy list pretty much ever since his first album, and I haven&rsquo;t been disappointed yet. Hopefully the streak continues. Before that, I got <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a>&rsquo;s <em>[Souvenirs &amp; Postcards]</em>, and then just before that <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a>&rsquo;s <em>War and Peace</em>. I guess you could say I&rsquo;m just doing catch-up as I find these new artists that I like so much.</p>
<p>Since I have to hold back a bit, I&rsquo;ll at least post my list here so I can add to it from time to time, or note when I have purchased another one. If any of you reading this feel the desire to get one for me, go ahead. :-) They are listed in a basic priority order&hellip; which is always subject to change.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.thenormals.com/">The Normals</a></strong> I don&rsquo;t own any of their albums yet, but I should get all of them:_</p>
<ul>
<li>A Place Where You Belong</li>
<li>Coming To Life</li>
<li>Better Than This</li>
</ul>
<p>They are available, all 3 for $24 at <a href="http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml#music">http://www.creativesitesmedia.com/normals/merch.shtml</a>. I will admit to being torn between getting them for that good price or supporting Andy O directly by buying them from his site at a slightly higher price.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arkadelphia</li>
<li>The Hymnal</li>
</ul>
<p>Available for purchase at <a href="http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/">http://www.uthstuph.com/ws/randallgoodgame/</a>. I appreciate his <em>War and Peace</em> more every time I hear it&hellip; I need to catch up on his other stuff.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sufjan.com">Sufjan Stevens</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Illinois</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/05/08/come-on-feel-the-illinoise/">I wrote about this one before.</a> I still haven&rsquo;t purchased it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sandramccracken.com">Sandra McCracken</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gypsy Flat Road</li>
<li>The Crucible</li>
</ul>
<p>I have only one of Sandra&rsquo;s albums right now: <em>Best Laid Plans</em>. I&rsquo;d sure like to add the other two.</p>
<p>Other things floating around at the bottom of the list: Ryan Adams' <em>[Cold Roses]</em>, and maybe Nickel Creek&rsquo;s <em>[Why Should the Fire Die?]</em>.</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s it for now. I imagine I&rsquo;ll be adding to this list before I subtract from it too much. :-)</p>

<p>It is starting to drive me crazy not having my PDA.

If I had any other big purchases planned, I&rsquo;d just go buy one from somewhere today and then use the OfficeMax gift card later for that purchase&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t know what it might be.</p>

			 <p>There have been a ton of reviews of Sufjan Stevens' new album, <em>[Illinois]</em>, floating around lately. I hadn&rsquo;t heard any of his music, and after having one friend say &ldquo;eh&hellip; not getting into it that much&rdquo;, I had pretty much decided that it was going to go on my ignore list. But then three nights in a row, listening to my local NPR station whilst driving my car, I heard some rather interesting tunes&hellip; which, when the announcer came back to credit them, were all from the aforementioned Mr. Stevens album.</p>
<p>My interest thus piqued, I did a little internet research and found that Amazon has two free tracks you can download. Then I found <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/richard/2005/08/17/sufjan-mp3s/">this post</a> on <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/richard/">Richard&rsquo;s blog</a> which pointed me towards several more downloads. I&rsquo;ve downloaded 6 tracks so far (which is only about 25% of the album&hellip;) and I&rsquo;m really impressed. The song names are goofy (<em>&ldquo;The Black Hawk War, Or, How To Demolish An Entire Civilization And Still Feel Good About Yourself In The Morning, Or, We Apologize For The Inconvenience But You&rsquo;re Going To Have To Leave Now, Or, &lsquo;I Have Fought The Big Knives And Will Continue To Fight Them Until They Are Off Our Lands!'&quot;</em> is just one example), the subject matter is at times bizzare (<em>&ldquo;John Wayne Gacy, Jr.&quot;</em>), but the end result is captivating. The layered instrumentation, the quirky rhythms (the first track is in a neat 5/4 time), Sufjan&rsquo;s mellow vocals, they all serve to create a total package that&rsquo;s unlike anything I&rsquo;ve ever heard before&hellip; but engrossing at the same time.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m going to have to go out and buy this album. I looked for it at BestBuy the other night and it was nowhere to be found. Maybe Barnes &amp; Noble will have it; it&rsquo;s on sale on their website, maybe it&rsquo;ll be on sale in the store, too. I have a car trip planned to Wisconsin for this weekend; it would be fun to add <em>Illinois</em> to the journey.</p>

			 <p>Last week was killer. I had soooo much to do. <a href="/05/08/a-busy-weekend/">I&rsquo;ve talked about this already</a> so I won&rsquo;t go on and on again.</p>
<p>It all went really well. The wedding was beautiful. The music worked out just fine, and the song that I was singing (and had never sung before) was right in my comfortable singing range. All good.</p>
<p>Saturday night after the wedding, my brothers and I went over to the church and worked up our worship set for the Sunday service. After we got that together, it degenerated into a Caedmon&rsquo;s Call/Derek Webb jam session&hellip; good times.</p>
<p>Sunday morning the music went well; it was nice to have a strong lead guitar&hellip;. way to go Andrew!</p>
<p>Then came the sermon. I hadn&rsquo;t prepared quite as much as I would&rsquo;ve liked, but the message got out anyway. It&rsquo;s a funny thing; you preach a sermon, and then the first 5 people that come up to you all say things like &ldquo;hey, you made me think of [this point] or [that point]&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m standing there thinking, &ldquo;wow, those are good points, how did I miss those?&rdquo; But then I recognize and appreciate that God used my words to speak in specific ways to specific people, even if it wasn&rsquo;t what I thought I was going to teach them. Praise the Lord!</p>
<p>My family all took off for their respective homes after lunch on Sunday. After a short trip to the local sweet corn festival, it was time to come home and crash. The Cubs and the Cardinals were the Sunday night game on ESPN, and the Cubbies found a way to win the game! I can&rsquo;t make sense of how they can drop 8 in a row, including getting swept by the Reds, but then can take 3 out of 4 against the league-leaders&hellip; but it was a fun game to watch, a nice way to end the weekend.</p>
<p>Next weekend we&rsquo;re going to Wisconsin to visit the family again (gotta take the chances to see Aaron while he&rsquo;s in-country), and I&rsquo;ve just about got everything taken care of. I still haven&rsquo;t managed to get ahold of the replacement pianist yet for Sunday&hellip; two e-mails and a phone message, and still no response. I hope she&rsquo;s in town&hellip;</p>

			 <p><em>Note from Chris: I&rsquo;m not usually this bitter&hellip; but I&rsquo;m taking no small pleasure in the fact that this blog is the first Google hit on the search for &ldquo;OfficeMax Replacement Plan&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t know that my complaints will result in anything, but I&rsquo;m going to document the arduous process.</em></p>
<p>Today is the ninth day since I started the process rolling to try to get my dead Palm Tungsten E replaced under the &ldquo;MaxAssurance&rdquo; plan I purchased from OfficeMax. Still no pre-paid mailing label. How long can it take to send a mailing label? If this is indicative of the way the whole process will go, I fully expect to be without my PDA for about 6 weeks, which to me is just unacceptable for a &ldquo;replacement plan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A few choice quotes from the OfficeMax website:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The parts that crack me up the most are &ldquo;No deductible&ndash;no unexpected future costs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Product experts are ready to provide instant troubleshooting, information and reliable service when you need it most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah, if &ldquo;no unexpected future costs&rdquo; means &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to put out at least another $50 to get a replacement&rdquo; and &ldquo;product experts&rdquo; are call-center workers working from a really short script&hellip;</p>
<p>Side note: I&rsquo;ve seen the return process done really well; when I got a bad item from <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com">musiciansfriend.com</a>, I called and they asked for my e-mail address; they sent me a link to get a pre-paid UPS label online, and I had it that same evening and shipped the stuff the next day. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> how it should be done.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t posted much this week&hellip; it&rsquo;s been just a bit on the busy side. There&rsquo;s been plenty to do at work, which means little boredom or free time, and the evenings have been just crazy.</p>
<p>This afternoon my family is coming to visit, which I&rsquo;m very excited about - I haven&rsquo;t seen my brother Aaron since Christmas since he&rsquo;s been in Panama doing missions work. They&rsquo;ll be staying all weekend.</p>
<p>Tonight I have a wedding rehearsal for a friend; I&rsquo;m playing the piano and singing. Last night I had to write a transcription of a song that she wants played that there&rsquo;s no sheet music for. It&rsquo;s an instrumental from the soundtrack to the movie <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314331/">Love Actually</a></em>. It&rsquo;s a nice little instrumental, not too tough. Still, extra hassle having to transcribe. I just don&rsquo;t trust my memory enough to do it without some music.</p>
<p>Saturday is the wedding, and I also need to get music together with my brothers for leading worship on Sunday. Still not sure what we&rsquo;re going to do, but I&rsquo;ll try to get a couple of them involved.</p>
<p>Sunday I&rsquo;m not only leading worship, but also filling the pulpit since the pastor&rsquo;s on vacation. This&rsquo;ll be my third time preaching a full sermon, so I&rsquo;m not really worried about it, but it&rsquo;s just another thing I have to try to stuff into my brain so that I&rsquo;m not just totally reading it off of the page. The sermon is going to be from <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=2+thess+1%3A11-12&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search">2 Thess 1:11-12</a>, if you&rsquo;re really interested.</p>
<p>I think by Sunday night I&rsquo;ll be ready to collapse. About my only remaining task after that is to ensure I have a musician lined up for next week&rsquo;s worship, since I&rsquo;ll be taking the week off. I can&rsquo;t wait&hellip;</p>

			 <p>My Palm Pilot died yesterday. OK, so they don&rsquo;t call it a Palm Pilot anymore; mine is actually the Palm Tungsten E. It has served me faithfully for the last 18 months, keeping me apprised of impending meetings at work, storing the orders of worship from 2 years' worth of church services, keeping a running list of books that I want to read, and giving me hours of diversion with games when I&rsquo;m bored.</p>
<p>Yesterday it died. When I picked it up at 2 PM, the screen was frozen with the notification &ldquo;Meet with Christy re: Performance Review, 8:30 AM&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite possible that I hadn&rsquo;t picked it up all day&hellip; It wouldn&rsquo;t power off, it wouldn&rsquo;t go to any other screen or program. So, I hit the reset button. It reset OK but as soon as I hit the home button to get to the main screen, it powered off and wouldn&rsquo;t come back on. Next I tried the hard reset that erases the memory. Same story, still no luck.</p>
<p>I was thinking at that point that it was a good thing I bought the 2-year replacement plan for it. It cost me an extra $50 at the time, but hey, OfficeMax guaranteed immediate replacement if it broke. So this afternoon I took it back to OfficeMax. I had all the paperwork in order; the receipt, the packaging with the UPC and Serial number, the brochure detailing the replacement plan. I knew that they don&rsquo;t sell the Tungsten E any more, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure how they would replace it, I figured maybe I&rsquo;d have the option to buy-up to another model.</p>
<p>The manager at OfficeMax was very nice; he checked and verified that they don&rsquo;t sell the Tungsten E anymore. Then he told me that means that I have to call the 800 number on the brochure. So I called the 800 number. They are going &ldquo;within the next 7 to 10 days&rdquo;, to send me a postage-paid address label. I have to package the unit up, along with its accessories, and send it back to them. Then, &ldquo;within 10 to 15 days after receiving the device&rdquo;, and after determining that it really is broken, they will send me an OfficeMax gift card good for the original purchase price of the unit.</p>
<p>This has me pretty darn frustrated. First, that the &ldquo;replacement plan&rdquo; really isn&rsquo;t immediate replacement - it&rsquo;s going to take the better part of a month. A month? Come on, I use this thing every day! And I can&rsquo;t just get a replacement w/o laying out any more cash - the Tungsten E2 (the current model) costs $50 more than the old E, which means I&rsquo;ll have to lay out that money out of pocket to get the new one, and then more money on top of that if I want to renew the replacement agreement. And of course since it&rsquo;s a gift card, I&rsquo;m limited to purchasing one that they sell from OfficeMax, which precludes me shopping around. Arrgh.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t a PDA last longer than 18 months? I&rsquo;m not really that hard on it. Maybe I just have bad luck with electronics.</p>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t written many (any?) posts on my first year&rsquo;s worth of experience as a parent&hellip; not sure why. But there was one little episode tonight that was too funny.</p>
<p>I was sitting at the dining room table, eating a late supper - a Whopper and fries from Burger King (yum yum). Laura was sitting under the table near my chair, begging french fries. I noticed as she was sitting there that there was a diaper sitting next to her on the floor; I assumed that it was one that she had pulled out of the diaper bag during one of her usual unload-the-whole-bag-on-the-floor sessions. So, I think nothing of it.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, we&rsquo;re about ready to go for a walk. Becky asked me how her diaper was, if she needed changed before the walk or not. So I reach down to feel her diaper&hellip;. and, lo and behold, she doesn&rsquo;t have a diaper on. Somehow, while wearing a shirt and overall shorts, she managed to get her diaper off and out of her clothes. I wish *I* were that coordinated. :-) She was having a great time, very comfortable. Thankfully we caught it in time, so there were no puddles (or worse) to clean up.</p>
<p>Just another adventure in parenting.</p>

			 <p>Today was the third and final day of the conference here in Norfolk. The conference itself was uneventful; heard a few presentations on the committees that are meeting to develop new guidelines for software certification. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d bore every single one of my readers if I actually described the details of the presentations, so I&rsquo;ll stop. :-)</p>
<p>After the conference, I walked over to St. Pauls Episcopal church, just a few blocks away. St. Paul&rsquo;s has met on that particular location since 1639. Parts of the current building date back to 1690 or so. There are a bunch of graves surrounding the church; some of those grave markers date back to the 1690&rsquo;s as well. It&rsquo;s quite a fascinating thing to visit a graveyard anywhere; but in the midwest the veteran markers we see usually commemorate WW I or WW II, or in rare cases the Civil War. In this graveyard there were several markers of folks who were Revolutionary War veterans. Too cool. There is also a small cannonball (it looked to be about grapefruit-sized) still embedded in the bricks of the building that was fired by the British back during the Revolutionary War. I love the east coast of the US for all the history. I can&rsquo;t imagine how blown-away I&rsquo;d be by European history if I ever get over there.</p>
<p>Did a bit of shopping after the church visit (hey, gotta pick up *something* for the wife and kiddo while I&rsquo;m here), ate dinner (Max &amp; Erma&rsquo;s again&hellip; tasty!) and headed back to the hotel for a soak in the hot tub and now Sportscenter on TV. Ah&hellip; nice to relax. Suppose I should turn it in now so I can get up early in the morning; oughtta be checked out of here by 7 or so for a 9:10 AM flight.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the report from Norfolk. I&rsquo;ll try to remember to post some pictures when I get back home.</p>

			 <p>Another day in Norfolk, more of the conference. Fun fun. Today was &ldquo;breakout sessions&rdquo;, which means they had 4 different sessions going at the same time on different topics. I attended mostly the &ldquo;policy and guidance&rdquo; sessions, which were an overview/intro to the tasks of a DER. Once again, they were mostly presented by engineers who apparently have lousy public speaking skills. I&rsquo;d better watch out; if I get a few years of DER experience under my belt, they&rsquo;ll start asking <em>me</em> to present!</p>
<p>The other thing that has surprised me a bit is just how small a community it is. The conference was limited to 300 participants; that is basically all of the software DERs in the country. For the most part, they&rsquo;ve been in these roles for a long time, so most everybody knows everybody. It will take a little bit of time for me to fit into and gain the respect of that group.</p>
<p>After the conference was over, I shelled out my $17 and took a 3-hour tour of the Norfolk harbor. It was pretty cool. We saw the huge container ships, a whole bunch of destroyers and missile boats, a few submarines (well, just the tops of the submarines), and then an aircraft carrier. The pictures don&rsquo;t do justice to just how immense that ship is.</p>
<p>Got back from the tour, had a late dinner at Joe&rsquo;s Crab Shack (I know, it&rsquo;s lousy chain food, but it was the closest restaurant to the hotel and I was tired and hungry), and then came back to my room and talked to Becky and then my folks on the phone. I should really be getting to bed&hellip; it&rsquo;s nearly 12:30 here. But I&rsquo;m still on CDT, which means it only feels like 11:30, which is about my normal bedtime. Oh well, the conference doesn&rsquo;t start until 8 in the morning, which will give me back my hour&hellip; unless I want breakfast. I haven&rsquo;t eaten a breakfast yet this week&hellip; slept through them all. Maybe tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Today was the first day of the DER software conference (excuse me, the official title is the &ldquo;FY2005 Software/Complex Electronic Hardware Standardization Conference&rdquo;) here in Norfolk, VA. (It&rsquo;s at the <a href="https://marriott.com/property/propertyPage.mi?marshaCode=ORFWS">Norfolk Waterside Marriott</a>, if you&rsquo;re really interested.) It started out pretty boring today. Most of today&rsquo;s topics were on the certification of Complex Electronic Hardware (i.e. FPGAs, ASICs, PLDs, etc). Since I&rsquo;m mainly a software guy, this hardware stuff wasn&rsquo;t that interesting.</p>
<p>I found that the other danger of having an engineering conference with presentations by engineers is that, for the most part, engineers have lousy public speaking skills. The one presentation I thought I&rsquo;d really be interested in was at the end of the day; the guy works for Honeywell (OK, they&rsquo;re my competitor, but I can forgive him that) and has been a DER for 15 years. He was giving &ldquo;perspectives on being a software DER&rdquo;. Now, I&rsquo;ll give him credit, the material was insightful. Unfortunately, his presentation skills were sub-par. He basically read/mumbled the content from his slides in such a quick, low tone that most of us wouldn&rsquo;t have understood him if it wasn&rsquo;t that the text were on the screen. Why is it that the good engineers can&rsquo;t have some social skills, too?</p>
<p>I wandered around the waterfront plaza here in Norfolk during the lunch hour. After the conference finished for the day, I jumped into that shiny gray Mustang (sweet rental car!) and headed out to Virginia Beach (about 15 minutes away). I&rsquo;d never been to the Atlantic Ocean before. I found an empty spot on the beach (a tough trick when it&rsquo;s 100+ degrees outside) and just sat and absorbed for a while. There&rsquo;s just something incredible about the ocean; the immenseness of it all, I suppose. The continual pounding of the waves, nothing but water as far as the eye can see; the knowledge that if you head out that direction, the next land you&rsquo;ll come to is Europe.</p>
<p>Back to the hotel to get cleaned up, then I walked over to a restaurant called <a href="http://www.maxandermas.com/">Max &amp; Erma&rsquo;s</a> for a late supper. It was nearly 9:00, and the place was pretty empty. I had just talked to Becky on the phone and was feeling kinda lonely sitting in a booth all by myself staring out the window at the cars on the street. On the upside, though, I had one of the nicest servers I&rsquo;ve ever had; she was very friendly, service was excellent. I ordered the &ldquo;Garbage Burger&rdquo;, which came with Bacon, 4 kinds of cheese (American, Cheddar, Swiss, Mozzarella), onions, mushrooms, guacamole and marinara. It was <em>tasty</em>. It was nice to walk the 4 blocks back to the hotel; unfortunately, it was so swelteringly hot that I wasn&rsquo;t motivated to walk any further.</p>
<p>The one task I should still complete tonight is to prepare some slides for Sunday; I&rsquo;m teaching Sunday School, and we&rsquo;re discussing stem cell research. I think I pretty much know what I want to say, I just have to get it compiled and put some pretty slides together. But I know how to do that. :-)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m writing tonight from a hotel room in Norfolk, VA&hellip; I&rsquo;m here to attend the 2005 FAA Software DER conference. I&rsquo;m not actually a DER yet, but have applied to be one and my company figured it would be good if I came and got some training.</p>
<p>So far the trip has been uneventful; flew from Cedar Rapids to Detroit and then on to Norfolk. I&rsquo;d never been through Detroit before; it&rsquo;s a pretty nice airport. The tunnel between Concourse B (where I landed) and Concourse A (where I needed to go to catch my next flight) was pretty wild; the tunnel walls/roof had funky psychedelic colors that semi-randomly changed&hellip; would&rsquo;ve taken a picture if I hadn&rsquo;t put the camera in my checked luggage&hellip; :-(</p>
<p>Got to Norfolk and was pleasantly surprised at my rental car; it&rsquo;s a silver 2005 Ford Mustang. Pretty cool. Managed to find the hotel, the Marriott Waterfront hotel, very nice. It has a view that overlooks the Elizabeth River and just around the corner is an old battleship that&rsquo;s part of a museum. I&rsquo;ll have to take some pictures tomorrow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little bit lonely and quiet right now. I haven&rsquo;t met up with any of the others from Cedar Rapids yet; I&rsquo;ll have to find them in the morning. So, I&rsquo;m sitting in my hotel room, just finished ironing all the clothes I brought along, thinking it&rsquo;s probably time to head to bed. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m still on central time, which means it only feels like 10:30 PM but the clock says 11:30. Oh well.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the web tells me that the Cubs came back to win in the 9th inning, 3-2. Go Cubbies!</p>

			 <p>Tuesday I found a bootleg concert recording of <a href="http://www.randallgoodgame.com">Randall Goodgame</a> opening for <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a> in Minot, ND. I&rsquo;d never heard his music before; I knew that he&rsquo;s written some good stuff for Caedmon&rsquo;s, and that <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.net/osenga/">Andy Osenga</a> speaks highly of him, but that was about it. So, I downloaded the songs and decided to give him a listen. Wow, what I have been missing!</p>
<p><img src="https://cjhubbs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/7812384db8.jpg" alt="War And Peace cover image"></p>
<p>The song that has totally captured my head at the moment is from his Peanuts trilogy on his latest album, War and Peace. I&rsquo;m not sure whether it&rsquo;s #1 or #3; the bootleg says it&rsquo;s #3, but when I listen to the clips of his songs from his website, it sounds like it&rsquo;s #1. I guess I&rsquo;ll find out for sure once I get the CD; I ordered it back on Tuesday. Hoping it might come before I head out to Norfolk next week, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath. Anyhow, he has Danielle Young (of Caedmon&rsquo;s) singing with him on this one, and it&rsquo;s just the perfect folksy mix of terrific lyrics and fun music; I&rsquo;ve had it on repeat for the last hour or so in iTunes and I&rsquo;m not ready to turn it off yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He [Schroeder] played like Harry Truman, without those cokebottles that only Marcie wore, Like Harry Truman, without the atom bomb, Without the burden of a third world war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.</p>

			 <p>It has been one of those summers at church. We had a leadership meeting last night (to review: I am the worship leader and an elder apprentice) where we started through everything&hellip; it went all evening. Just a thumbnail sketch:</p>
<ol>
<li>We&rsquo;re going to a two service format starting in September. This will of course require extra organization and willingness to change from everyone involved.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re eliminating our adult Sunday School classes in favor of 8-week weeknight courses to be held off-campus, at coffeeshops and the like. The goal is to get folks to bring unbelieving friends, and for the unbelievers to have a more comfortable place to come and discuss the Bible. Adult SS attendance has been waning, so it&rsquo;s a good time to change.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re starting up a ministry with a focus on the arts - drama, music, film, etc. Fortunately I&rsquo;ve managed to stay out of any responsibilities with this one so far. Hope it stays that way - I just don&rsquo;t have the time.</li>
<li>Our youth pastor is moving from full-time youth pastor to part-time associate pastor. He has sensed a calling away from youth ministry, but wants to stay on somehow, and we want to keep him. To go along with that&hellip;</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re going to hire a new part-time youth pastor. At the moment, our #1 candidate is the senior pastor&rsquo;s son. We&rsquo;re hoping this doesn&rsquo;t cause too much controversy. I think personally he&rsquo;s the right man for the job.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re going to change the name of the church. <a href="/05/06/whats-in-a-name/">I&rsquo;ve talked about this before.</a> We know we should change to remove any hindrance that the word &lsquo;Baptist&rsquo; causes&hellip; but it&rsquo;s hard for some of the old-timers to want to change.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to remember in the end that ultimately, it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s church, and He will have to work His will in everything we do. He will get done exactly what He wants to get done&hellip; we just have to make sure we don&rsquo;t make hindrances and slip the schedule by months or years. Such is the lesson for today. :-)</p>

			 <p><em>I don&rsquo;t know what triggered this memory today&hellip; but I might as well tell the story while I&rsquo;m thinking about it.</em></p>
<p>I was in my third year at <a href="http://www.letu.edu">LeTU</a> when I got asked to be the pianist for some special music during chapel. Now, this was not an unusual request; by this time in my college life I had become the <em>de facto</em> college pianist, doing lots of special music, I was lead accompianist for the singing group, etc. On this particular day, though, the musical content was going to be a bit different.</p>
<p>My friend Mark Holmes, a phenomenal tenor in the Singers, was slated to do a special, and he was having a hard time deciding what to do. Finally, in a move worthy of a bad college movie somewhere, he chose to sing a &ldquo;Christianized&rdquo; version of the classic <em>Johnny B. Goode</em>. As I recall, the lyrics were totally cheesy; the chorus ended &ldquo;go, Johnny, go - go preach the Word.&rdquo; Yikes.</p>
<p>So anyhow, I had been recruited to play the piano to back him up; we also had a good drummer, a bass player whose name eludes me, and then Fred playing the guitar. Fred was a couple years behind me; he was tall and redheaded, with a beard and ponytail completing his wanna-be rock star image. He was pretty much a goofball when it came to music, which made him fun. He was thrilled to have the opportunity to prove his electric guitar prowess on this dubious semi-cover, and so our band was complete. We practiced a few times, and got it polished enough to be acceptable at the musical abyss that was LeTourneau.</p>
<p>The morning came for chapel and we were slated to do special music right before the message. We revved it up and did an energetic (if not totally polished) rendition, just as we had practiced. What I had not practiced, however, was coming down on a <em>glissando</em> down the keyboard (that sweeping motion where you just run the back of your fingers down the keyboard) and hit a black key the wrong way, and, lo and behold, the black part of the key just broke off. I&rsquo;ve never seen it happen before or since. The wood was probably kinda soft in that key, and I just torqued it the right way. It&rsquo;s the only time (to my knowledge) that I&rsquo;ve ever caused damage to a piano by playing it.</p>
<p>When we were packing up our gear after chapel, I picked up the key and tossed it over to Fred. You&rsquo;d think he had died and gone to rock-n-roll heaven - he thought it was the most cool thing that somebody had broken a <em>piano</em> while playing a song. I think every time we did music for chapel after that the subject came up, always with amazement and laughter. Fortunately for me, a little bit of Elmer&rsquo;s wood glue was sufficient to fix the piano so the next pianist in line could have their E-flat.</p>
<p>The epilogue to this story is the memory that this wasn&rsquo;t the last time I played <em>Johnny B. Goode</em> in chapel. A year or so later, an instructor at the school (also a talented guitarist, now a co-worker here in Iowa) was up for special music, and he chose to do Johnny B. again. <em>He</em> did the original version, complete with the word &ldquo;hell&rdquo;, which raised a few of the stodgy faculty eyebrows. :-) He introduced the song this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last week, a Romanian choir came and sang some traditional songs from their homeland. This morning, I&rsquo;d like to sing a traditional song from <em>my</em> homeland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, I managed to keep the piano in one piece.</p>

			 <p>Last night we had a babysitter available and so we went to the <a href="http://www.collinsroadtheatres.com/">cheap seats theater in town</a> and watched <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0318649/">Sahara</a>. It is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Clive Cussler. Becky and I are both huge fans of Cussler&rsquo;s Dirk Pitt series, so we were looking forward to seeing what they&rsquo;d do with his novel in the movie.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s beyond me why they haven&rsquo;t tried to translate more of the Dirk Pitt series onto the big screen; for swashbuckling adventure tales, they&rsquo;re tops. (The one attempt thus far, <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0081400/">Raise the Titanic!</a></em> may have discouraged others from trying&hellip; it was horrible!) Perhaps it&rsquo;s the slight lack of realism&hellip; but wait, we&rsquo;re talking about Hollywood here. Part of what makes Cussler&rsquo;s books so fun, IMHO, is that if the hero is on a quest to find some mysterious hidden treasure, <em>he finds it.</em> None of this &ldquo;oh it didn&rsquo;t really exist at all but at least you had a good adventure&rdquo; type of ending for Mr. Cussler. Nosirree. The hero gets the girl, drives a cool old car, wisecracks with his trusty sidekick, saves the world, and finds his treasure to boot. Realism? Who needs realism?</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t so sure about the casting of <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/">Matthew McConaughey</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0001872/">Steve Zahn</a> as Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino. Fortunately, they suprised me. McConaughey was excellent, and they captured the fun-loving spirit and wise-cracking nature of the two characters really well. They interacted as though they had been friends for their whole lives (which, in the books they have been). My only gripe was that Zahn&rsquo;s character was too dumb most of the time. I realize Steve Zahn has made a career out of playing &ldquo;hi, I&rsquo;m a doofus&rdquo; characters. I wish they could have made him just a bit more heroic; in the books Al Giordino is just as much a thinker as Pitt; just with a different personality. That didn&rsquo;t come through so well in the movie.</p>
<p>At the end, Becky asked &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the Clive Cussler cameo?&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve read any of the books, you know that Cussler writes himself in with a small cameo appearance in every book. (Becky likened this to Hitchcock&rsquo;s appearances in each of his movies.) It&rsquo;s another one of those things that makes Dirk Pitt novels so much fun - when is Cussler going to appear? It would have been a neat nod to the books if they had written it in somehow&hellip; but it was not to be. I guess they can only base so much on the book.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a fun night out. And it was only Thursday. That almost makes it feel like a longer weekend, if it just wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that I&rsquo;m working today&hellip; :-)</p>

			 <p>Normally I don&rsquo;t do a lot of &ldquo;here&rsquo;s what I did with my weekend&rdquo;-type posts, but it was a nice weekend, so since I need to update the blog I figured I&rsquo;d just have to. Oh, first things first: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/StAndrean">my brother Ryan</a> has decided to start a blog. Don&rsquo;t know how much he&rsquo;ll maintain it, but I&rsquo;ve added it to the list of links on the right.</p>
<p>Anyhow, to the weekend. Friday night we got a babysitter and went out on a date. Nice to have some time to just be with the two of us after a busy week. We went to <a href="http://www.chilis.com">Chili&rsquo;s</a> and had ribs for supper, then went to <a href="http://www.bn.com">Barnes &amp; Noble</a> to browse for a while. I bought a 2-disk CD album of <a href="http://www.monkzone.com">Thelonious Monk</a> and his quartet, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000062F9/qid=1120589683/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/103-5584203-4239818?v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846">Live at the &ldquo;It&rdquo; Club</a></em>. I&rsquo;d not listened to any Monk before, but a friend recommended him because of my love for <a href="http://www.harryconnickjr.com">Harry Connick, Jr</a>. I was not disappointed. 2 1/2 hours of live club performance from 1964, digitally remastered so that it sounds great. I&rsquo;ve been listening to it for the past couple evenings and it&rsquo;s excellent. Forgot to bring it to work today so I guess it won&rsquo;t make its way onto my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> until tomorrow. So, after <a href="http://www.bn.com">B&amp;N</a>, we went down to our <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">favorite little coffeeshop</a> and each had a cappucino smoothie. I sat and improvised on the piano for a while and Becky sat and read a book. What a nice way to spend a Friday evening!</p>
<p>Saturday we got up early and worked on an outdoor construction project. Becky has been planning on building some planters back behind the garage for the past several months; the landscape timbers to build said planters have been sitting on our patio for the past 6 weeks or so. Finally we had a free weekend to build. Finished those up by early afternoon. They will be really nice to have.</p>
<p>With the long weekend we got to enjoy Monday off as well. We did a bunch of cleanup in the morning, in preparation for having several friends over in the afternoon. It rained non-stop from 9:00 until 1:30 or so; we were afraid it might be too wet to spend time outside, but no, it dried out nicely and was beautiful. We invited Steve &amp; Amanda and their kids, Ginger came as well (Daniel&rsquo;s off to Amsterdam today flying freight), and then a new couple that just moved up here, Jeremiah and Rebecca. We had a great time getting to know them - they seem like a lot of fun, hope we can get to know them better. What I wouldn&rsquo;t give to have them end up making <a href="http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org">Noelridge</a> their church home&hellip; but they&rsquo;re looking for a home in Monticello (30 minutes away) to shorten Jeremiah&rsquo;s commute, so I wouldn&rsquo;t place good odds on them coming to CR for church&hellip; oh well.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s Tuesday and I&rsquo;m back at work. I&rsquo;ve got a project certification plan document to update today. Fun fun. But it was a great, refreshing weekend. Thank the Lord for these times to kick back a bit and relax.</p>

			 <p>Thursday morning I had the delightful experience of having 4 wisdom teeth removed. It&rsquo;s the first real dental work I&rsquo;ve ever had to have done, so I wasn&rsquo;t really looking forward to it. But they needed to be removed, so I dutifully reported to the oral surgeon&rsquo;s office at 8 AM, prepared for a weekend of pain and pills.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually been a lot better than I feared it would be. Thursday was still pretty much a loss, but I wasn&rsquo;t in a lot of pain. Friday I felt pretty good. I probably could&rsquo;ve gone to work on Friday, but I&rsquo;d already prepared everybody for my being gone, so why mess things up for them? :-) It&rsquo;s now Saturday morning, and my mouth is still pretty swollen, but I keep popping the ibuprofen, and other than that the pain is mostly gone. I&rsquo;ll have to be careful what I eat for the next several days, but I can live with that.</p>
<p>The only thing I really needed to get done this weekend was mow the lawn, and so I&rsquo;ve been figuring that by today I&rsquo;d be ready to get out and mow. Well of course last night it had to rain, and it&rsquo;s been threatening rain all morning, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to get it done. Maybe tomorrow. I guess I could go outside and help Becky with her flowers&hellip;</p>
<p>This is probably the most boring random journal-type blog entry I&rsquo;ve written in some time, but I guess it&rsquo;s been slow enough that I don&rsquo;t have much to post about. Either that or I&rsquo;m just slow enough that I can&rsquo;t think of anything&hellip; :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a comment sometime back, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=amburgler7">Amber</a> asked about the whole House of Cakeboy title. While I may rename this blog at some time in the future, it&rsquo;s still worth telling a bit of the cakeboy story by way of explanation.</p>
<p>It all goes back to a choir tour back in college. I was the primary accompanist for the <a href="http://www.letu.edu">LeTourneau</a> Singers, who toured during spring and fall breaks with about 18 members, including accompanists and sound guys. We toured to Colorado during spring break during my freshman year, and, as it usually did, my birthday (March 14th) fell during the tour. We were out for dinner at a Mexican restaurant that night for my birthday, and after eating, they brought out a cake that somebody had bought, and sang Happy Birthday, and everything. It really was sweet of them.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after several pieces of cake had been cut and I had started eating mine, one of the girls (one of the semi-obnoxious ones) grabbed a bunch of the frosting from the cake plate, snuck up behind me, and proceeded to smear the frosting all over my face, in my hair, the whole nine yards. I was a mess, and none to happy about it, either. But I maintained my good humor, and cleaned up as well as a handful of napkins would allow. She then proceeded to call me &ldquo;cake boy&rdquo; the whole rest of the evening&hellip; which grew into the whole rest of the tour. Several other group members picked it up and it became my de facto nickname for the rest of the tour. When we went skiing later in the week, I had a tag to mark my skis, and marked it &ldquo;cake boy&rdquo;. I still have it laying around the house somewhere&hellip; a memory of good times. But that skiing trip is a whole different story.</p>
<p>After Singers (which I quit after my sophomore year), cakeboy started to fade into the oblivion of long-forgotten days. Some years later, I began interacting on an <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/index.php">internet forum</a> hosted by and for fans of the band <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a>. I wanted a cool nickname, not just something boring like my computer login name. So I thought for a few minutes&hellip; let&rsquo;s see&hellip; what could I use for a unique nickname? And then I remembered that ski tag. So, Cakeboy it was. Little did I know the fun that I was in for.</p>
<p>You see, on this particular message board, when they refer to sex, they don&rsquo;t typically say &ldquo;sex&rdquo; - their pseudonym for sex is &ldquo;cake&rdquo;. Unfortunately for me, I didn&rsquo;t realize this yet at the time I chose the nickname. You can imagine the jokes that came up. Actually, you don&rsquo;t have to imagine - read the <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/index.php/topic,23646.0.html">&ldquo;Cakeboy joins the throng&rdquo; thread</a> and see for yourself. Finally <a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=407">one member</a> took pity on me and let me in on the joke, but after a bit of thought I decided I could laugh at myself just fine, and so I kept the nickname. It&rsquo;s been a perpetual joke ever since, but I&rsquo;m OK with that.</p>
<p>So that brings us to the House of Cakeboy. It seemed the reasonable name for my blog when I got it started. I suppose sooner or later I&rsquo;ll change it to something that won&rsquo;t make people go &ldquo;&lsquo;House of Cakeboy&rsquo;? What the heck?&rdquo; But for now, it&rsquo;s a fun story to tell. Hope you enjoyed it.</p>

			 <p>I have set upon a new endeavor at work: I am applying to become a DER. A brief explanation is in order, since probably none of my readers are familiar with the avionics industry and how equipment is approved to go on airplanes.</p>
<p>In the USA, the <a href="http://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) has to approve every piece of equipment that goes on an airplane. The idea is that they can ensure that all aircraft are, by design, safe and airworthy. For software that runs on equipment in the aircraft, that software must be developed with rigorous standards and procedures, and then verified with equal rigor. (The relative rigor of the standards depends also on how critical the equipment is - less critical equipment needs less rigorous procedure and test.) Just for my company (one of the top two or three avionics suppliers in the world), and just in my department (flight displays), we probably request certification for half a dozen software releases every year.</p>
<p>The FAA realizes that they don&rsquo;t have enough people to review every package in detail, nor do they have the time to stay current on all the new technologies and designs and processes. So, they choose to appoint engineers within the avionics companies as &ldquo;designated engineering representatives&rdquo; (DERs), and they give those engineers the authority to review and sign off on software releases on behalf of the FAA.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m applying to become a software DER. There are only about a dozen of them in our company (out of 10,000+ employees), and half of those dozen reach retirement age in the next 5 years. So, the need is great. I&rsquo;m kind of at the bottom end of the experience required; counting my college training, I have 10 years of software experience - a minimum of 8 are required. I submitted my application packet yesterday. I will be going to a national DER conference in Norfolk, VA at the end of July, which should provide me with some valuable training. Then I will be studying the federal regulations like mad in preparation for a 30 minute panel examination by the FAA, likely to be scheduled for the end of September.</p>
<p>It will be a good move to become a DER; first of all, it&rsquo;ll provide some variety in my work since I&rsquo;ll be doing the DER stuff about 20% of the time, and my usual job the other 80%. It&rsquo;ll give me visibility to other projects and other types of equipment that I might not learn about otherwise. It&rsquo;ll make me just a little bit more indispensable, I suppose&hellip; and indispensable is a good thing to be.</p>
<p>I imagine I will post about my learning experiences here from time to time, so stay tuned.</p>

			 <p>As I noted in <a href="/05/06/mr-murphy-works-on-sundays/">my post to Mr. Murphy</a> a week or so ago, I&rsquo;ve been having problems with the new projector at church. I talked to the tech support guy today and we walked through stuff for 15 minutes, and he couldn&rsquo;t figure anything out either. He left me with two other things to try, and if neither of them worked, then we&rsquo;d send the thing back for warranty repair.</p>
<p>I tried the first, which was to send a composite video signal through. It worked just fine. So then I tried the second, which entailed getting the projector down from its stand and taking it into the office to hook it up directly to a desktop PC. Still no dice. At this point I&rsquo;m pretty frustrated, and just sitting there thinking about what else it could be. I idly started playing with the rotary input control on the top of the projector, and all of a sudden - voila! It&rsquo;s working! What could it have been?</p>
<p>The whole time I have been pushing the VIDEO button on the remote control, trying to cycle through composite video, S-video, and BNC. What I hadn&rsquo;t been doing is pushing the RGB button right next to it. Arrrgh. As soon as I push that button, it switches to the RGB source, and everything works fine.</p>
<p>I should have my geek status revoked for a week or two for this one.</p>
<p>[Note to tech support: even if the guy on the other end sounds smart, don&rsquo;t assume that he is. Remember that there&rsquo;s a RGB button on the remote, and ask specifically if he&rsquo;s using it. Even smart-sounding guys can overlook obvious stuff when it&rsquo;s a new piece of equipment.]</p>

			 <p>Becky went to a women&rsquo;s retreat this weekend. She left Friday afternoon and didn&rsquo;t get back until Saturday night. It was my first real extended time of getting to &ldquo;kid wrangle&rdquo;, as Steve puts it. (Of course, he&rsquo;s got three kids, so my one probably doesn&rsquo;t really count&hellip;) I have gained an entirely new appreciation for the things my wife deals with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I had 28-or-so hours that Becky was gone, and had one real task I needed to complete: the back yard needed mowed. That was just about all I got done while she was gone. Well, not quite all. I did get over to church to finish debugging the problems with the projector&hellip; and didn&rsquo;t get anywhere. I&rsquo;ll talk through it with tech support today. And I did spend a couple hours while she was napping Saturday afternoon watching the Cubs game. So I could have gotten a couple other things done. But still.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this whole issue of how much stuff there is to remember with a kid; you have to remember to take the diaper bag everywhere, and to remember to refill it when it&rsquo;s empty. And remembering to check (and change) her diaper often enough that she&rsquo;s comfortable and not overflowing&hellip; And remembering to take the opportunity to change her diaper at the &ldquo;family room&rdquo; on the one end of the mall before walking all the way to the other end. And remembering to use the facilities before you leave home since it&rsquo;s a real pain to try to park a stroller in the restroom next to you when you&rsquo;re out&hellip; And remembering that mealtimes aren&rsquo;t nearly so flexible for Laura as they are for me&hellip; 7, noon, and 5 are pretty well set in stone. And on&hellip; and on&hellip; I assume you&rsquo;re getting the idea.</p>
<p>Laura and I had a good time while Becky was gone; we spent a lot of time together, and that&rsquo;s good. I don&rsquo;t get to spend as much time with her as I&rsquo;d like to. But I&rsquo;ll tell you this - we were both sure glad to see her get home. :-)</p>

			 <p>This has definitely been one of those boring weeks, especially as far as work is concerned. <a href="/05/05/here-goes-nothin/">As I wrote about before</a>, I have been assigned to be the team lead for a new project. It&rsquo;s not a particularly big or long project as our projects go, probably me and one other software person for 12 months. It&rsquo;s becoming less scary as I get into it further; I&rsquo;m understanding exactly what needs done, and I know I can handle it&hellip; I&rsquo;ve done most all of it before.</p>
<p>The bad part this week is the boredom; we&rsquo;re in a planning phase where our plan isn&rsquo;t due until the end of this month. My project lead was on vacation all of this week and will be all of next week, too. I need her input to finish planning. So what do I get in the mean time? I have a bunch of half-finished spreadsheets that need her input and approval before I can finish them. I&rsquo;ve had most of those done since the early part of this week. So I&rsquo;m sitting here now posting on my blog, inflicting my boredom on you readers who are probably now bored reading this.</p>
<p>I hate having nothing to do. If I have tasks to work on, I&rsquo;m a happy camper, the day goes fast, I&rsquo;m ultra-productive, things are good. When I don&rsquo;t have stuff to do, I go crazy. Time drags. Listening to music doesn&rsquo;t seem to help. I can&rsquo;t exactly sit here and read a book&hellip; although maybe there are some technical journals or FAA publications or something that I can read. Yeah, that&rsquo;d be exciting. :-)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know if I feel better after having complained here about my boredom&hellip; but it least I spent 5 minutes doing it&hellip; less than three hours until the workday is over&hellip;.</p>

<p>This life, therefore, is not righteousness but growth in righteousness, not health but healing, not being but becoming, not rest but exercise. We are not yet what we shall be, but we are growing toward it. The process is not yet finished, but it is going on. This is not the end but it is the road.

			 <p>We&rsquo;re holding some church leadership strategy meetings this summer, and one of the big topics is the proposal that we change the name of our church. It&rsquo;s a big step - we&rsquo;ve been <a href="http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org">Noelridge Baptist Church</a> for almost 50 years. But the times, they are a-changin'. The denomination with which we&rsquo;re loosely affiliated (Conservative Baptist Int&rsquo;l, &lsquo;CBI&rsquo;) has mulled over a name change for the last year or so and settled on WorldVenture. The rationale for the name change is that when you poll the population at large and ask for church-name-type words with bad connotations, right at the top of the list are both &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; and &ldquo;baptist&rdquo;. Two strikes against you before you even get started. We have discussed it for a while and decided that Baptist has got to go. But what will we change it to?</p>
<p>Our leadership group at these meetings is comprised of eight of us: our four elders (two of whom are the staff pastors), two elder apprentices (of which I am one), the chair of the deacons (my friend Steve), and the chair of the deaconesses (my wife). (Did I mention we&rsquo;re a little bit involved in our church? :-) ) Anyhow, our group is pretty well split on naming philosophies right now. Our senior pastor (by far the dynamic leader of the group) is in favor of something more seeker-friendly, and is a big fan of something perhaps in Latin that will pique the interest of seekers. (Think of <a href="http://www.imagodeicommunity.com/">Imago Dei</a> in Portland, for an example.) I think that both of us apprentices and probably the elder chair would go for that.</p>
<p>But then there&rsquo;s the other side. Steve and John (the youth pastor) and Becky are all on the opposite side, thinking that a &ldquo;foreign-sounding&rdquo; name will just turn people off; that they&rsquo;ll go &ldquo;huh? what&rsquo;s that? can&rsquo;t even pronounce it!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;ll be it. John (I love ya', bro) likes to play the stupid card: &ldquo;well you guys may be rocket scientists, but I&rsquo;m just a simple guy and I wouldn&rsquo;t even know how to spell it if you told it to me&hellip;&rdquo; It drives me nuts sometimes. He&rsquo;s not that simple. :-) Anyway, their vote would be for something simpler, like &ldquo;Peace Church&rdquo; or &ldquo;Potter&rsquo;s Clay Community&rdquo;. Sure, the names are simpler, but to me they don&rsquo;t inspire the awe or interest that some other type of name would.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s our dilemma. We will be making a change, but to what? Do you, the reader, have any ideas? Here&rsquo;s the list of everything that was proposed yesterday at our meeting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peace Church</li>
<li>Peace Community</li>
<li>All Souls Church</li>
<li>All Souls Community Church</li>
<li>Last Baptist Church</li>
<li>Community of Faith</li>
<li>Glory of God Community</li>
<li>Image of God Community</li>
<li>Potter’s Clay Community</li>
<li>Last Chance Church</li>
<li>Last Stop Church</li>
<li>Noelridge Church</li>
<li>Gratia Dei Church</li>
<li>Charis Deo Church</li>
<li>Pax Dei Community</li>
<li>Imago Christi Community</li>
</ul>
<p>Do any of them strike you as good or bad? I&rsquo;ll take all of the input I can get.</p>

			 <p>Mr. Murphy and his dang-blasted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">law</a> were working busily yesterday. It was certainly one of those mornings.</p>
<p>It started off innocently enough, just another Sunday morning, with its usual hassles. It didn&rsquo;t really start to go downhill until about 10:15, when I was trying to fit the pastor with the new <a href="http://www.countryman.com/html_data_sheets/e6data.html">earpiece microphone</a>. It&rsquo;s supposed to bend to fit to your ear. It bent just a little, and then&hellip; *snap*. It just broke in two. We&rsquo;re talking a $400 microphone here. It&rsquo;s still under warranty, so I&rsquo;m hopefully they&rsquo;ll replace it. It shouldn&rsquo;t just snap like that. We switched the pastor to the regular lapel mic and that went OK.</p>
<p>So then I ran back into the sanctuary to hook up the laptop to the new projector (which we used for the first time last week) to show some announcements before the service started and then to run the slides for our song lyrics. First, I couldn&rsquo;t turn on the projector until Sunday School (which meets in the sanctuary during the summer) was over&hellip; and it ran late, didn&rsquo;t end until 10:28 for a 10:30 service. So finally I turn it on, only to read with with horrified eyes, &ldquo;NO VIDEO SIGNAL DETECTED&rdquo;. Arrrgh. No time to debug, gotta switch to plan B. Fortunately the old overhead projector was still sitting in the back of the room, under the coat rack.</p>
<p>Sam was kind enough to grab it for me so I could go start my piano prelude. He also pulled the overheads for the songs we were singing. Becky agreed to run the overheads for me. We got the service started about 5 minutes late. When we finally got to the singing portion, the second song was supposed to be <em>Open the Eyes of my Heart</em>. I&rsquo;m in my usual tuned-out, eyes-closed mode. After singing the first couple lines, I look up at the screen to see it&hellip; blank. I look over at Becky and see a helpless look on her face - Sam had mistakenly pulled the overhead for <em>Open Our Eyes</em> instead of <em>Open the eyes&hellip;</em>. I kinda stopped mid-song and apologized. But folks know the song, and were singing pretty well, so we just continued <em>sans</em> lyrics. I think it ended up working OK but I was so dang frustrated it didn&rsquo;t really matter to me at that point.</p>
<p>I pulled out the ladder afterwards to check out the projector and I still don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s not working. I tried a different laptop, but still no signal detected. Today I&rsquo;m going to try a different monitor cable and see if that&rsquo;s the issue. There&rsquo;s not that many links in the chain, so I should be able to localize it&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;oh, and next time, Mr. Murphy? Take Sunday off.</p>

			 <p>So, it' 8:30 on Saturday morning and I&rsquo;m sitting here in the dining room watching Laura finish her breakfast. Her normal schedule is 16 oz of formula in the morning, but she&rsquo;s drinking out of a 7 oz bottle. That means the real trick for mom and dad is to notice when the bottle&rsquo;s getting empty so we can refill it before she throws it on the floor. Then she&rsquo;ll eat her Cheerios, so I guess she&rsquo;s doing like I do and having her bowl of cereal in the morning, she&rsquo;s just having it separately whereas I put my milk and Cheerios together. :-)</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s going to be a fairly slow Saturday, which will be nice. Just some odd tasks to complete around the house, and I need to go to the music store and buy a new microphone boom since mine at church has totally stripped out and won&rsquo;t hold my mic up. Oh, and I have to type up the powerpoint slides for tomorrow&rsquo;s church service&hellip;. such are the hazards of getting a new projector.</p>
<p>Well Becky just got up now so I suppose that means it&rsquo;s time for the day to start. Thank God for weekends. :-)</p>

			 <p>Within the last 7 days I&rsquo;ve heard three separate sermons from the same passage. This doesn&rsquo;t happen all the time. Well, for starters, usually I don&rsquo;t even hear three sermons in a week. But the Moody conference last week gave me 12 general session messages to choose from. And when I get three in the same week, I think it&rsquo;s time that I sit up and listen a little more closely.</p>
<p>The third sermon of the bunch was from a guest speaker at our church on Sunday. It honestly wasn&rsquo;t even that interesting, was pretty shallow. But, it got me turned back to that passage. The other two messages were from D. A. Carson and Tony Evans. Now those will get your attention. :-)</p>
<p>The passage in question is Ephesians 3:14-21:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith&ndash;that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tony Evans laid it out this way: Paul is praying for us to have more intimacy with Christ. Intimacy provides capacity, and the capacity provides power - God&rsquo;s power. In other words, if we are lacking intimacy with Christ, our capacity for God to work in our lives is diminished. On the other hand, if we pursue intimacy with Christ, our capacity for God to work in our lives is increased, &ldquo;more abundantly than all we ask or think&rdquo;.</p>
<p>D. A. Carson, though, had the illustration while teaching this passage that will stick with me the longest. His question was this: why does Paul pray that &ldquo;Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith&rdquo; when he&rsquo;s talking to Christians, who presumably already have Christ in their life? He told this story, which I&rsquo;ll paraphrase in the first person:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my wife and I bought our first house, it was what they call a &ldquo;handyman&rsquo;s dream&rdquo;. You know what that means&hellip; it needed a lot of work. There was black and silver wallpaper in the bedroom. The previous owners had two dogs who were rarely let out - there was still dog poo in the corners of the house. The walls were dingy. It needed lots and lots of work. When we bought the house and moved our stuff in, it was ours, we lived there, but we didn&rsquo;t really <em>inhabit</em> the place yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as we continued to live there, we starting working on the house. We knocked down a wall to expand the kitchen. We painted. We took down the black and silver wallpaper. We cleaned up the dog poo. Had we stayed there longer, we undoubtedly would have built on an addition when the kids were born. After some period of time, we could step back, look at the house, and say, &lsquo;wow, we really live here.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, Dr. Carson says, is the difference Paul is talking about in Ephesians 3. When we first accept Christ, our lives are a lot like that handyman&rsquo;s dream house. There&rsquo;s black and silver wallpaper on the walls. There&rsquo;s dog poo in the corners. (&ldquo;Dog poo&rdquo; is an exact quote from Carson, by the way. :-)) Christ is living there, but He doesn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;inhabit&rdquo; the place in the way that Paul means. What God wants to do is to clean us up, to do that painting, take down the wallpaper, and remodel the place so that our Christ is really <em>inhabiting</em> our lives.</p>
<p>This illustration was the most striking, insightful picture to me from the whole conference. I want to let Christ continue transforming my life, until it just radiates from me that &ldquo;Christ lives here&rdquo;. With three sermons in a week, I think God was trying to tell me something. I hope I&rsquo;m paying enough attention.</p>

			 <p>You gotta love the Chicago Cubs. They brought a guy up from Triple-A to start last night&rsquo;s game against the Dodgers, and he gets a win in his first major league start. He was the tenth different starting pitcher the Cubs have used already this season, and we&rsquo;re only two months in!</p>
<p>For as miserable as the season has seemed at times so far, the Cubs are 3 games over .500, in second place in the NL Central (6.5 games back), have the league&rsquo;s leading hitter in average, (tied for the lead in) HRs, and RBIs (Derrek Lee), and have managed to bang out 6 wins in a row, including a series sweep of the Dodgers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy Cubs fan this morning. :-)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>And so today the <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff/journal/2005/06/01/musical-baton/">musical baton was passed to me</a> by <a href="http://thedirtroad.net/jeff">Jeff Holland</a>. It seems like a fun idea, but it will be agonizing to have to make some of these choices&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Amount of music on your computer?</strong></p>
<p>OK, this one is easy, thanks to iTunes. 4123 songs, 12.8 days, 15.03 GB. That&rsquo;s basically my entire collection - now how much of it I regularly listen to is an entirely separate question - it would be a much shorter list. The total list is bloated by a bunch of classical stuff and then my wife&rsquo;s albums (things like the entire collected works of Jim Brickman, Best of Air Supply, other stuff to scary to admit is on there&hellip;)</p>
<p><strong>Currently listening to?</strong></p>
<p><em>Hurry</em>, Sleeping at Last, <em>Ghosts</em></p>
<p><strong>Five songs that mean a lot to you?</strong></p>
<p><em>Wedding Dress</em>, <a href="http://derekwebb.com">Derek Webb</a> This springs to mind almost instantly; to me it embodies that spirit of brokenness and repentance that I constantly need to have before God.</p>
<p><em>Somewhere North of Here</em>, <a href="http://caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a> (Derek Webb :-)) One of my favorite CC songs, one of the early ones that hooked me.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many others that come to mind, so let&rsquo;s see what iTunes says I&rsquo;ve been listening to&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Don&rsquo;t Think Twice, It&rsquo;s Alright</em>, <a href="http://bobdylan.com">Bob Dylan</a> I was introduced to this song by <a href="http://www.billyheller.com/">a guy I know</a> who sings in <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com">my favorite coffeeshop</a>. It&rsquo;s good, simple, early Dylan.</p>
<p><em>Say</em>, <a href="http://www.sleepingatlast.com">Sleeping At Last</a> Not necessarily even my favorite Sleeping At Last song (that probably goes to <em>Currents</em>, but it&rsquo;s the first one on the album, and so it gets played the most.</p>
<p><em>I Get A Kick Out Of You</em>, <a href="http://www.jamiecullum.com">Jamie Cullum</a> The young Brit sensation covers an old Cole Porter song. A fun big-band-type arrangement with some good piano work thrown in. I have a huge appreciation for guys like Jamie who have gone back and revived the old big band and jazz.</p>
<p><strong>Top five albums?</strong></p>
<p>Oh gosh, this is a tough one.</p>
<p><em>Long Line of Leavers</em>, Caedmon&rsquo;s Call This was my first taste of Caedmon&rsquo;s, and still, I think, my favorite overall album. If only they could have left off <em>Valleys Fill First</em>&hellip;</p>
<p><em>The House Show</em>, Derek Webb OK, this is a cop-out - it&rsquo;s not either of his actual studio albums, but it&rsquo;s live, which kicks it up a notch in my book, it has the best of <em>She Must and Shall Go Free</em>, and it includes Derek&rsquo;s cover of Bob Dylan&rsquo;s <em>Every Grain of Sand</em>, which is one of my favorites (of Derek&rsquo;s, not of Dylan&rsquo;s).</p>
<p><em>Ghosts</em>, Sleeping at Last This one has grown on me a ton since I first listened to it. It&rsquo;s the direction that I like rock music to go, and I reserve it for either times when I need to tune out at work (which must be often, seeing how many times I&rsquo;ve played the album) or while I&rsquo;m driving with the windows down in the car.</p>
<p><em>When Harry Met Sally Soundtrack</em>, Harry Connick, Jr. Here&rsquo;s my nod to the jazz and big band that I love so much. To think that Harry was early 20&rsquo;s and recording this album just blows me away. I fell in love with the mellow saxophone solo on <em>Love is Here to Stay</em> way back in high school and it&rsquo;s still one of my favorite songs. And the piano solo version of <em>Winter Wonderland</em> just makes me shake my head in wonder. Good stuff.</p>
<p><em>Photographs</em>, Andrew Osenga I always skip <em>Kankakee</em> and start the album off with <em>Kara</em>. From there on, it&rsquo;s solid all the way through <em>New Mexico</em> at the end.</p>
<p><em>A Rush of Blood to the Head</em>, Coldplay OK, so I&rsquo;m listing six albums. I couldn&rsquo;t decide between Andy O and Coldplay, so you get both. This one gets a lot of playtime, too.</p>
<p><strong>Last album bought?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to remember. I think it was Eric Clapton&rsquo;s <em>Unplugged</em>, which is a very fine album. I just had somebody give me a copy of Andrew Peterson&rsquo;s <em>Behold the Lamb of God</em>, and it&rsquo;s top-notch as well.</p>
<p><strong>Recent discoveries?</strong></p>
<p>Jamie Cullum, Andy Osenga, and Sleeping at Last all appeared on my radar about 2 years ago. Sandra McCracken was a nice discovery earlier this year. (Don&rsquo;t know why I neglected to buy her stuff for so long&hellip;)</p>
<p><strong>Passing on the musical baton.</strong> Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/sillyjoe/">Silly Joe</a> <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=amburgler7">Amber</a> <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/richard">Richard</a> <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/danielle/">Danielle</a> <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/chris/">Chris from L.C.</a></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Gary Haugen spoke to us last Tuesday afternoon at the pastor&rsquo;s conference at Moody. Gary is the president of the <a href="http://www.ijm.org">International Justice Mission</a>, a Christian organization dedicated to providing &ldquo;investigation strategies, legal expertise, and cutting-edge technology to rescue individual victims of injustice and abuse around the world.&rdquo; His topic: God&rsquo;s priority for justice, and how his organization is working in that area.</p>
<p>A little background on Gary first; the guy is a pit bull. He&rsquo;s rather a small man, but his physique and flat-top haircut would lead you to believe he&rsquo;s done a stint in the Marines. (That&rsquo;s purely conjecture on my part, but you get the image.) He grew up in a Christian family, graduated from Harvard Law, went to work for the Department of Justice, and was the head of the UN task force that went to Rwanda to investigate the genocide back in the 90&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;s obviously seen a lot in his time.</p>
<p>Gary described his work in Rwanda briefly; harder than sifting through the dead bodies, he said, was having to interview the ones who survived. He then told us about people who have been subjects of persecution and injustice in various places: an african man who was randomly shot by the police and then jailed so he couldn&rsquo;t talk about it; a 9-year-old girl sold into slavery, forced to roll cigarettes 12 hours a day; young girls sold into prostitution rings; our stomachs were turning after just the first description or two. I think we often choose to forget or ignore these brutalities, here in the USA. And in a sense, I can understand it. (More on that later.)</p>
<p>Gary then walked us through several scriptures that point out God&rsquo;s concern for justice, for protecting the innocent and &ldquo;defending the orphan and the widow&rdquo;. Key among his texts was Micah 6:8: &ldquo;He has shown you, o man, what is good, and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo; Justice is mentioned first. So why do we ignore it so often? I need to examine this in my own life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had sort of a built-in repulsion to &ldquo;bleeding heart&rdquo; presentations or pleas. Partly, I suppose, this is due to my engineering nature; I want the bare facts, not all the emotional things that can cloud the issue. But I think there&rsquo;s another side to it; it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t care about the people; it&rsquo;s more that I feel overwhelmed. What can I do? And so, if I can&rsquo;t do anything, I&rsquo;d much rather forget about it than be nagged by the reminders of a hopeless problem.</p>
<p>What Gary did on Tuesday was remind us that it <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> hopeless. There are people who are doing good work. His mission is one. I may have to think about supporting it in the future. And prayer is our number one tool. Too often I forget to pray; I just get caught up in the helplessness of it all. Thanks to God for being the Helper of the helpless. There are no helpless situations with Him.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s Thursday afternoon and the conference is winding down. There&rsquo;s only one general session left, and while there is anticipation to hear the speaker (Tony Evans), there is still the sadness, weariness, and relief that accompanies the end of a conference. How to describe it? It might be akin to the feeling at the end of a week at bible camp, at the end of a retreat, or even at the end of a college school year. Sadness because these past few days of enjoyment, learning, and fellowship with brothers will soon be over. Weariness because none of us have gotten enough sleep over the past few days. At 6:30 AM on Tuesday, the dining hall was full of breakfasters. By this morning, it was only half full at 7:00. Relief because I know within the next 12 hours I will be back at home, sleeping in my bed, with my wife at my side, and my daughter in the crib in the next room. Relief in getting back to a routine that is more &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, even if it means that I will again become the feeder instead of the one being fed. I think similar feelings accompany all endings; we look back with fondness and lingering regret even as we look forward, knowing that we won&rsquo;t really be happy if things stay the same; life is made up not of stasis but of change. Memory provides the anchors that give us a mental, emotional, and spiritual stasis even in the midst of life&rsquo;s perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Even for Thursday afternoon, the student center is still noisy with activity. Only the tenor of the noise has changed, from the buzz of Monday&rsquo;s anticipation and the rumble of Tuesday&rsquo;s discussion and rumination, to Thursday&rsquo;s dull roar of completion and the rattle of luggage wheels crossing the tile floor on their way to the cars in the parking garage across the street. Still the people are here. Students reading. That software vendor finishing up a late lunch before taking down his display and heading home. Two young mothers sharing a table with three three small children and a double stroller. There are two men in a booth behind me who have been criticizing the worship band that&rsquo;s been playing at sessions this week. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even hear yourself sing when they play.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re singing off or on.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only really good when you&rsquo;re singing with the pipe organ.&rdquo; It appears that some things never change.</p>
<p>There have been so many good teaching moments over the past several days, and so many ideas for writing, that I&rsquo;m going to have to just write some short drafts of them right now, and then flesh them out as I have time over the next few weeks. It&rsquo;s hard even to know where to start. We have heard from a huge cross-section of evangelical teaching. Ravi Zacharias, the Indian philosopher and logician. D. A. Carson, the intellectual professor par excellence. Gary Haugen, one-time leader of the United Nations team that investigated the Rwandan genocide. James MacDonald, the pastor of Harvest Church here in Chicago who at first glance would have you think that Tony Soprano, or better yet, Michael Chiklis&rsquo;s character from The Shield had taken to preaching. Direct. Hard-nosed. Bang-on. Colin Smith, his Scottish brogue beginning to be tempered by 15 years in the States. Sam Solomon (I suspect somehow this was a pseudonym), an Afghani who warned us of the evils of the system of Islam. Joe Stowell, the long-time president of Moody, passing the torch to his recent successor. Each of these deserves an essay in their own right, and then separate essays for the things I learned from them.</p>
<p>I hope that, months from now, I can point back to this week as a defining point in my life this year. That sounds very dramatic, and I don&rsquo;t mean it to be. But this conference has challenged me to a renewed passion for Christ, a renewed desire to lead in my family, a renewed desire to make a priority of the Word and prayer. I have been too dry for too long; when Erwin Lutzer warned this morning of the pitfall of losing clear focus, and neglecting the disciplines, I felt at the same time the prick of conviction that I have done so, and some small (though I keep thinking misplaced) comfort that I am not alone in that struggle. I get so caught up in the things of ministry that the time in prayer and the Word get neglected. I think of it this way: how many hours have I spent in the last month working on church stuff? I&rsquo;ve worked on two websites, set up a blog, installed a new projector, led worship for an outdoor Sunday service, led a worship team practice or two, and that&rsquo;s just what I can think of from the top of my head. I have spent hours and hours on good stuff like that. But how many hours have I spent in the Word and prayer? Honestly? An hour? Two? Certainly not more. I say this to my shame, and in the sadness that an active, busy life of ministry can be the mask for an inner man that too often is missing meals and not getting rest. I need to change some priorities. God help me as I try to get things balanced better.</p>
<p>This post is meandering more than the well-formed post would; I wander from observation to insight to self-examination and back again. Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t lose you halfway through it; I guess I should remember that if you&rsquo;ve gotten this far, you&rsquo;ve read it. If you&rsquo;re my friend and you read this, get back to me in a couple weeks and see how I&rsquo;m doing. My only trouble with being consistent is being so on a regular basis.</p>

			 <p><em><a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=amburgler7">Amber</a> liked my attempt at a descriptive writing post yesterday so I thought I&rsquo;d give it another go. Just more observations from the Moody conference.</em></p>
<p>The stupid wifi still doesn&rsquo;t work. All I want to do is just sit here and write directly to my blog, but it doesn&rsquo;t work. Arrgh. I&rsquo;m back in the student center at <a href="http://www.moody.edu">Moody</a>, at another one of those square tables that host mid-day meals, conversations between old friends, and students with backpacks full of homework. At the table behind me is an Army chaplain with oak leaves on his lapels, that makes him what, a captain? It warms my heart to know that he&rsquo;s taking the time to minister to our servicemen.</p>
<p>Across the room to my left is the Moody sales table. Either they stocked up on Conference polo shirts this year, or grey isn&rsquo;t a popular color - Richard assured me the shirts are usually sold out by Monday afternoon; it&rsquo;s Tuesday afternoon and they still have quite a pile left. Maybe their color choices aren&rsquo;t always the greatest; they have t-shirts for sale left over from last year that are a not-quite-so-nice shade of brown&hellip; but they&rsquo;re only $3 so I might just pick one up anyway. You can also buy coffee mugs, baseball caps, and some various books and literature. Sadly, for their sales prospects, I don&rsquo;t drink coffee and it&rsquo;ll take something more special than a pastor&rsquo;s conference to supplant the Cubs on my baseball cap brim. Maybe the t-shirt is the right call.</p>
<p>Display booths on my right advertise products attractive to those in ministry: graduate school, online bible courses, bible study software, a publishing house. The representatives at these sales booths are worth a closer study. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d find it a fun assignment to have to man a booth like that. There are two across the room from me. Both are men in their late thirties or early forties; both are somewhat overweight and dressed in their best professional oxford shirts and sweater vests. Both are browsing on their laptops, eating lunch. Maybe I should see if either of them have gotten wifi to work&hellip; When a customer approaches, you can see them go into this &ldquo;Christian sales&rdquo; mode. It&rsquo;s somewhat weird to me, because I typically think of salesmen as pushy, annoying, caring little about you and what you want, and more about how they can manipulate you into buying their product. But with these guys, they&rsquo;re restrained, trying to be helpful, obviously in sales mode with their product, but at the same time remaining mindful that the men they&rsquo;re selling to are their brothers in Christ who need enhanced ministries, not just a cool (expensive) software program. I wish there were more salesmen like them. I&rsquo;d love to buy a car from a guy who had my best interests in mind rather than his own&hellip; but that&rsquo;s a totally different subject. :-)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quieting down now that the next general session has started. There&rsquo;s a round table with five guys around it and the remnants of their lunch still on it; apparently they&rsquo;re skipping the session to continue the discussion - a good idea if you ask me. There are several guys sitting around singly, like me, taking time to read, write, think. There are still some t-shirts for sale&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll go buy one. At $3, they&rsquo;re a steal, even if they are brown.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s 1:10 PM and I&rsquo;m skipping a general session to sit and write. Richard described this conference as &ldquo;trying to get a drink of water from a firehose&rdquo;, and he&rsquo;s not much wrong. So far today we&rsquo;ve had general sessions with D.A. Carson and Gene Getz, and I went to a workshop also with Dr. Getz. And that was all before lunch! This afternoon there&rsquo;s another general session and then a workshop before dinner. As I already said, I&rsquo;m skipping the general session to do some writing, mostly because if I don&rsquo;t take the time to write things down, I&rsquo;ll start forgetting&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t want to forget. It&rsquo;ll be much more valuable for me to cement some things in my mind rather than just go soak up some more things that I won&rsquo;t have time to remember.</p>
<p>Last night was <a href="http://www.rzim.org/">Ravi Zacharias</a>. He is brilliant. In the areas of metaphysics and logic, few are his equal. His topic was &ldquo;Questionable Questions: Four questions skeptics ask that point to Christ&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll write a separate post just on his message. Very impressive. Had a snack, decided to skip out on the late movie (<em>National Treasure</em>) since I&rsquo;d just seen it last weekend, and went to bed.</p>
<p>One other thing I don&rsquo;t want to forget from last night: we had a pianist providing special music. His name is <a href="http://www.anthonyburger.com/">Anthony Burger</a>, and he usually plays with the Gaithers. His style is very showy, which means I don&rsquo;t like it much. He plays with an instrumental track, it makes me think that <a href="http://www.liberace.com/">Liberace</a> got saved and started playing Christian music. But the last song of his set was Handel&rsquo;s glorious <em>Hallelujah Chorus</em>. The power of that music drove away my discontent with the style of the presentation. Within the first few measures of the song, all 2000+ men in the auditorium stood to honor God in that great tradition of the <em>Chorus</em>. All the guys that knew parts were singing along. Words to not do it justice. Being in a room with 2000 men who want to worship God and having such a majestic chorus to do it with? Amazing. Fantastic. Superb. I&rsquo;ll shut up now. :-)</p>
<p>This morning we had our first general session with Dr. D. A. Carson. He is probably the most &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; speaker of the week. He apologized at one point early in the presentation for ending a sentence with a preposition! Just that kind of guy. He is a research professor at <a href="http://www.tiu.edu/">Trinity Evangelical School of Divinity</a>, which means they basically retain him just to do research and write books. That being said, he&rsquo;s a very good speaker as well. His ten-dollar words and presentation had John&rsquo;s eyes permanently glazed over, but Richard and I loved it. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to hearing Dr. Carson again tomorrow.</p>
<p>As Dr. Carson&rsquo;s session dismissed, I headed off at a trot to get to the workshop with Dr. Gene Getz on Elders and Leadership in the church. It was a very good session&hellip; he reminded us that we need to stop assuming that the &ldquo;form&rdquo; that we&rsquo;ve practiced with in our culture for all these years can substitute for the &ldquo;supracultural&rdquo; principles of leadership. There are the principles, which are universal. They transcend culture. Then there are the practices. They have to be customized depending on the culture and circumstance the church is in. I will have to take some time to digest it some more, but I think we can gain some things that we can implement at Noelridge. Dr. Getz then had the second morning session, where he taught on the importance of godly leadership in the church. Nothing super profound, but still encouraging and challenging.</p>
<p>The music times here have been pretty decent so far. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the band is quite good. I always have a little trouble not being critical with bands, I guess they stick out to me more because I&rsquo;m the musician. They&rsquo;ve had a good balance of both old and new music; at the second morning session we sang Matt Redmond&rsquo;s <em>Blessed Be Your Name</em> and followed it up with <em>It Is Well With My Soul</em>. Nice. I wish the worship leader were a little less showy and a little more of a musician, but I get the feeling that it&rsquo;s just style, not heart attitude, so I can look past it.</p>
<p>Richard and I are going to be slackers tonight; we&rsquo;re going to a <a href="http://cubs.mlb.com">Cubs</a> game. The Astros are in town and Roger Clemens is pitching. Now, that probably means that the Cubbies will lose, but then, what else is new? It will be a little chilly tonight, but should be a great time. I love Wrigley Field. It will be a good break from the fire hose.</p>

			 <p>Monday, May 23rd 3:30 PM</p>
<p>Richard picked me up at the house at 8:20 or so this morning. Said goodbye to Becky, Laura, and Becky&rsquo;s parents and headed out to Chicago. We picked up Sam and John on the way and then traversed I-88 in a purple Chevy Blazer to get to Chicago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first time at <a href="http://www.moody.edu">Moody</a> and it&rsquo;s an interesting campus. Land is obviously at a premium in downtown Chicago, so the campus feels a bit cramped. I&rsquo;m sitting in the student center writing this, where I can view the registration area and various folks milling around, waiting for dinner and the start of the conference&rsquo;s activites tonight. If only they had wi-fi access&hellip; I asked before I came and they said there was wi-fi in here, but I guess they were wrong. Or maybe they have it turned off&hellip; who knows? So, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to resort to dial-up back in my room.</p>
<p>You can see the whole cross-section of evangelical church leadership just here in the student center. At the table next to me is a guy in jeans, a t-shirt, and a <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin</a> baseball cap. He looks typically midwestern. Across the room is a group of several black guys dressed to the nines - suits, ties, very slick. One of them is probably 5-9, 325, wearing a lime green pinstriped suit with the lapels turned up. Stylin', I guess. Basic attire seems to be jeans and t-shirts, which is nicely relaxed for a pastor&rsquo;s conference. I had a fleeting image of guys whose idea of &ldquo;casual&rdquo; dress was an open collar and loafers with their slacks and jacket&hellip; I am happy in that regard to have been (at least for now) proved wrong. Here next to me a few minutes ago was one Institute staff member talking with a few friends from out of town. They were discussing the latest Star Wars movie, so I tried to ignore them since I haven&rsquo;t seen it, and won&rsquo;t see it until our break on Wednesday. If I wasn&rsquo;t going to the movie Wednesday, and if I&rsquo;d brought my basketball shoes along, they&rsquo;re having an organized 3-on-3 basketball tournament on Wednesday afternoon&hellip; that could be fun. Oh well, maybe next time I come.</p>
<p>We had a late lunch this afternoon at a goofy diner called <a href="http://featuredfoods.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.exe/a-store/c-Ed_DebevicAns.shtml?E+scstore+debevic">Ed Debevic&rsquo;s</a>. The highlight of this place is the waitstaff that is intentionally rude to the diners. Our waitress was sullen, cynical, and had us nicknamed. Grey-haired Sam was &ldquo;Pops&rdquo;. John, the youth pastor was &ldquo;Sparky&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure she had a nickname for me - I guess I was beyond description. Our waitress was actually pretty tame compared to the other guy who was serving. There was a booth with two younger-ish women across and down from us a bit. At one point, they must have complained or something about their rootbeer float. So, the waiter grabs it off the table, carries it three booths away, sets it down, and yells at the top of his lungs, &ldquo;Well how&rsquo;s this, will you enjoy your rootbeer float better when it&rsquo;s over here?&rdquo; They weren&rsquo;t quite sure how to respond. Once the waiter had left, a guy from a neighboring booth went over and returned the float to them - they were a bit too cowed to retrieve it themselves. Later, they made the mistake of asking for extra napkins. He walked away, shaking his head. Then, in a loud voice from behind the counter, he was laughing at top volume, and holding his head in his hands. &ldquo;More napkins?!? For the love! More napkins?&rdquo; Then they got their napkins.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s almost 4:00 now and the stream of men coming into the student center has continued uninterrupted. Across the way, Gene Getz, who is one of our general session speakers, is greeting some friends and mingling with the crowd. The Wisconsin fan is still sitting there, hasn&rsquo;t moved or spoken since I sat down. Two guys behind me are discussing the future of Moody Broadcasting. Just another day in the big city. Dinner is in two shifts, and ours starts in half an hour. Like I need it after the cheese burger from Ed&rsquo;s.</p>

			 <p>Wow, the day is getting long and it&rsquo;s not even 1030 yet. I&rsquo;m in a wrap-up mode at work; I&rsquo;m taking vacation next week, and when I get back I&rsquo;m transitioning to a new project, so I don&rsquo;t really want to start on anything new. I had some prototype stuff to work on, but whenever I try to code-generate for it, the program blows up. (The code generator, not my program&hellip;) So, that&rsquo;s going nowhere fast. I am sooooo not motivated to get stuff done. If I wasn&rsquo;t burning a week of vacation next week, I&rsquo;d take this afternoon off. But I can&rsquo;t just keep burning vacation willy-nilly or I won&rsquo;t have any left&hellip;</p>
<p>After work this afternoon I&rsquo;m going to install the projector that you&rsquo;ve heard so much about over the past weeks. Hopefully the long-throw lens will come today so I can actually test the whole thing out. But even if it doesn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll at least get the wiring and mounting done, and adding the lens will be trivial. I can&rsquo;t wait to get it working&hellip;</p>
<p>Seeing as this is a very random post I&rsquo;ll also note here that on our afternoon off from the pastor&rsquo;s conference next week I have tickets to go see Star Wars Ep 3 on a digital projection screen. The picture quality for digital projection is supposed to be <em>awesome</em>&hellip; the two guys I&rsquo;m going with saw Ep 2 there a few years ago and are still raving about it. I had thought about going to Wrigley and trying to pick up a ticket to see the Cubs, but I probably can&rsquo;t afford that&hellip; so I&rsquo;ll stick with Star Wars.</p>
<p>Well I guess I&rsquo;ll have to find some more quasi-work to justify my time here until I can leave at 1500. Who knows, I may even post here again.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday afternoon my manager walked in and asked me if I&rsquo;d like to become a software lead for an upcoming project. It&rsquo;s a move up, of sorts, though probably without a pay increase.</p>
<p>For the past 6 years, I&rsquo;ve been just a software engineer, which means that I just get assignments to do software changes, and I do them. It&rsquo;s been a fine job, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot. As software lead, I would basically be responsible for making sure <em>all</em> of the software changes get done for the project, making sure they are done correctly, solving any of the difficult technical problems, setting up the development environment, creating the releaseable software&hellip; wait, I guess that&rsquo;s stuff I&rsquo;ve been doing at least a bit of in my current position. I guess my last few years have served me well. :-)</p>
<p>The one thing I am not looking forward to is moving from a Windows-based development environment to a VAX-based environment. Not that I&rsquo;m scared of moving away from GUI to command-line - heck, I prefer command-line; but I hate having to learn a whole new tool set. Oh well, it&rsquo;s the one development environment I haven&rsquo;t worked with yet in 6 years, so it will broaden my knowledge. Or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little scary moving up to this position, but not too bad. I had originally been told that I was going to be the project engineer, which would entail a lot more document-writing and paperwork. That was much scarier. This will just be a good move up the chain. I think I&rsquo;m starting to look forward to it&hellip;</p>

			 <p>This weekend was my sister Rebecca&rsquo;s high school graduation. She&rsquo;s the youngest of us 5 kids, and the only girl, which means she&rsquo;s spoiled just a little. :-) She graduated in a class of 8 students from her christian school, and I&rsquo;d be a liar if I said I wasn&rsquo;t quite proud of her. Anyway, here&rsquo;s Rebecca the graduate.</p>
<p><img src="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1789.jpg" alt="Rebecca the graduate"></p>
<p>Rebecca is normally quite a goofball and lots of fun; here she&rsquo;s showing her more ornery side&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1793.jpg" alt="Rebecca with her tongue out"></p>
<p>Andrew (our brother) is only 16 months older than Rebecca and they have always been best buddies. And they&rsquo;re so cute! :-) (Andrew&rsquo;s gonna bring the smackdown on me for that comment&hellip;)</p>
<p><img src="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1794.jpg" alt="Rebecca and Andrew"></p>
<p>This next one is all of us Hubbs kids except for Aaron, who is in Panama working with YWAM there. Sure wish he could&rsquo;ve made it back! We do miss him. <em>(l-r is Ryan, Rebecca, me, and Andrew)</em></p>
<p><img src="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1799.jpg" alt="The Hubbs kids&hellip; only missing Aaron."></p>
<p>This last one is from the party on Sunday - we had over 100 people at our house for a big party. At one point, we had volleyball, football, and soccer games all going on at the same point. It was a blast. Actually, there&rsquo;s no games being played in this picture, but Rebecca is having fun with her niece (my daughter) Laura. That&rsquo;s Rebecca&rsquo;s friend April trying to duck out of the picture there in the background.</p>
<p><img src="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/wp-content/uploads/IMG_1810.jpg" alt="Rebecca and Laura"></p>
<p>The one person I didn&rsquo;t manage to get a picture of was Andrew&rsquo;s girlfriend Amber. I did get to meet her, and I should say some nice things about her since she&rsquo;ll probably be reading this post eventually. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve met her, but she seems really nice, and for a girl who&rsquo;s all of about 5'1&quot;, she plays a mean game of volleyball. I only spiked on her a couple times. :-)</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s enough photos for now&hellip; hope you enjoyed them. It was a wonderful weekend.</p>

			 <p>Well, the <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/cakeboy/2005/05/04/making-music-family-style/">long-awaited Sunday</a> finally got here and I got to play keyboards in the worship team at my family&rsquo;s church with my brother <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hubbs86">Andrew</a> leading. It was <em>awesome.</em> It was his first time leading a worship band but he did a very good job. The set list was something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blessed Be Your Name</li>
<li>Be Glorified In Me</li>
<li>Unfailing Love <em>(a new Chris Tomlin song&hellip; very good, very singable)</em></li>
<li>Draw Me Close</li>
<li>Knowing You</li>
<li>I Will Praise Him Still</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhere in there Andrew and Ryan (another of my brothers) and I did a special number, the old Steve Camp song <em>Love That Will Not Let Me Go</em>. It was fantastic.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed getting to play keys and sing backup on the team; I&rsquo;ve been leading my own team for so long, it was fun to play second-fiddle. It was also really neat to see my brother pursue a dream of his, to lead the team. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be doing it again&hellip; and maybe one of these days I&rsquo;ll get him to come down here and play on my team. :-)</p>

			 <p>No, this isn&rsquo;t a home-improvement post&hellip; It&rsquo;s more of a dealing-with-being-a-man-and-an-engineer post. :-)</p>
<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve had to learn over the past almost 7 years of marriage is to resist my instinctual impulse to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; everything. It&rsquo;s different than at work. At work, my job is being presented with problems and designing solutions. At home, it&rsquo;s not so much that way. When my wife comes to me with a problem, most of the time she doesn&rsquo;t want me to design an elegant solution to her problem&hellip; most of the time she just wants me to shut up and listen, sympathize with her pain/frustration/whatever, and give her a hug. Once the emotional part is over then she&rsquo;s enough of an engineer, too, that we can both work out a good solution to the problem. Still, it&rsquo;s dang hard to shut my mouth sometimes.</p>
<p>Another one lately that has prompted this internal &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to fix it&rdquo; reminder has been observing a recent brouhaha played out at least a bit over the blogs and comments of <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=thinkinofyou_87">my sister</a>, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hubbs86">my brother</a>, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=amburgler7">his girlfriend</a>, and some other assorted players. The big brother and engineer part of me wants to dive right in, take sides, give lots of advice, try to fix everything up so that they&rsquo;re happy again. But then I think back to my high-school years&hellip; I had undue amounts of girl-anguish, people that I really disliked, frustrations with life, and the like. But nobody needed to come fix them for me&hellip; I needed to live through them, learn from them. God used them to work in my life.</p>
<p>I was reading in Lamentations this morning (kinda painful to read, to be honest) and I was struck by how the prophet says God allowed all this pain and anguish of His people so that they would learn a lesson and repent. Read it again sometime. It&rsquo;s a short book, but there&rsquo;s a lot of painful descriptions there. Life would not have been fun for the Israelites who lived through the fulfillment of that prophecy. But then in the same little book, we get the reminder - God&rsquo;s mercies are new every morning, great is His faithfulness.</p>
<p>So Andrew, Rebecca, Amber, if you&rsquo;re reading this - I&rsquo;ll give my two cents' worth of advice right here, and be done with it. :-) Love God and pursue Him above all else. As far as it depends on you, be at peace with <strong>all</strong> men. Live life one day at a time, and remember that today is only one day of maybe 30,000 in your whole life. There&rsquo;s plenty left to be lived.</p>

			 <p>At least for Sunday, that is&hellip; I was unable to wrangle up a musician for the Sunday service, so my next option is to record my piano-playing on the electronic keyboard, so they can just play it back on Sunday. How lame is that? (I am humongously opposed to using recorded music in a church service, pretty much just because it can cause so much trouble for anyone who loses their place, it seems artificial, etc. Live accompaniment is always better.) Anyhow, it&rsquo;s a nice Roland keyboard with a disk drive built in, so I&rsquo;ll be recording the tracks and then they can play them back live&hellip; it&rsquo;s at least better than recording on audio tape and playing it back. :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll end up uncoordinated and kind of lame on Sunday, but unfortunately I can&rsquo;t really help that. We need more musicians!</p>

			 <p>&hellip;any musician. One of the downsides of being the music leader at a small church is that it&rsquo;s hard to find a replacement when you&rsquo;re going to be gone. I have a couple people who are on the usual list to back me up&hellip; one guitarist and one pianist. Usually at least one of them will be available. Well, I&rsquo;m out of town this weekend for my sister&rsquo;s graduation. The guitarist is also out of town this weekend. The pianist is watching 4 of her grandkids all weekend and doesn&rsquo;t have the time she needs to practice. Our bass player who might be able to fill in on guitar in a pinch is also out of town. I&rsquo;m not quite sure what I&rsquo;m going to do&hellip; they may be singing <em>a capella</em> on Sunday.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other possibility that someone mentioned - a recent attender who is rumored to be a piano teacher. However, I&rsquo;ve never talked to her about playing for a service, and I&rsquo;m not sure of her skill level, (or even if she&rsquo;s actually a piano teacher). So, I&rsquo;m fairly uncomfortable making a phone call that will go something like this: &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Chris from Noelridge, remember me? I know you haven&rsquo;t been to church in a couple weeks, but I heard a rumor you might be a piano teacher and so I&rsquo;m wondering if you&rsquo;d like to play the piano for church this week and by the way practice is tomorrow night&hellip;&rdquo; Not a real good option in my book. Well, it&rsquo;ll work out somehow. I <em>will</em> get out of town this weekend.</p>

			 <p>Well that personality thing was kinda boring, wasn&rsquo;t it? You, reader, deserve a real, human-written post, and I am now here to give it to you.</p>
<p>My day was brightened this morning when I realized that, after this week, I will only have 5 more days of work for the month of May. Vacation is a glorious thing. :-) This weekend I&rsquo;m taking one day off to go to Wisconsin for <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=thinkinofyou_87">my sister&rsquo;s</a> high school graduation. I&rsquo;ll come back on Monday and work Tuesday through Friday (May 17-20) and then I&rsquo;m taking the next week off. Four of us from church are going to the <a href="http://moodyconferences.com/default.asp?SectionID=31787594364B44308B8C7502D07DADF9">Moody Pastor&rsquo;s Conference</a> in Chicago. (No, it&rsquo;s not for moody pastors - it&rsquo;s for pastors, and it&rsquo;s at Moody. :-))</p>
<p>Now, my readers of a Reformed theological persuasion might be wincing at this mention of a non-Reformed institute and conference, but I am much looking forward to it; the conference opens with a message from <a href="http://www.rzim.org">Ravi Zacharias</a>, and is bookended with a closing message from <a href="http://www.tonyevans.org">Tony Evans</a>. I am sure that the middle presentations will be excellent as well. So, that runs Monday evening through Thursday evening. Then it&rsquo;s back home for Memorial Day weekend. Whew!</p>
<p>Sometime in there, I&rsquo;ll try to get the new projector installed, too&hellip; I&rsquo;m ordering it today.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s the fun news and calendar update from Chris' s life. I hope you enjoyed it. :-)</p>

			 <p>OK, I&rsquo;m excited. I just finished talking to my brother <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hubbs86">Andrew</a>. He is almost 19, has been playing on the worship team at his church (Richland Center Fellowship, Richland Center, Wisconsin) for a while now, and has the opportunity to lead the worship service in a couple weeks&hellip; on the Sunday that the rest of the family is going to be visiting!</p>
<p>We have a musical family. Dad was a music education major, Mom minored in voice, and all of us 5 kids play at least 1 instrument, some of us several. We did occasional special music and such growing up, and I really miss the chances to do stuff with them. We know so much of the same music that it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Quick picture to paint: we&rsquo;re all home at Christmastime, and I&rsquo;m sitting in the living room just goofing around on my guitar with <a href="http://caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call&rsquo;s</a> <em><a href="http://caedmonscall.net/songs/bh/track04.php">Hands of the Potter</a></em>. My brother Aaron (age 21) is working on installing a cat door in the porch door, I didn&rsquo;t even think he&rsquo;s paying attention, and as I get to the chorus, he just kicks in singing the backup part. It was way too cool.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Aaron is off in Panama doing missions, but Ryan (age 25) and Andrew and I will all be around on that Sunday, and the plan is that we will all help out with the worship time, playing and singing. This is exciting for multiple reasons; first, to get to play music with those guys again is a treat. Second, I&rsquo;m the worship leader of a church of 150 or so rather subdued worshippers (God&rsquo;s &ldquo;frozen chosen&rdquo; :-)). We&rsquo;ll be leading at a church of 400 or so more energetic types. Thirdly (and maybe this should be first, priority-wise), I get to help encourage Andrew in his quest to head down a similar path as I&rsquo;ve gone down, to use his musical talents as a worship leader. That will be the best part, for sure.</p>
<p>I suppose I should get back to work now, but excitement like this needs someplace to be poured out, even if it is just to a window in WordPress. :-)</p>

			 <p>Another day, another NRO column to comment on. Today it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/taylor_200505040803.asp">Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren arguing on the &ldquo;myths&rdquo; of energy independence</a>. They have some interesting views on the subject, noting that:</p>
<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s a global marketplace, so the amount of oil we import vs the amount of oil we produce doesn&rsquo;t affect the price - only the global quantity on the market affects the price</li>
</ol>
<p>and,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>it wouldn&rsquo;t be wise to totally cut ourselves off from the foriegn oil market, because a limited domestic production is easier for terrorists to strike than a distributed (global) production.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, they&rsquo;re good libertarians from the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a>, so their answer is to quit subsidizing the fuel situation, and just let the free market play itself out. I&rsquo;m not so sure I agree with this; part of me would like to see a &ldquo;Manhattan Project&rdquo;-style effort to develop a usable alternative fuel system. But their comments about the global oil market make the article worth a read.</p>

			 <p>Our first softball game of the season is tonight. I&rsquo;m soooo much looking forward to it. It&rsquo;ll be nasty conditions for playing - probably 50 degrees and a 20 mph wind. But that&rsquo;s not the point - it&rsquo;s just great to be out playing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have the additional fun of getting to umpire the early game - in our league it&rsquo;s recreational enough that we don&rsquo;t have paid umps, instead each team that plays the early game supplies somebody to ump for the late game, and <em>vice versa</em>. I enjoy the umping at least as much as the playing&hellip;. weird.</p>
<p>Hopefully Laura doesn&rsquo;t freeze tonight out with us; if she&rsquo;s getting cold, it&rsquo;ll be up to me to keep track of her so Becky can keep playing. The joys of spring softball in Iowa - we had flurries here this morning! :-)</p>

			 <p>OK, so it&rsquo;s Friday afternoon, and I&rsquo;m bored. I&rsquo;ve hit the end of the task list for work today, and nobody else has updated their blogs to give me something to read&hellip; so I post this whiny entry with the knowledge that in 30 minutes my weekend will begin. I guess I&rsquo;ll make it. :-)</p>
<p>Tonight we&rsquo;re going to our favorite coffeehouse, <a href="http://www.brewedawakeningscr.com"><em>Brewed Awakenings</em></a> to hear a friend perform. He&rsquo;s a heck of a singer, doesn&rsquo;t do any originals, but covers everybody from Dylan and the Beatles to John Denver to James Taylor to Crash Test Dummies&hellip; good times.</p>
<p>Then Saturday will be a work day at home, maybe I&rsquo;ll get done <a href="/05/04/projects/">last weekend&rsquo;s projects</a>&hellip; then Sunday is typical church stuff, and the Monday starts the softball season! I&rsquo;ve been <a href="/05/04/softball/">looking forward to it</a> for weeks. Sounds like it&rsquo;ll be chilly for the first game (in the 50&rsquo;s) but that just makes it more fun.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s all for now&hellip; have a great weekend!</p>

<p>He argues that by accusing the &ldquo;Christian Right&rdquo; of being hateful and &ldquo;at war with America&rdquo;, <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> (as just one participant in a trend by the media) is themselves promoting &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; of a group&hellip; the Christian Right. He writes:</p>

<p>According to <em>Harper’s</em>, conservative Christians are making “war on America.” Can you imagine the reaction to a cover story about a “war on America” by blacks, gays, Hispanics, or Jews?</p>

			 <p>I know I owe everybody a blog post (it&rsquo;s been a couple days&hellip; time to keep writing) but it&rsquo;s been pretty slow around here lately. My latest task at work has been to manually compare two 200-ish-page documents and mark all the changes. (At this point, the geeks reading this are asking &ldquo;why manually diff it when you could use a tool?&rdquo; The answer is, I&rsquo;m looking for functional differences, not trivial wording differences. Ugh.) I finally finished that up this morning but my eyes are a little bleary now and I know more about this next new airplane than I really wanted to.</p>
<p>I did some fun website stuff last night for my <a href="http://recminusa.org">RecMinUsa</a> site&hellip; my pastor (who runs RecMinUsa) wants to be able to update the &ldquo;upcoming events&rdquo; page without having to look at HTML. So, I created a formatted text file that he can update, and then a perl script to post-process the text file and merge it with an HTML template to create the page. It seems to work OK&hellip; hopefully I kept it simple enough. :-)</p>
<p>I read some more of Peterson&rsquo;s <em>Christ Plays in Ten Thousand Places</em> last night. I&rsquo;m to the point in the book where he&rsquo;s talking about how Christ &ldquo;plays&rdquo; in community. I&rsquo;m still organizing my thoughts on the topic, but it&rsquo;s good stuff. I&rsquo;ll have to devote a post to it when I get the time to think.</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s the 8:45 news from Iowa&hellip; kind of boring, huh? Sorry. Come back again, it&rsquo;ll be more interesting next time. I promise.</p>

			 <p>Ned Rice has a <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/rice200504250753.asp">great column</a> today on NRO where he makes a strong argument that the folks whining about the lack of liberalism in the new pope should suck it up, think about what they&rsquo;re saying, take their beliefs (and the church&rsquo;s beliefs) seriously, and then pack it up and leave if they&rsquo;re really that unhappy. The column deals specifically with the Roman Catholic church, but I think the ideas are applicable to any person complaining about their church&rsquo;s beliefs.</p>
<p>The whole column is worth reading, but I&rsquo;ll copy a few of the choice lines here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a truly liberal Holy Father might have moved the Church towards the proverbial, doctrinal hat trick: allowing actively gay men to be Catholics, then ordaining them as priests, and then allowing them to marry their male partners. There’s a name for churches that condone that sort of thing, and that name is &ldquo;Episcopalian.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if you believe that your church was literally founded by the Son of God, based on principles he personally handed down to His followers (as Catholics do), why would you make your church’s doctrine conveniently open to revision by its flock? It’s like deliberately designing a bucket with holes in it, then wondering why it won’t hold any water.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you think this or any other pope is just plain wrong on celibacy or homosexuality or anything else big, and this upsets you so much it interferes with your spiritual life, you’d be well advised to find yourself another church. Otherwise you’re like the orthodox Jew who, in light of recent developments, has taken it upon himself to decide that it’s all right for him to eat pork. You can be an orthodox Jew, and you can eat pork. You’re free to do either one. But folks, you just can’t do both. There are names for Catholics who don’t accept that they can’t do certain things and still receive the sacraments, and one of those names is Senator John Kerry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And last but not least&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning of the &ldquo;tyranny of relativism&rdquo; that’s become so pervasive, Cardinal Ratzinger argued that it’s better to be guided by time-honored principles of morality than to be endlessly buffeted about by the myriad whims of conventional wisdom in the name of &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; With the clear implication being, if you don’t like these principles the rest of us here have agreed to live by, maybe this isn’t the Church for you. Or as my Dad used to say during dinner, if you don’t like what we’re serving here, try next door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good stuff.</p>

			 <p>I have this &ldquo;movies I&rsquo;ve watched recently&rdquo; link section on the side of the blog. I intended to list movies that I saw in the theater or on DVD. If you&rsquo;re a regular reader, you will have noted that it hasn&rsquo;t changed in quite some time.</p>
<p>I noted a progression yesterday while talking with Becky. We were thinking of renting Meet The Fockers, but decided to just watch something recorded on the Tivo instead. The progression goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back before we had Laura we&rsquo;d go watch movies in the theater.</li>
<li>Once Laura was born, we&rsquo;d wait until they came out on DVD.</li>
<li>Now that we got our Tivo, we&rsquo;ll end up waiting until the movie gets shown on TV. :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will have to break this chain for some movies; obviously when the new <a href="http://www.starwars.com">Star Wars</a> movie comes out I&rsquo;ll be watching it in the theater. But as a whole, I feel myself slipping more and more into behind-the-times oblivion, at least as far as pop culture goes. Oh well. It&rsquo;s not always bad to be out of touch. :-)</p>

			 <p>So the weather intervened this weekend and I didn&rsquo;t do any outside projects&hellip; apparently a high of 50 with the wind 25 mph from the north is not conducive for working outside. :-) I did get the lawn mowed, though. I live in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s mostly old retired folks, at least one of whom seems to have his personal ambition to make everybody else&rsquo;s lawns look terrible. This guy mows his lawn every 2 or 3 days, so it&rsquo;s always immaculate. I try to get mine mowed every week or so, but it usually still ends up looking shaggy.</p>
<p>So instead of outside projects I got a bunch of inside stuff done this weekend, which was OK with me. My list of little miscellaneous projects is always long, so this weekend shortened it up some. Receipts are done. Meeting minutes are typed up. The downstairs is cleaned up and swept. All in all, a profitable weekend. Then I taught Sunday School on Sunday and then in the afternoon bought a used CD that I&rsquo;m enjoying this morning: Eric Clapton&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=caedmonscalln-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=B000002MFE%2526location=/o/ASIN/B000002MFE%25253FSubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82" title="View product details at Amazon"><em>Unplugged</em></a>. I know, it&rsquo;s a 13-year-old album, but I&rsquo;m just finally getting around to it.</p>
<p>Such is my random life from this weekend. Hope you enjoyed it. :-)</p>

			 <p>Springtime has finally arrived in Iowa, and that means that the weekends become project time. That also means that it&rsquo;s time for my annual realization of how lazy I am. I like projects to an extent - specifically, I like the ones that are small, and have great observable effect when they&rsquo;re done. But now that it&rsquo;s spring time Becky has a list of outdoor projects that need done.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not disagreeing that they need done; they do need done, and they will improve the way our home/yard/garden looks when we get done. I just have trouble getting motivated. I like my winter Saturdays when I can get up late, read a book, watch TV, and be lazy. I will remember that I like summer Saturdays, too; but they&rsquo;re more characterized by work, sweat, and tiredness at the end of the day. Which is OK; I just have to remind myself that I <em>do</em> enjoy it - my laziness wants to tell me that I won&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p>
<p>So to put aside the navel gazing and introspection, this weekend we&rsquo;ll be doing some planters in the back yard. We&rsquo;re buying the landscape timbers today, and tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be cutting and assembling them. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even take a picture or two for illustration once we get done. Thinking about it now, it probably won&rsquo;t even take that long - Becky&rsquo;s got it all planned out how she wants it, so it should just be cut and assemble. At least, I can hope that it stays easy. Ahhh&hellip; the smell of sawdust. Now I guess that <em>is</em> something to look forward to.</p>

			 <p>It had been planned for about a month that I would fill the pulpit at <a href="http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org">my church</a> on April 24th. Then about a week ago I got asked if I could switch to the 17th, to fill in for our youth pastor who has been sick. So, on short notice, I think it turned out OK. You can listen to the second half of the sermon <a href="http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org/20050417.ram">here</a>&hellip; apparently the audio guys only managed to record half of it. Arrrgh.</p>
<p>The topic of the sermon is &ldquo;Three Characteristics of a Loving Follower&rdquo;, from Ephesians 5:1-2. It&rsquo;s not super-exciting, but one of my better efforts (of which only total 3, so I&rsquo;m relatively inexperienced here). And that&rsquo;s your little insight into Chris&rsquo;s life for today. :-)</p>

			 <p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/">Peggy Noonan</a> (one of my long-time favorite columnists, and a devout Roman Catholic) has <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006553">a column today on OpinionJournal</a> in which she crafts a tale of a group of Cardinals discussing and thinking over the qualifications for the next man who would be pope. I think she manages to hit on some of the characteristics that really mark a great leader.</p>
<p>(Now let&rsquo;s not let this get into a discussion on the theology of the RC church, or the relative merits of whether or not John Paul II was a believer&hellip; that&rsquo;s not the point. He was a great man and leader regardless.)</p>
<p>In Noonan&rsquo;s piece, a rather hardened and cynical old Cardinal is trying to understand why so many people felt so devoted to JPII, why this outpouring of devotion for an old sick man who was constantly telling people what they should/shouldn&rsquo;t do in regard to moral issues&hellip; what was the appeal? And then comes a moment of realization. She writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe&ndash;maybe . . . Maybe people, being imperfect and human, live whatever lives they live but deep in their hearts&ndash;way down deep and much more than they know&ndash;they actually notice when somebody stands for truth. And they actually honor it. Maybe that&rsquo;s why in all the big modern democracies they&rsquo;d burst into tears when John Paul came by, when he was visiting America and France and Germany. Maybe they knew they were not necessarily living right themselves but they were grateful&ndash;they were grateful on behalf of civilization!&ndash;that there was a man like him among us. They recognized him and honored him in their hearts. And then word came that he&rsquo;s dead and suddenly their hearts told their heads: Get on the train and go honor him. Because he adorned us. Because he was right. And we can&rsquo;t lose this from civilization, this beacon in the darkness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think she hits it here: <em>&ldquo;they actually notice when somebody stands for truth.</em> As a believer, I have Christ in me and I am called to live his truth. And as a person, I respond similarly when I see it in others. The qualities of a life well-lived, lived to uphold the truth. People like JPII. People closer to home, like Bob Dye, who has led the local Youth for Christ chapter for 35 years and radiates Christ through the community every day. People&hellip; just normal people, but who live out Christ&rsquo;s truth every day.</p>
<p>Near the end of Noonan&rsquo;s story, the Cardinals are in discussion about the qualities that will be needed in the new pope. One argues that the need a holy, devout man. Another argues that they also need a &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; - someone with an image and personality that will appeal to the younger generation. Then the voice of wisdom kicks in from a third.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem our duty is to choose a great man who is not necessarily a dramatic or endearing figure. The Holy Spirit will give him voice. Our time will need greatness. &lsquo;For nowadays the world is lit by lightning.'&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so she&rsquo;s quoting <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/gm/QUO.htm">Tennessee Williams</a> with that last line&hellip; but the point remains. The flashes of lightning that illuminate the world will be those that come from the hearts of the faithful. Thanks, Peggy, for the reminder.</p>

			 <p>I starting reading some of the other <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/about">rmfo blogs</a> and found <a href="http://rmfo-blogs.com/david/archives/2005/04/13/this-week-in-softball/">David&rsquo;s post</a> on softball. I&rsquo;m quite jealous that his season has already started; mine doesn&rsquo;t start for a couple weeks yet. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it hugely. Actually, I should call it &ldquo;our&rdquo; season&hellip; Becky and I play on a co-ed church league team. She&rsquo;s the die-hard softball player (played in high school), I&rsquo;m the recreational player.</p>
<p>This will be the first season that we&rsquo;ll have a little kiddo on the bench to take care of - Laura was born right at the end of last softball season. It&rsquo;s already been determined that I will be the one in charge of child care if somebody needs to sit with her during a game. Hey, I volunteered. I figure Becky missed almost all of last year (except for some heroics in the last game of the season&hellip; but that&rsquo;s another story) since she was pregnant so it&rsquo;s the least I can do. :-)</p>
<p>Well this is kind of a boring post but I&rsquo;m trying to figure out trackbacks and add some traffic to the new blog, so that&rsquo;s what you get for the day.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been on a web page design kick lately. First it was with my church&rsquo;s web page. The updates I made to it never hit the web; you can look at <a href="http://www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org">www.noelridgebaptistchurch.org</a> to see how badly it needs it. I think we&rsquo;re actually going to go to using a professional design site (<a href="http://www.faithconnector.com">www.faithconnector.com</a>) for our web pages; it&rsquo;s worth the cost to get a professional-looking site, and they offer some great features.</p>
<p>I got set up as a webmaster on a separate site last week; I&rsquo;m setting up a site for my pastor&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.recminusa.org">Reconciliation Ministries</a>. It&rsquo;s still in progress, but I&rsquo;m learning a lot. The last time I did web page design was about 5 years ago (check <a href="http://members.tripod.com/ThePianoMan/">this page</a> out&hellip; scary!) before they had cool things like css. I just bought a book on CSS and DHTML last night and it&rsquo;s going to save my butt when it comes to doing web pages.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;m a long way from being a professional, but it&rsquo;s fun to use my skills once in a while. Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills. :-)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2005/03/29/elder-older.html">elder = older?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://chrishubbs.com/2005/03/29/elder-older.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2005-03-29 12:15:50 -0500">Mar 29, 2005</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had several conversations lately regarding the qualifications for being an elder in the church, specifically in regard to how much a man&rsquo;s age should play into that qualification. I&rsquo;m still wrestling with the answers myself.</p>
<p>Let me start out by giving some background: I am 28 years old, and an &ldquo;elder apprentice&rdquo; in my church. That basically means that we have identified that I have the gifting of an elder and the desire to be one. The apprenticeship entails attending elders meetings, and performing any tasks they assign me. I&rsquo;ve been helping lead Bible studies, have preached a couple times, and have had a lot of input on the administrative side of things (which is where my gifting really is). We have 4 elders right now (including the 2 pastors) in a church of about 200. There are two of us that are starting our second year of apprenticeship.</p>
<p>So, back to qualifications before I add my 2 cents. On one hand, the qualifications given in Timothy and Titus don&rsquo;t mention age at all. They do mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without reproach</li>
<li>a &ldquo;one-woman&rdquo; man</li>
<li>self-controlled</li>
<li>hospitable</li>
<li>able to teach</li>
<li>not given to drunkenness</li>
<li>gentle</li>
<li>not quarrelsome</li>
<li>not a lover of money</li>
<li>a good manager of his own family</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there about age at all. In fact, in 2 Timothy, Paul specifically tells Timothy to not let people look down on him because of his youth&hellip; and we can be certain that Timothy was an elder in the assemblies he founded. So, I don&rsquo;t see that &ldquo;youth&rdquo; (however that is defined) is a disqualification.</p>
<p>My wife is of the opinion that men should at least be somewhat older - enough to have a family and some track record with how they manage their household. I didn&rsquo;t ask her then how single men would meet that qualification, but it seems like a reasonable question. My wife&rsquo;s bigger concern is just how much time it&rsquo;ll require of me if I become an elder&hellip; but that&rsquo;s an entirely different subject.</p>
<p>I had a discussion last night with an older woman whom I have a good deal of respect for. She is the mom of a good friend of mine, a woman who has raised 7 great kids and dealt with a difficult husband for 30+ years. She is prone to having slightly odd views on some things, though, so I take everything with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Her opinion was that to truly perform the &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo; function of eldering, a man really needs to have the experience that comes with age. She thought that maybe in one&rsquo;s 60&rsquo;s does one finally have the experience necessary to be a good shepherd. She has seen younger guys attempt it, and has seen them chewed up and spit out by churches that they were not ready to handle. She agreed with me that the gifts that an elder may have (i.e. teaching, administration, etc) should be used immediately, but that the true &ldquo;eldering&rdquo; (by which I think she means shepherding) requires people of a more senior age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really trying to understand where I fall on the subject, seeing as it affects how I want to serve in the body. Of our 4 elders right now, only 1 would fall into the &ldquo;60-and-above&rdquo; category that my friend suggests. He is over 70, recently suffered a stroke, and is struggling to see how much he can still serve in that role as he goes through rehabilitation. Two others are 50-ish, and the third is almost 40. They&rsquo;re all in different places in their lives and walks, some of them are more gifted at administration, others at teaching, but I see all these activities as &ldquo;shepherding&rdquo; in a way. So I just don&rsquo;t think I can accept the &ldquo;60-and-above&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>My bigger question is whether I am ready. My spiritual walk could use improvement; I feel like I should work on that before thinking I&rsquo;m ready to be an elder. Otherwise I think I meet the 1 Timothy 3 qualifications. But I&rsquo;m not very senior. But the elders think I&rsquo;m qualified and would be a good fit sometime in the next year or two. I guess I&rsquo;ve got to keep praying about it.</p>
<p>My real wish is that there were a few more senior mature men who could step in as elders so I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was so &ldquo;needed&rdquo;. I would be happy to see a couple other guys in those roles, teaching and mentoring guys like me, so that maybe in 10 years I&rsquo;d be in a better place to step into the role myself. But those guys don&rsquo;t exist in my church. There&rsquo;s only two who want to/are qualified to be apprentices. We&rsquo;re it. The church needs shepherding. I don&rsquo;t want to resist that call.</p>

			 <p>A book by this title was given to my by my pastor last week; we are &ldquo;kindred readers&rdquo; with an affinity for Eugene Peterson&rsquo;s practical written wisdom. I got no further than the introduction last night. This was partly due to my early morning and long day; but moreso due to my captivation with the poem from which the title came. It is an untitled sonnet written by Gerard Manley Hopkins, a 19th century poet and priest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame;<br>
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells<br>
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell&rsquo;s<br>
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;<br>
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:<br>
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;<br>
Selves &ndash; goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,<br>
Crying &ldquo;What I do is me: for that I came&rdquo;.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I say more: the just man justices;<br>
Keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces;<br>
Acts in God&rsquo;s eye what in God&rsquo;s eye he is &ndash; Christ.<br>
For Christ plays in ten thousand places,<br>
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his<br>
To the Father through the features of men&rsquo;s faces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem intrigues and delights me in ways I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to describe very well. But I think that it captures the essence of living out our lives in the Spirit every day. Christ &ldquo;plays&rdquo; throughout each of us as we live in Him. I am challenged this morning to meditate on Christ, and see how He might play out even more through my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to provide updates as I work my way through Peterson&rsquo;s book.</p>

			 <p>Has it really been 3 weeks since I&rsquo;ve posted? Good grief! No wonder nobody reads my blog&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll make this a general information-type post and maybe it&rsquo;ll be easier to write. :-)</p>
<p>Yesterday was my 28th birthday. Didn&rsquo;t do much very exciting; work all day and then meetings at church until 8:00 last night. We&rsquo;re going to go out for dinner tonight, so we&rsquo;re not avoiding partying, we&rsquo;re just delaying it.</p>
<p>Becky got me a Kyser Partial Capo (which I&rsquo;ve been thinking about buying for months and never have&hellip;) so I&rsquo;m really excited about that. Maybe this afternoon I can head home and try it out. I&rsquo;ve seen other people use them to great effect in performances, and I&rsquo;m hoping I can do the same. She also got me one of those plug-it-right-into-your-TV video game things, it has Pac Man, DigDug, and Galaxian. I do so love the retro games.</p>
<p>So all in all it wasn&rsquo;t a bad birthday. Birthdays, as a whole, change in tone as you get older. When you&rsquo;re a kid, you look forward to it for weeks, it&rsquo;s the most exciting day of the year (save Christmas), it&rsquo;s a huge deal. Now at 28, my birthday was really just another day. And that&rsquo;s OK with me. It is fun to have an excuse to go out for dinner and maybe buy something I&rsquo;ve been drooling over for a while&hellip; but then I can do that other days, too. So that&rsquo;s my ho-hum attitude this March the 15th. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m complaining&hellip; I&rsquo;m just learning to recognize the joys of every day.</p>

			 <p>I spend quite a bit of time hanging out at the online message board called &ldquo;<a href="http://rocksmyfaceoff.net/forum/">The Rumor Forum</a>&rdquo;. It is a group of people who are loosely grouped as fans of the group <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a>. Many of them have known each other for several years, have attended concerts and other get-togethers as a group, and in general are pretty good friends in real life. I, on the other hand, just started hanging out there about a year ago, haven&rsquo;t met any of them, etc. And yet somehow I find myself drawn in, wishing for acceptance and looking forward to each day&rsquo;s interaction. Why?</p>
<p>If I could answer that question, it&rsquo;d make my wife happier for sure, and might even make me happier&hellip; although I&rsquo;m not that grumpy to begin with. :-) I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s addicting. I don&rsquo;t know why I consider these people friends&hellip; and yet I do. Is it weird to have a friend you&rsquo;ve never met in person? Is it strange to consider interactions carried out entirely through your web browser as &ldquo;friendships&rdquo; in the first place? Such are my random thoughts on this Saturday morning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to meet some of these people. One of them might be coming to town on business sometime this spring, so I could get together with him for dinner or something&hellip; but many of the others may be people that I never really &ldquo;know&rdquo;, whose only face I see is the little avatar they put next to their online posts, whose history I know from reading their blogs&hellip; kinda weird, I guess. I&rsquo;d like to meet some of them for real. Somehow it would validate some of the thoughts I&rsquo;ve had towards them, which would be nice. And hey, it&rsquo;s always nice to make more friends&hellip; my friend list is rather limited, although I consider that the way God has it for now, rather than a complaint.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;God assumed from the beginning that the wise of the world would view Christians as fools &hellip; and He has not been disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This insight was voiced by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia recently <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/stories/012305/new_scalia001.shtml">while addressing a Knights of Columbus gathering</a>. Scalia is a staunch Catholic, and while I won&rsquo;t agree with all of his religious beliefs as part of the Roman Catholic church, he has this one exactly right. Paul wrote about this in First Corinthians chapter 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>20Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than man&rsquo;s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man&rsquo;s strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Christians, we are constantly told by the world today that we are stupid for believing what we do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you smart enough to know that evolution is the way it happened and that creation is a myth? Are you so stupid as to believe that there is a God who is all-powerful? Have you yet to gain the understanding that we are the ultimate arbiters of what is moral? Come on, how stupid can you be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At times I find it disheartening; at times only frustrating When I gain the correct perspective, then I can finally look past the insults and criticism to realize that I have a knowledge (through no merit of my own) that they don&rsquo;t have, and regardless of how they ridicule me, it is still my duty to proclaim what I know to be true.</p>
<p>I look at it this way: if I were walking by somebody&rsquo;s house and saw it burning, they&rsquo;d want me to come tell them so they could escape. But what if I was walking by and somehow knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that their house was burning, even though they didn&rsquo;t understand why. Wouldn&rsquo;t I still have the moral imperative to tell them? If this were the case I would also be trying anything in my control to try to help them to understand how I knew.</p>
<p>In the case of my beliefs, they won&rsquo;t be able to understand unless the Spirit enables them to respond to the message. However, I still have the moral imperative (and the command from God) to keep speaking the message, even if I am called a fool for saying it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where I have to do some self-evaluation. I generally don&rsquo;t like to be thought a fool. (Who does?) While I&rsquo;m not willing to go change my beliefs so people won&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m stupid, I too often keep my mouth shut when I really shouldn&rsquo;t&hellip; thus providing the impression that I&rsquo;m not a fool, when if I told them what I believed, they&rsquo;d think I was. I think I need to open my mouth more. I&rsquo;ll have to pray for the boldness to do it.</p>
<p>Scalia again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If I have brought any message today, it is this: Have the courage to have your wisdom regarded as stupidity. Be fools for Christ. And have the courage to suffer the contempt of the sophisticated world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider yourself challenged. I know I am.</p>

			 <p>So I got an iPod for Christmas&hellip; and of course the next task is ripping all of my CDs to mp3s so I can put them on the iPod. That was a task in itself. I&rsquo;m almost done&hellip; (done with all the popular music, about halfway through the classical.) So then I got curious and started wondering about converting all the cassette tapes that I&rsquo;ve got&hellip; (there&rsquo;s not as many as the CDs, only probably a dozen that I&rsquo;d care about converting, but still&hellip;)</p>
<p>So I researched it a bit online and figured out that by running a cable from the headphone jack of my tape deck into the line in input of my PC, I can record those old tapes. And the free dBPowerAmp software is really slick for recording them; it will automagically sense dead time between songs and split it out into separate mp3 files&hellip; too cool. So, now that the geek in me was satisfied with my use of technology, I could get on to recording all of my high school tapes. And that was the scary part.</p>
<p>I was a big Michael W. Smith fan in high school. So of course some of the first tapes to get converted were his albums The Big Picture, Go West Young Man, Change Your World, and The Live Set. (To be fair, a couple of those were done when I was middle-school-aged&hellip; and I just picked them up in high school. :-)) And then there were a couple old Amy Grant albums, and Michael English&rsquo;s two good albums that he released before his confession-of-an-affair-and-returning-all-his-Dove-awards debacle. And an old Steven Curtis Chapman album or two.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and recognize all these names, then you&rsquo;ll also recognize that my musical scope was a bit limited in high school; my folks were pretty adamant that Christian music was the only choice (although jazz and classical were also OK), and I was remarkably content with that. The downside is that now as an adult I feel like I missed a few things&hellip; but that also makes for neat discoveries. I got the 2-CD set The Essential Bob Dylan this weekend and I&rsquo;m enjoying it immensely. Probably wouldn&rsquo;t have appreciated it when I was 17.</p>
<p>What a difference a decade makes.</p>

			 <p>Or so my sister tells me. Of course, she&rsquo;s 17, a senior in highschool, and has the time to keep up her blog. But the least I can do is actually give it a shot. Don&rsquo;t know how interesting it&rsquo;ll be, but I&rsquo;ll give it a try. This will probably be more informational than thoughtful, but if info&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after, then you&rsquo;re all set.</p>
<p>I watched a couple interesting high-school movies the other night: the recent <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/">Napoleon Dynamite</a>, and then <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0162346/">Ghost World</a>, which is 4 or 5 years old. Napoleon Dynamite is a hit among some of my friends, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I&rsquo;d think of it. I laughed at parts, and was generally amused by the whole thing. It&rsquo;s one of those films that my wife just rolls her eyes at (&ldquo;that&rsquo;s two hours I&rsquo;m never getting back&rdquo;) but I enjoyed the pastiche of the high school life. It certainly sums up the experience of being a loser in high school. And I just have to have appreciation for a movie where basically no one is a decent actor in the whole movie, and that&rsquo;s almost the point; the guys just have blank-faced stares the whole time. Am I rambling here? Have I made any sense? I dunno. Yep, that&rsquo;s pretty much the movie.</p>
<p>Ghost World was different. It was snappy, incisive, and incredibly profane. But at the same time it painted a good picture of two girls headed different directions in life, and their search for life after high school. While the language/dialog probably prevents me from recommending this to everyone, I really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why the sudden interest in high school movies; I was home schooled and never went to high school. I guess I&rsquo;m reverting back 10 years for a little while. :-)</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the interesting news from my life today. Now it&rsquo;s back to work.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s a weird thing to get older; and then in a way it&rsquo;s the most natural thing we ever do, since we&rsquo;re all doing it all the time. The latest realization of this was when I ran across my little sister&rsquo;s blog (see link to the right).</p>
<p>Rebecca is 10 years younger than me; I remember her primarily as the little girl, as a preschooler and elementary-schooler. I left home for college when she was not quite 8, so my memories of her after that are fewer and farther between. She&rsquo;s now 17. Where has time gone? It&rsquo;s so strange to read her posts where she does all the normal teenage-girl-type things, agonizing over boys (mostly asking why are they so awful, and why are none of them like her awesome brother (not me, though I wish it were :-))) and quoting lyrics from angsty (is that a word?) songs. Come to think of it, I was a lot that way when I was a teenager&hellip;</p>
<p>Part of me feels better when I remember that she&rsquo;s going through the normal teenage stuff, and that she will get past it, and will have a great life. The other part of me wants to just be protective and make things all work out for her, which I know I can&rsquo;t. Arrrgh. All I can do is hope and pray that she makes the right decisions (she&rsquo;s doing a good job so far) and that God works things out. I know He has good plans, but it&rsquo;s hard to trust.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t told her yet that I&rsquo;m reading her blog; I don&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;ll be OK with it or if she&rsquo;ll be mortified that her older brother is reading the same stuff that her friends are. I&rsquo;ll promise not to be peeved that when she was writing her eternal post (she had a contest with a friend for the longest post, and she won) she mentioned her other three brothers, but not me&hellip; :-) Well at some point I guess I&rsquo;ll tell her. Maybe it&rsquo;ll help us communicate better. Maybe I can even give her a link to mine&hellip;.</p>

			 <p>This morning we are experiencing one of those fun office moments known as &ldquo;network downtime&rdquo;. Nobody can get logged in and even if you can (I managed somehow), nothing works; all of the network drives are dead. Fortunately, Internet access still works, so I can post a little blog like this one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting listening to the buzz around here; people are talking where normally there is only silence and people working. I doubt anybody&rsquo;s gotten anything done all morning, so right now I&rsquo;m going on 2+ hours of downtime. Take that times 4000 people or so at RC and at the billing rate that engineers cost, and we&rsquo;re up to almost $1Million in general time while we&rsquo;re all waiting for the network.</p>
<p>I should really find something more interesting to blog about; I&rsquo;ve seen some people with long, thoughtful posts; however, I guess I don&rsquo;t find the time for long, thoughtful writing. I mean, I can when I need to or want to, but I guess I spend so much time of each day just getting work and normal stuff done that I don&rsquo;t take a lot of time to just sit and think and write. It&rsquo;s really too bad; I do have actual thoughts about stuff on a semi-regular basis.</p>

			 <p>After thinking things couldn&rsquo;t get better from last week&rsquo;s Caedmon&rsquo;s Call concert, last Friay I took my wife to see <a href="http://www.derekwebb.com/">Derek Webb</a> at <a href="http://www.augustana.edu/">Augustana College</a> in Rock Island, Illinois. The venue was terrific; Wallenberg Hall there at Augustana is small enough that the seats only went back about 10 rows deep; I got a seat on the center aisle in the third row, and was only 6 or 8 feet from the stage (which was only about a foot high). It was awesome. The crowd was warm and receptive, and by the time Derek came out, they were very ready to hear some good tunes. They were not disappointed.</p>
<p>Derek was presenting lots of songs from his new album, I See Things Upside Down. The sound is a departure from his old, Caedmon&rsquo;s sound (also found on his first album, She Must and Shall Go Free) &ndash; none of the acoustic simplicity that was the trademark of the earlier days; this new sound is a much more modern sound, inspired by artists like WILCO and Ryan Adams. It is different, but the excellent songwriting still shines through the wall of sound. They played for nearly 90 minutes, not talking very much in between (a departure of sorts from other Webb concerts). The musical highlight of the night was when things slowed down and Derek performed Nothing Is Ever Enough as a solo with only his electric guitar; an incredible sound on a beautiful song.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t get to meet Derek afterwards; the band hustled off to somewhere, and we had to head home; the babysitter was waiting. :-) Didn&rsquo;t get home &lsquo;til midnight, and had a great time.</p>

			 <p>Went with my brother Ryan to a <a href="http://www.caedmonscall.com">Caedmon&rsquo;s Call</a> concert Friday night at <a href="http://www.judsoncollege.edu">Judson College</a> in Elgin, IL. It was my first time seeing Caedmon&rsquo;s in person; they&rsquo;ve been a favorite of mine via CD for 5 or so years now. They totally met (if did not exceed) expectations. The band rocked, they played a lot of good songs, they came off as much more real than most performers do. You get the feeling they&rsquo;re just a group of folks that like to play and sing music, and they&rsquo;re letting us in on a jam session.</p>
<p>I really only had two wishes unfulfilled at the end of the night; the first was that I didn&rsquo;t get to meet <a href="http://www.andrewosenga.com">Andy Osenga</a>, the new lead guitar player (and sometime lead singer) for the band. I think he was visiting with his family after the show, didn&rsquo;t participate in the meet and greet. The second wish really only developed during the show: I wish I would&rsquo;ve had a chance to see them when <a href="http://www.derekwebb.com">Derek Webb</a> was still a member of the band. His songs are such an integral part of their repertoire, and his voice and presence such a crucial part of their sound&hellip; and that&rsquo;s not a knock on Andy O., that&rsquo;s just the way it is. Oh well, it was still a great concert. They stay at the top of my favorite groups list.</p>

<p>The election is over. Kerry conceded without putting up a big fight. No big lawsuits. No big charges of voting fraud. Tom Daschle got beat in South Dakota. (My respect for South Dakotans just went up by a couple orders of magnitude.) The Republicans picked up more seats in the Senate and the House. Things look like they might just calm down politically for a while&hellip; at least until some seats on the Supreme Court open up, then they&rsquo;ll be back to the old tricks.</p>
<p>I would be much remiss if I didn&rsquo;t at least mention a nice <a href="http://ijsm.org/archives/2004/11/03/numbers-game/">statistical analysis</a> that a guy I&rsquo;m familiar with (he runs the Caedmon&rsquo;s Call fan website) posted on his blog last night in the middle of the Ohio discussion&hellip; way to go, Geof!</p>

			 <p>Well it&rsquo;s the day before the national elections and living in Iowa that means we&rsquo;re finally near the end of interminable political advertising, phone calls, and print ads. In the last week I think we&rsquo;ve received 3 or 4 recorded phone calls, tons of mail every day, three people at the door, and endured more TV ads than anyone should have to watch. I&rsquo;m not much of a channel surfer, but I finally started flipping around just to avoid having to watch the same ads over and over and over&hellip;</p>
<p>While it saddens me that the presidential candidates can&rsquo;t seem to campaign on anything but &ldquo;here&rsquo;s why my opponent&rsquo;s bad&rdquo;, I guess I&rsquo;ve come to expect it. What really makes me mad is that the same mudslinging comes to the local races. In my Iowa House district, we&rsquo;ve recieved at least half a dozen mailings, including ones from <a href="http://www.rogergrobstich.com/">Roger Grobstich</a>, the challenger, totally bashing <a href="http://www.kraigpaulsen.com/">Kraig Paulsen</a>, the incumbent (a Republican), and also one that was a &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of a handwritten letter from Paulsen&rsquo;s wife, urging us to vote for him. Why can&rsquo;t they just run on the issues? Are there not enough issues to run on? In Iowa, we&rsquo;ve got education, government spending, and taxes, just to name a few. Tell me whether or not you&rsquo;re going to raise my taxes (honestly, now), where you stand on gambling, the lottery, the speed limits, things I really care about. Sure, your website has little niceities on all these issues, but why can&rsquo;t you run on them? Why do you have to sling mud and badmouth? Do you really think I&rsquo;m going to respond to a mailing that tells me that my representative is a shill for corporate interests? I work for a corporate interest. That means I&rsquo;m interested in their business doing well. Big business isn&rsquo;t evil to me - it keeps food on the table.</p>
<p>At least tomorrow it will all be over&hellip; oh wait, then there will be legal wranglings, lawsuits, protests, recounts, and allegations of fraud. My prayer is just that somebody be a clear winner on Tuesday; I don&rsquo;t think I can handle a repeat of the 2000 debacle.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Chris Hubbs, and I approve this message.</p>

			 <p>Seems like I should have something profound for the first blog entries, and I can&rsquo;t think of anything. Oh well, I guess I can just jump right in to normal life and after a few days it won&rsquo;t seem awkward because it&rsquo;ll be past.</p>
<p>Talked to Lydia last night for the first time in probably 8 years. Haven&rsquo;t seen her in probably 15 years. It was good to talk to her. Heard her voice to from sad to happy in about 2 seconds, which was really nice. We&rsquo;ve fortunately managed to avoid that awkwardness that comes from having a very different relationship 10 years ago; I think we&rsquo;re going to be fine with the fact that we&rsquo;ve moved on, that I&rsquo;m married with a kid now and she&rsquo;s living her own life. It&rsquo;s so cool&hellip; really kinda fun to have a friend from that long ago.</p>
<p>Took a long walk last night on a beautiful, soggy night outside. Makes me wish I lived in Seattle or Scotland or something. But here I am in Iowa. :-)</p>
